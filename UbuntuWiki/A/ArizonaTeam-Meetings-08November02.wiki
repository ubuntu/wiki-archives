[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:02:13] <tyche>	Oh, wait a minute,  I didn't need to do that one.  Hee hee
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:02:18] <kennymc0>	lol
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:02:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, lets go then
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:03:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	first off, who has installed intrepid?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:03:38] <kennymc0>	me
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:03:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok,
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:03:50] <tyche>	I know kennymc0 has.  He's complained enough.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:03:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	kennymc0: any problems?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:03:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	and
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:03:59] <kennymc0>	a few
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:04:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	how did you install?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:04:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	live cd, alt cd, upgrade
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:04:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:04:16] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: installed it on a couple of machines, but haven't played w/ it
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:04:22] <kennymc0>	tried the upgrade at first and that didnt work so i installed from the live cd
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:04:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:04:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	well the reason i ask is
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:04:40] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: installed from the CD, then used that install to make a USB bootable image and installed from that
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:04:56] <xHans>	there's a menu option for making the USB bootable image :)
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	i have had no luck with the live cd or the alternate cd on either of my boxes
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	:(
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: yeah
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:15] <xHans>	there's already a new kernel package
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:17] <tyche>	And there's 4 pages of problems on the Forums
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:30] <xHans>	kennymc0: what borked in the upgrade?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'm getting a busybox error msg at the first screen
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:41] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: would they boot?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: yeah
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:44] <tyche>	We're back to busybox, again.  Like Hardy was
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:05:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: nope
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	they wouldn't even check the cd for errors
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:01] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: did you try acpi=off?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: yep
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	and about 8 other things
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:18] <kennymc0>	with my upgrade the cursor was having a seizure in the middle of the screen
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:19] <xHans>	maybe that's why there's a kernel update
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:35] <kennymc0>	and whenever i tried to move it it would snap back instantly
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	well, a kernel update is great, but
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:43] <tyche>	Yea, but we have 400 coasters coming from Shipit
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	it won't help with no install
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:06:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	:(
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	this is a problem as far as i'm concerned
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:17] <slofgren>	so 8.10 is bad?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:25] <kennymc0>	and there are some problems with the nvidia settings manager
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	slofgren: don't know
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:37] <kennymc0>	have to use a workaround to get it to save changes
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	some, maybe most aren't having a problme
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:42] <tyche>	That's what I'm hearing.  You'll probably hear more, tomorrow, when I try it.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:47] <slofgren>	I dlit but have not installed
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	but i have never had a problem
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	and like tyche said
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:07:56] <slofgren>	wanting to put in VM first
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:08:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	there are 4 pages or more of threads on the forums about this problme
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:08:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	and no pat solution
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:09:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	to me, this affects the possibilty of a successful installfest
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:09:08] <kennymc0>	yeah not looking too good
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:09:21] <tyche>	Disaster, is more like it.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:09:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	we could have maybe up to 25% of the boxes not being able to take the install
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:09:32] <kennymc0>	wouldnt want to have an install fest when even the people running it could be having problems with it
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:09:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	:(
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:09:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	i don't like those kind of odds
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:09:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	kennymc0: right
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:10:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	i looked on the intrepid release page for the schedule of 8.10.1
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:10:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	but it's not there
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:10:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think it's usually about 30 days
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:10:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:10:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	does that sound right?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:10:49] <tyche>	Yea, about that.  Maybe 45
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:10:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok all
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:11:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche and i have been discussing the issue
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:11:15] <kennymc0>	dont know all i know is that 8.04.1 just popped out of nowhere on me
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:11:16] <kennymc0>	lol
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:11:25] <tyche>	I move that we postpone the installfest.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:11:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	we think we should maybe delay the installfest
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:12:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	kennymc0: what are you're thoughts?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:12:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: you too
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:12:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:12:22] <kennymc0>	yeah at least until we know how to resolve most if not all these problems
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:12:25] <xHans>	does Canonical agree there are issues? the Ubuntu release team?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:12:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	slofgren: you too
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:12:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: i haven't had a chance to discuss it with them yet
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:12:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	but
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:12:50] <tyche>	xHans: As yet, I don't think they realize the magnitude of the problem.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	i plan on doing that monday or tuesday
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:07] <xHans>	please report it :)
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	don't worry
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:13] <slofgren>	you don't want to hold an install fest and look like you don't know what you are doing
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'm pretty upset at this point
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:41] <tyche>	A failure, now, could screw up our chances of getting Arizona in the groove.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'm no techie, but i should be able to get it installed
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:46] <slofgren>	use 8.04.1 for the install fest ;)
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:56] <kennymc0>	that's not a bad idea
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:13:59] <slofgren>	srsly
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:14:05] <kennymc0>	it's an LTS so it is still current
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:14:18] <slofgren>	it is still Ubuntu ans till a good version
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:14:21] <slofgren>	I rock it
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:14:25] <tyche>	But people will be looking for Intrepid.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:14:30] <slofgren>	who
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:14:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	slofgren: we could do that, but it looks bad i think and how do we tell people that we are doing that because of major problems with 8.10
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:14:41] <slofgren>	new people to linux won't know
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:14:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	true
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:14:50] <slofgren>	if they need a an install fest they won't care
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:00] <xHans>	if it's really horked ( and it hasn't been for me ), then maybe it needs to be withdrawn until it's corrected
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:06] <slofgren>	johnc4510-laptop: think vista
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:07] <tyche>	You'd be surprised.  Many of them would know the difference.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	slofgren: lol
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:23] <kennymc0>	we can tell them the truth that like any new version of an operating system it's not always the best idea to jump into it until it has been out for a while
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:23] <tyche>	Think Windows 7
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:23] <slofgren>	then just explain it truthfully
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:38] <xHans>	plans for the Installfests will depend on how Ubuntu deals with the problems
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:42] <slofgren>	don't make it look like what it is not
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: i agree
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:51] <slofgren>	being honest would pay off best
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:15:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	slofgren: true, i would never do that
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:10] <xHans>	if it's horked, we need to admit it's horked and fix it
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:11] <slofgren>	frankly Ubuntu has had many many problmes with reaslease but in general it works well
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:15] <kennymc0>	we can always try to install it and if there are problems we can switch to hardy
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, well. here are the facts
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:26] <tyche>	I still think that this needs to be fought out internally, first.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:26] <azteech>	johnc4510 - all I know is that until they fix the problem, am staying with LTS ... maybe use the 8.10 on a online system, to help troubleshoot, but think this needs working out before I recommend it - highly recommend we postpone the installfest until we see some improvement
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	the 16th was not available at the colleges
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	and the next weekend is pretty close to thanksgiving
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:55] <johnc4510-laptop>	so
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:16:57] Join	virginpidgin has joined this channel (n=virginpi@97.72.42.106).
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:17:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	that leaves the 7th of Dec
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:17:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	and that's it in dec
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:17:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	because
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:17:33] Quit	calimer has left this server (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)).
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:17:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'll be gone after the 14th
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:17:44] <azteech>	if it is borked - then it should also be taken off the download list ...
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:17:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	so
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:17:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	here are the choices
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:18:11] <kennymc0>	i think by december 7th the problems should be taken care of in theory
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:18:12] 	 * xHans == azteech 
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:18:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	1. 7th of dec., or after the first of the yr
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:18:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	my thoughts are these
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:18:31] <azteech>	xHans == evening
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:18:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	we should schedule for the 7th, and see if it gets fixed
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:18:52] 	 * slofgren waves at xHans 
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	if not, we can re-decide whether or not to keep the date or not
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	what thinks all of you on that?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:31] <tyche>	+1
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:35] <kennymc0>	+1
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:37] <xHans>	moin moin slofgren
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:42] <azteech>	If we go with a date of the 7th, then would recommend that we maake it a tenative date ..
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:46] <slofgren>	sounds good johnc4510-laptop
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: agreed
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:19:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	btw
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:20:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	there is another thing to consider
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:20:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	when do the colleges get out for xmas vacation?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:20:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	and when are exams
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:20:31] <xHans>	if you make it the 29th it's the same time as the monthly Installfest
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:20:34] <azteech>	what is the likely hood of this being all ironed out by then?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:20:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: that's an idea
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:20:53] <xHans>	if you make it the 7th, we can see about moving the November Installfest, which often happens anyway
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:21:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: i would hope that it is ironed out in the next wk or 2 at the most
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:21:19] <tyche>	xHans: That's a good thought.
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:21:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: k
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:21:36] <tyche>	it would be good to have a joint installfest
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:21:46] <slofgren>	I would always promote the LTS version at any install fest
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:21:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'll have to check with zane and my contact at u of a
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:21:54] <xHans>	can you run the CD self-check from another machine?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:21:56] <azteech>	if I recall, UofA is out for holidays as of the 23rd ...
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:22:02] <xHans>	is it just an md5sum test?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:22:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: i tried it on both boxes
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:22:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	nothing
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:22:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	:(
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:22:22] <azteech>	is it the download?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:22:28] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: I mean check it from the box you're using now :)
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:22:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	i did the md5sum and they were good
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:22:33] <azteech>	could it be bad?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:22:37] <xHans>	on the CD as well?

[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:23:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's a puzzle
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:23:30] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: ok, sounds like there's a problem with the release :)
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:23:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech:  yes
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:23:40] <azteech>	kk

[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:23:42] <xHans>	azteech: if the md5sums verify....
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:23:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	i tried torrents and the regular download    2 different torrents in fact
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:24:08] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: maybe get the md5sums from a couple of places and make sure they're the same as what you have
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:24:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: yep i even did that
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:24:31] <azteech>	xhans, would normally agree -
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:24:32] <xHans>	not that teaching a security class would make me paranoid and suspect mitm attacks... :)
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:24:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	really, i've tried almost everything i could think of
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:24:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol

[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:25:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: i'll secure the dates tentatively and let you know
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:25:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: yeah

[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:29:13] <xHans>	anyone want to do a presentation on new features in Intrepid?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:29:24] <tyche>	>SNICKER<
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:29:31] <xHans>	Intrepid being borkes is a valid part of the presentation
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:29:31] <azteech>	my thoughts are this, 1) if we try for shooting for the 7th of December, what is the likely hood of getting new cd's by then? 2) will bugs be worked out? or do we wait, and give them plenty of time to fix the issue(s) and give them time to get us new cd's (or work arounds - which I hate) - and shoot for the 29th, with the possibility of having a good installfest?
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:29:32] <slofgren>	xHans: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lugy/
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:29:41] <slofgren>	xHans: yes..I am on PLUG
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:29:45] <xHans>	other good things to announce, even if there are problems

[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:30:05] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: maybe we can fix it during your presentation :)
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:30:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: we won't get new cds from shipit no matter what
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:30:45] <azteech>	kk
[Sun Nov 2 2008] [21:30:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	but i would hope the problem would be fixed for sure
