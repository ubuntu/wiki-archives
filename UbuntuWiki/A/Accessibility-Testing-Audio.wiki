=== Audio and Alert Testing ===

Most of the content on this page was taken from <nowiki>[[http://library.gnome.org/devel/accessibility-devel-guide/nightly/id2599416.html.en | Gnome Testing]]</nowiki>.

There should be an option in the application to show audio alerts visually. This allows use by the hearing impaired. These tests do require a working sound card and speakers or headphones.

Test that the audio is working correctly by enabling sound and then perform the following actions:
* Perform an action that should generate an audio alert and confirm that the application is working as designed.
* Insure that audio alerts are showing visually, as well as through the speakers.
* Verify that the application works correctly when increasing or decreasing the volume.
* Confirm that warning messages and alerts can be heard correctly in a noisy work environment.
