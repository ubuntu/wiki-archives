== Introduction ==

Welcome to the Arizona LoCo Team Installfest planning page for the Hardy Heron 8.04 release. The link below shows general guidelines and suggestions from Ubuntu on running this type of event.

* Ubuntu Guidelines for Installfests: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoRunningInstallfests|Ubuntu Installfests]]</nowiki>

=== Plans ===

* Initial plans are to have the Installfests between 4 to 6 weeks after the introduction of the next Ubuntu release. Hardy Heron 8.04 is the next release, and it is due out in April of 2008. From past experience, these releases come out somewhere around the 18th of the month. It would therefore make sense to plan the event for somewhere between the 15th and the 31st of May. (We need to decide what day of the week and during what time periods we want to do the event)

* Finding a location in Phoenix is of major concern. Size is not of great concern, but internet access, plenty of outlets, bathroom facilities, solid tables, chairs, access to food and drink, and the ability to display some kind of signs, banners, or posters is necessary.

* Advertising should be of importance if we want to have a successful event. Local radio, colleges, libraries, newspapers, coffee shops, etc. should be informed and/or small window posters distributed too.

* We should consider looking into having some cheap silkscreen T-shirts made up for the team members to wear, making us visible to the people looking for help.

* I also believe we can request an "Event Package" from Ubuntu that I believe includes a banner. (I will look into that and see what is offered)

=== Material Requirements ===

* Manpower
* Install Disks (Default and Alternate)
* Power Strips & Extension Cords
* Leaflets to pass out about our LoCo
* Signs, banners, and/or posters
* Some kind of cart to help people bring in the boxes
* Cameras
* GPG Key-signing materials(if we so decide)

The team has done it again! A great event that provided fun, friendship, teamwork, and Ubuntu advocacy. Well done!! Members met in Phoenix to do installs, give out Ubuntu Live CDs, and show the area what Ubuntu and our team is all about. This was definitely a successful event and you can see it by looking at the pictures below. w00t, Arizona team, "The Hottest Loco on Earth".
