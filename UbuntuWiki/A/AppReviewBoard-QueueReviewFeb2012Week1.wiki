* '''7 apps''' in "Needs Information" state, that require reviewer's attention

'''Low-hanging fruit (7 out of 20):'''
# <nowiki>[[#TagPlayer|Tagplayer]]</nowiki> (PPA ready for review, uses Python and Quickly)
# <nowiki>[[#Guallet|Guallet]]</nowiki> (source package ready for review)
# <nowiki>[[#MemoryCardGame|Memory card game]]</nowiki> (Needs packaging, but it's an extremely small QML app)

# <nowiki>[[#RevisionMonitor|Revision Monitor]]</nowiki> (PPA ready for review)
# <nowiki>[[#LicenseManager|license manager]]</nowiki> (source package ready for review)
# <nowiki>[[#FraminghamCalculator|Framingham Calculator]]</nowiki> (source package and PPA ready for review, Quickly app)

'''Complex apps (4 out of 20):'''
# <nowiki>[[#ScndGenesisLegends|THE SCND GENESIS: LEGENDS]]</nowiki> (Game, 80+ Mb)
# <nowiki>[[#NuvolaMusicPlayer|Nuvola Music Player]]</nowiki> (codebase bigger than the usual entry on the queue, uses the net to connect to cloud music services)
# <nowiki>[[#TetraCity|TetraCity]]</nowiki> (Game, codebase bigger than the usual entry on the queue)
# <nowiki>[[#TerraView42|TerraView 4.2]]</nowiki> (140+ Mb)

'''Apps on which developer asks for help or need other kind of attention:'''
# <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/144/feedback/|Color Grab]]</nowiki> (The developer asks for help with package dependencies, as one of them does not exist in Oneiric.)
# <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/462/feedback/|Ubuntu Tweak]]</nowiki> (The developer asks whether some files can be installed outside /opt.)
# <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/575/feedback/|Symphaty]]</nowiki> (The developer expresses his lack of experience with .deb packages, and states he had uploaded a corrected file with something that seems to be a pre-built package.)
# <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/204/feedback/|Analyze3DObject]]</nowiki> (The comment concerns unavailability (on Linux) of the compiler this app needs.)
# <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/142/feedback/|Persy]]</nowiki> (The developer seems to have problem with re-uploading file, asks whether did it correctly, but application is still in Needs Information phase)
# <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/271/feedback/|SkypeTab]]</nowiki> (The application is said to be rewritten and resent.)
# <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/540/feedback/|Bottles]]</nowiki> (I'm not sure if ARB feedback is needed there, the developer seems to have decided to get the application to universe, yet he asks Jonathan to sponsor the upload.)

=== Review ===

1. <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/168/|Guallet]]</nowiki>

'''Summary:'''
* Typo in short description: 'How you manage your wallet?'
* Other than that, ready to review

'''Packaging review:'''
* The submission contains a source package
* I haven't checked for the correctness of the package

'''Code review:'''
* Python
* The code complexity is low enough to review
* Couldn't spot any malicious code or anything that messes about with the system
* It would be a perfect candidate to be ported to Quickly. I'd be tempted to suggesting that
* All code comments in Spanish :)
* It does not follow standard practices in a few places. Not sure if this should be a reason to ask to resubmit. Some examples:
** Translations location hardcoded to a non-standard path
** Uses libglade instead of gtkbuilder
** Harcodes a few paths

'''Next steps:'''
** Review package
** Give feedback on MyApps

----

2. <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/179/|pac]]</nowiki>

'''Summary:'''
** Needs a source package to be submitted

'''Packaging review:'''
** Developer might need help packaging. Last feedback from developer on MyApps:
"Hi! Thanks for your anser! I have absolutely no idea on building .deb packages (that's why I use "epm" and its corresponding pac.list file built by me) :( I have absolutely no problem in changing everything you mention, except for the binaries you mention (those Vte.so files), since I have not found them for Ubuntu in the usual "channles" (only at Getdeb.net), that's why I put them in the .deb package, and of course, the code ready to look for those binaries (32 and 64 bit) there. Please, let me know if that is any problem, or any solution you may find. Thanks a lot in advance!!  * David."

'''Code review:'''
** I can't do Perl :/

'''Next steps:'''
** Suggestions:
** Package it up
** Help the author packaging it
** Reject on the grounds that the ARB does not have capacity to package all apps

3. <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/192/|Unicode Rewriter]]</nowiki>

* QML with minimal C++ code

* Alternatively, it's a simple enough codebase for anyone with packaging experience in Qt/QML to tackle

----

12. <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/398/|Duplicati]]</nowiki>

'''Summary:'''

'''Summary:'''

'''Packaging review:'''

* Source is available from the upstream subversion repository, sloccount puts it at about 400kLOC.
