== Introduction ==

I'm studying Computer Science (Hons) at University of Glasgow and I'm currently interested in project management
and developing new products.

== Community Involvement ==

This is my first attempt to join in this community. I want to learn more about how to develop pieces of software and fix bugs. I'm using Ubuntu for more than a year now and I feel that I want to give back something and more than that I think it's an interesting experience. Moreover, I think it's a good place where you can get your hands on actual products and try to apply your skills gained so far.

== Future Hopes ==

I as I said in previous topic I want to be a project manager someday and be able to teach others what I learned.

== Testimonials ==
This is where other people will write testimonials about your work. You don't actually write anything here, let others do the writing :)
