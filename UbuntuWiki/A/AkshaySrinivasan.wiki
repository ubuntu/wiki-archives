'''About Me'''

I'm one of those geeks who really like to get their hands dirty - in every possible sense. Linux has been more of a hobby , from the day we had Mandrake -now Mandriva- installed on our Desktop. I've been using Linux for about 3-4 years. I'm currently working for a bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering from NITK, Surathkal.
