21:08 < slofgren> we are all up to date
21:08 < johnc4510-laptop> great
21:08 < slofgren> and the automated backups are working
21:08 < johnc4510-laptop> so far i'm very impressed with drupal
21:08 < johnc4510-laptop> ah nice
21:09 < johnc4510-laptop> i know the cron is updating every 30 mins. as we discussed
21:09 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:09 < slofgren> I will work on staying on top of securing it
21:09 < johnc4510-laptop> great
21:09 < kennymc0> cool
21:09 < johnc4510-laptop> have you seen my nick on the AKA list of offenders?
21:09 < johnc4510-laptop> :(
21:09 < slofgren> seems like PHP sites get cracked after time
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> ok
21:10 < kennymc0> what are you talking about johnc4510-laptop?
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> since we have xHans here i'd like to talk about email servers
21:10  * slofgren wonders with kennymc0
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> kennymc0: nm
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> lolo
21:10 < slofgren> johnc4510-laptop: ok
21:10 < kennymc0> i'm confused
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> joke
21:10 < kennymc0> uh huh.......
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> xHans: we could use your input
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> on email servers
21:11 < tyche> AKA = American Kennel Association.
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:11 < xHans> johnc4510-laptop: block port 25 :)
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> we haven't set up the email server on our site
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> and we've of course run into a couple of things that need it
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> but we're not sure what to use, how secure they will be etc
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> do you have suggestions for us?
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> and slofgren should be doing the discussion on this
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:13 < tyche> It's simple.  Just direct everything that isn't from a regestered user to johnc4510-laptop's account
21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> gaaaaaaaaa
21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> with a re-direct to tyche then
21:13 < xHans> use postfix
21:13 < Jeff_Martin> hehe
21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> cox is killing me today
21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> Jeff_Martin: hey
21:13 < Jeff_Martin> howdy
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> xHans: is that all we need?
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> any security we need to be aware of
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> ?
21:14 -!- [R] [n=rbox@unaffiliated/rbox] has quit ["Leaving"]
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> i'm a rookie on this
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: jump in LOL
21:14 < slofgren> no
21:14 < slofgren> lol
21:14 < xHans> postfix is in good shape
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:14 < slofgren> we just need something that will sent to an smtp server
21:15 < johnc4510-laptop> nods
21:15 < xHans> I suggest using grey-listing
21:15 < slofgren> I prefer to not run that server
21:15 < xHans> you also might want clamav
21:15 < slofgren> ok
21:15 < slofgren> sure
21:15 < Jeff_Martin> exim4 and sendmail
21:15 < xHans> the default postfix setup with debian/Ubuntu is in good shape
21:15 < Jeff_Martin> ?
21:15 < johnc4510-laptop> is grey-listing a type of spam control?
21:15 < slofgren> can we send through godaddy or something
21:15 < xHans> johnc4510-laptop: yes
21:16 < xHans> slofgren: you should be able to, but you're still running a mail server to do it :)
21:16 < johnc4510-laptop> is it CLI or gui interface?
21:16 < xHans> johnc4510-laptop: config files
21:16 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:17 < slofgren> cli
21:17 < slofgren> xHans: yes
21:17 < johnc4510-laptop> well, slofgren what do you think? Should we do this or not?
21:17 < johnc4510-laptop> it would make it much easier to run the registrations on the site
21:18 < xHans> http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/focus_spam_postfix/
21:18 < slofgren> it was really pending on do we need it
21:18 < johnc4510-laptop> it would be automatic then
21:18 < slofgren> if we need it we can do it
21:18 < johnc4510-laptop> if we don't, we have to watch the registrations daily
21:18 < xHans> http://codepoets.co.uk/docs/postfix_spam_reduction_measures
21:18 < johnc4510-laptop> set them up
21:18 < johnc4510-laptop> etc
21:19 < xHans> I suggest putting those two URLs in your config file
21:19 < Jeff_Martin> you just have to make sure relay is set to NO
21:19 < xHans> do you need to receive mail or just send it?
21:19 < slofgren> xHans: ok thanks for your help
21:19 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche: thoughts? kennymc0 ?
21:19 < xHans> slofgren: bitte
21:19 < slofgren> just send
21:19 < slofgren> xHans: lol
21:20 < johnc4510-laptop> xHans: thx, i have somemore to throw at you too
21:20 < xHans> ah, then you just need to configure it such that the sendmail binary will have the right domain, etc.
21:20 < slofgren> I don' think we need to recieve
21:20 < johnc4510-laptop> about hosting for the LUGs and a calendar for all to use
21:20 < slofgren> andthing recieved should go to the group list
21:20 < xHans> the sendmail binary is provided by the mail server package
21:20 < xHans> I still recommend moving to postfix, but the default exim will work fine for that
21:21 < slofgren> ok
21:21 < xHans> mail is easy, anti-spam is a pain
21:21 < slofgren> very true
21:21 < slofgren> but since we are not recieving then that reduces they pain
21:22 < xHans> yup
21:22 < slofgren> we just need to stop relaying
21:22 < slofgren> so we don't get blacklisted
21:22 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:22 < slofgren> azloco.com = viagra spam
21:22 < slofgren> NOOO
21:22 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:23 < kennymc0> that would not be good
21:23 < kennymc0> it would be kinda funny but not good
21:23 < xHans> if you're not accepting you won't be relaying
21:23 < xHans> I still suggest making sure the config has relaying turned off just in case the service gets turned on at some point
21:23 < johnc4510-laptop> ok
21:23 < slofgren> I guess that is true
21:23 < slofgren> agree
21:24 < Jeff_Martin> you do need to accept at first: so that you can tell if the domain (ip block) is grey-listed
21:24 < Jeff_Martin> then lock her up
21:24 < slofgren> nice to hear someone else's input on the topic
21:24 < slofgren> johnc4510-laptop: we can start work on it
21:24 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:25 < johnc4510-laptop> great :)
21:25 < johnc4510-laptop> we need to discuss the filtering thru the mailing list
21:25 < johnc4510-laptop> what did you mean there?
21:25 < slofgren> o.O
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> or maybe i misunderstood
21:26 < slofgren> who are you speaking to?
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> i do that
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> you
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:26 < slofgren> ah
21:26 < slofgren> we don;t need to accept email
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> you said something about the mailing list
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> ah
21:26 < slofgren> through the site we only need to send out
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> ok that works
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> right we do need to send
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:27 < slofgren> yeah the only thing we need to recieve back would worl sending to the list
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> makes sense
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> thx
21:27 < slofgren> other wise don;t worry about it
21:27 < slofgren> ;)
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> right
21:27 < slofgren> lol
21:27 < slofgren> xHans: had good tips
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> yes
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> on the test server, i've installed wordpress to play around with. The idea being to migrate my wordpress blog from their website. http://12.159.65.82/blog   It's a work in progress :)
21:27 < slofgren> we will work on getting it setup
21:28 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:28 < johnc4510-laptop> great
21:28 < xHans> slofgren: ok
21:28 < slofgren> cool
21:28 < johnc4510-laptop> if it works we may install to the main server
21:28 < slofgren> xHans: the "we" did not mean i was throwing you into some work you did not want to do
21:28 < slofgren> ;)
21:29 < slofgren> xHans: I just speak in we and in the team and who ever wanted to help
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> the one thing i found out was that for every wordpress user you need a separate install
21:29 < SlickMcRunfast> that theme blends well with the dust theme
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> SlickMcRunfast: thx
21:29 < slofgren> why not use drupal for blogging
21:30 < xHans> slofgren: no worries, I'm pretty good at not doing work I didn't volunteer for :)
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> we could and may, i wanted to try wordpress since tyche and i both have wordpress accts
21:30 < slofgren> xHans: haha
21:30 < scott_ev> johnc4510-laptop: that sounds like complicating the system
21:30 < tyche> I'm not sure I want to go through the pain of going through BZR again.
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> scott_ev: yes it might
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche: yeah i know.
21:31 < slofgren> johnc4510-laptop: still it was worth playing with
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> i wanted to learn wordpress too, so if no one else wants to use it
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> that's ok
21:31 < slofgren> that si what the test server it for
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> right
21:32 < kennymc0> test server ftw
21:32 < slofgren> johnc4510-laptop: how much system resources does it use
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> i did learn that install with subversion makes it easy, and makes for easy upgrades
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> i haven't checked yet
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> i wouldn't think much but...
21:32 < Jeff_Martin> johnc4510-laptop: http://mu.bloggles.info/
21:32 < slofgren> johnc4510-laptop: so did you install subversion too
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> we'll have to check on that
21:32 < Jeff_Martin> Wordpress Multi-User plugin
21:32 < Jeff_Martin> ;)
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: yes on installing subversion
21:33 < slofgren> cool
21:33 < scott_ev> nice
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> Jeff_Martin: oh great, what i read was wrong then
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:33 < slofgren> lol
21:33 < Jeff_Martin> I knew I had seen it on smashingapps
21:33 < Jeff_Martin> but I don't use wordpress
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> after i set up the database in mysql, there were like 3 commands to get wordpress installed
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> then one config file to edit
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> and that was it
21:34 < slofgren> cool
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> yeah, it was easy
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> ok
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> do we want to talk about hosting for lugs, and a state events calendar?
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> i know slofgren is already hosting luna i think??
21:35 < slofgren> sure
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: is that right
21:35 < slofgren> yes we are
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> link?
21:35 < slofgren> lugy.net is on the azloco.com server
21:35 < Jeff_Martin> http://mu.wordpress.org/
21:36 < scott_ev> www.lugy.net
21:36 < johnc4510-laptop> nice
21:36 < slofgren> notice top line
21:36 < slofgren> lol
21:36 < johnc4510-laptop> so slofgren is that going to be the way we host for all?
21:37 < slofgren> what way?
21:37 < slofgren> i think we can offer space
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> and the last line toooo!!!
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> hosted by AZ
21:37 < slofgren> lol
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, what i was asking was if all will be virtually hosted?
21:37 < slofgren> they can use the tech we have installed
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> nice, so how does that work?
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> rookie here
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:38 < slofgren> we will use a virtualhost via apache but not a virtual machine
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> nice
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> now, how are we going to let the lugs know?
21:39 < slofgren> it take setting up a new available site in apache and restarting apache
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> ah
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:39 < slofgren> through personal interaction
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:39 < slofgren> I think each of us should be attending our local lug meetings
21:39 < slofgren> like kennymc0 did
21:39 < slofgren> for Plug
21:39 < slofgren> and i do for Lugy
21:39 < slofgren> and used to do with luna
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> i'm sure groups like plug and devry don't need us, but sierra vista might
21:40 < scott_ev> i'm meeting truesday with a local luug
21:40 < slofgren> yeah
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> agreed
21:40 < slofgren> but they all might enjoy sharing a calendar
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> yes
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, on that point
21:40 < xHans> can you setup mailing lists for them as well?
21:40 < slofgren> brb...kid issue
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:40 < xHans> scott_ev: in Mesa?
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> was just about to hand that to slofgren
21:41 < scott_ev> yes
21:41 < johnc4510-laptop> xHans: i dont want to commit to that yet but in the future maybe
21:41 < xHans> svlug or something like that?
21:41 < johnc4510-laptop> i want us to see how that goes
21:41 < slofgren> we could
21:41 < johnc4510-laptop> since i'm a rookie
21:41 < slofgren> but do we want to
21:41 < johnc4510-laptop> ah
21:41 < scott_ev> xHans: some of the plug guys meet with some reitred guys at sunland village
21:41 < slofgren> I don;t think we want to be their whole services world but a help
21:42 < scott_ev> xHans: exactly
21:42 < slofgren> we don;t unlimited resources here
21:42 < scott_ev> larry, erik, I forget all the names
21:42 < slofgren> the fact is we have some nice equipment and ocnnections but they are now brand new
21:42 -!- lincoln321 [n=lincoln3@ip24-251-94-70.ph.ph.cox.net] has joined #ubuntu-us-az
21:42 < slofgren> and would be hard to replace
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> right
21:43 < slofgren> s/now/not
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> slow and easy still
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> i think
21:43 < slofgren> brb
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> that doesn't mean no, but we'll see
21:44 < johnc4510-laptop> the virtual hosting is a good start and we can work into the other in time maybe
21:44 < slofgren> ok
21:44 < johnc4510-laptop> ??
21:44 < slofgren> I think our main goals with the lugs is to just be helpful
21:44 < xHans> scott_ev: cool, please help make sure news gets back and forth between svlug and plug :)
21:44 < johnc4510-laptop> of course xHans is free to tell any lug he meets up with that we are offering virtual host if they want it
21:44 < slofgren> encourage them ultimatly have their own services
21:44 < slofgren> and push ubuntu
21:44 < scott_ev> xHans: will do
21:44 < xHans> danke
21:45 < scott_ev> bitte
21:45 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, the calendar then
21:45 < slofgren> an we need to make sure to attend fine lugs like plug
21:45 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: should we set that up as a sub-domain of ours?
21:45 < johnc4510-laptop> agreed
21:45 < slofgren> johnc4510-laptop: probably
21:46 < slofgren> cal.azloco.com
21:46 < johnc4510-laptop> can we run it off the drupal install too?
21:46 < xHans> johnc4510-laptop: yup
21:46 < johnc4510-laptop> cool
21:46 < slofgren> I am not sure how it will all work
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> on access then
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> two lug contacts have access?
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> or what?
21:47 < slofgren> per host
21:47 < slofgren> yeah
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> two from each lug
21:47 < slofgren> that seems fine
21:48 < johnc4510-laptop> that way they have a second in case of vacations, sickness, etc
21:48 < slofgren> I think it can be a case by case issues but in general just two
21:48 < slofgren> agree
21:48 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:48 < slofgren> I don;t want to over stay our welcome with the nice connection

21:51 < johnc4510-laptop> i encourage the team to start using the test server
21:51 < johnc4510-laptop> ah
