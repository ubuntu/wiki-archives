__TOC__

Well, I know there is a planned Face Browser for GDM, but I think, the default, replacing the one in 8.04 should be the theme found http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Ubuntu+Professional?content=81130 <-- Here. It looks very glossy, and it is an eye-opener. It looks much nicer than the current theme.
