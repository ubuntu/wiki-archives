== Tango, Flow, and Glossy ==

<nowiki>[[File:Tango,_Flow_and_Glossy_small.png]]</nowiki>

An Ubuntu theme that is...

=== Simple ===
No radically different UI ideas.

=== Distinct ===
Distinct from other OS themes, while being elegant and clean.

=== In Keeping With Ubuntu ===
Using the same color palette of warm oranges and reds.

=== Uses Open Source and Creative Commons ===

The theme uses existing Open Source and CC elements that are finished as of this date. Specifically:
* Tango (tangerine more specifically), an Open Source icon set <nowiki>[[http://tango.freedesktop.org]]</nowiki>
* Glossy, a popular icon theme included in GNOME <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome.org]]</nowiki>
* Fl33, one of the Flow series of Creative Commons artworks by D Garcia <nowiki>[[http://d-garcia.deviantart.com/art/fl33-1600x1200-51625927]]</nowiki>
* Setting default Nautilus icon size to 150%. Larger icons are a feature of most modern desktop OSs and Tango's icons look fine in this resolution.

=== Achievable by the Feature Freeze ===

This you see above is an actual working desktop, using two existing Ubuntu themes plus the CC artwork. To do list is very small.

==== To Do ====

Things required to finish:
* Add shadows to desktop icon text to improve readability
* A login theme using the same wallpaper and fitting in with Glossy
