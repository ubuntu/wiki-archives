21:39 < tyche> duanedesign: And feel free  to ask lots of questions.  We don't have anything to hide.  Besides johnc4510, that is.  Oh, and Shane. Hee hee
21:39 -!- [R] [n=rbox@unaffiliated/rbox] has quit ["Leaving"]
21:39 < johnc4510> and everyone is going to pitch in on the jaunty planning page :)

21:40 < johnc4510> tyche: lol
21:40 < duanedesign> well we all have our skeletons in our closets
21:40 < johnc4510> scott_ev: sure
21:40 < johnc4510> everyone hang on
21:40 < johnc4510> please
21:40 < xHans> Adler_: http://www.LuftHans.com/Stammtisch
21:40 < Adler_> I thought hast we had a secret German agent going on here.
21:40 < johnc4510> i forgot, scott_ev wants to go over bug triage
21:40 < johnc4510> sorry scott_ev
21:40 < tyche> Adler_: Oh, there's nothing secret about xHans
21:40 < johnc4510> go for it
21:40 < johnc4510> :)
21:40 < scott_ev> lately we have mentioned getting the team involved in bur triaging, etc.
21:40 < johnc4510> yep
21:41 < scott_ev> so, johnc4510 asked me to put together a blog outlining the procedures
21:41 < scott_ev> it can be found at http://azloco.com/node/64
21:41 < xHans> well, I am the Ubuntu/debian mole in PLUG :)
21:41 < johnc4510> lol
21:41 -!- Jeff_Martin [n=jeff@cm-24-121-46-215.kingman.az.npgco.com] has quit [Connection timed out]
21:41 < Jeff_Martin2> hmm
21:42 < scott_ev> the thing is that QA is or can be as important to the longevity and well-being of an OS as just about anything
21:42 -!- Jeff_Martin2 is now known as Jeff_Martin
21:42 < johnc4510> right scott_ev
21:42 < scott_ev> to get involved you don't need to be a power user or a developer.  there are things that anyone with any skill set can do
21:43 < johnc4510> k
21:43 < tyche> johnc4510: Give the man a chance to type.  We can teach him "cut-and-paste" later.
21:43 < johnc4510> k
21:43 < johnc4510> :)
21:43 < tyche> Go ahead, scott_ev.  Don't let johnc4510 pressure you.
21:43 < Jeff_Martin> excellent scott_ev
21:43 < tyche> You're doing fine.
21:43 < johnc4510> yep
21:44 < scott_ev> remember too, for hose of you that may want to puruse Ubuntu membership, that launchpad karma is as important as team stuff
21:44 < scott_ev> done
21:44 < johnc4510> nods
21:44 < johnc4510> ok i have some questions
21:44 < johnc4510> first
21:44 < tyche> Very good.  Got a link for your blog?
21:44 < scott_ev> http://azloco.com/node/64
21:44 < tyche> Great.  That'll go in the Team newsletter.
21:45 < johnc4510> i eventually would like to get the team working on bugs for hug day to be on the team bug reporting stats
21:45 < johnc4510> but
21:45 < scott_ev> if you start with the link to bug triaging, it will take you everywhere else you need to go
21:45 < johnc4510> i think we need to work on some individual bugs first
21:45 < johnc4510> to get our feet wet
21:45 < johnc4510> so to speak
21:45 < scott_ev> true, and as a team, we can get involved in 5-a-day stuff
21:45 < johnc4510> great
21:45 < johnc4510> right
21:46 < johnc4510> ok, so, i'd like to spend some time with you one on one to make sure i'm learning correctly
21:46 < Adler_> How is that Wordpress Blog going?

21:46 < duanedesign> I have been triaging for the last 3 or 4 months. I really enjoy it

21:47 < johnc4510> but we're waiting on shane for some final thinkgs
21:47 < scott_ev> duanedesign: sweet
21:47 < johnc4510> duanedesign: great
21:47 < xHans> johnc4510: schedule a presentation on bug triaging for a PLUG meeting and then come visit :)

21:48 < duanedesign> I managed to get our team 4th in the last global bug jam. Granted it was alot of "low hanging fruit" but they are all important
