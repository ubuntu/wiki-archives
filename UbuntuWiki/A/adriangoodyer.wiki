=== About Me ===

Hello everyone. My name is Ade and I reside in the UK.

I am currently working full-time whilst studying towards a Bsc in Computing and IT: Software Development and previously have a background in web development. I would describe myself best as an intermediate Java programmer, but I also have various transferable skills from mathematics, project management and general repairing/maintaining of computer hardware.

I am approachable, friendly and will always endeavour to help others. I have been using Ubuntu on and off for nearly two years now and what I like about it most is that it's free and maintained by a fantastic community of people who's knowledge and willingness to help one another never ceases to amaze me.

'''Currently skilled in:'''
Java SE 6 + 7, HTML, CSS, XML, Javascript and Apache

'''Have a little experience with:'''
BASH scripting, MYSQL, HTML5, C# and Visual Basic

'''Would like to learn next...'''
More design patterns in Java, Android development, Python, QML and PHP5

Many thanks to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/phillw | phillw]]</nowiki> for setting up the template of this wiki for me.

=== My Involvement with the Ubuntu Community ===

As a QA tester and member of the QA testing team, my main focus at the moment is the downloading and testing of the daily .iso builds for Ubuntu. This involves downloading the current build and performing test-cases each day to make sure still they function as their specification describes and reporting bugs as and when is necessary.

==== QA and Testing ====

The <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam | Ubuntu QA Team]]</nowiki> is responsible for ensuring that every release of the entire ubuntu family gets better and better. Each flavour of the ubuntu family has their own QA / Testing team. We always need, on all flavours, more people to join and help. '''#ubuntu-quality''' on irc.freenode.net

==== Ubuntu Beginners Team ====

The <nowiki>[[ https:--wiki.ubuntu.com-BeginnersTeam | Ubuntu Beginners Team]]</nowiki> exists to enhance the initial experience of new Ubuntu users and to guide existing Ubuntu users to become part of the global Ubuntu community. We have many Focus Groups involved in different parts of the community. '''#ubuntu-beginners''' on irc.freenode.net

==== Ubuntu-UK Team ====

The <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UKTeam/ | UK Local Community Team]]</nowiki> aims to provide free community support to users of the various flavours of Ubuntu as well as advocating the use of Ubuntu to individuals and organisations alike. This group is for anyone in the United Kingdom (but we welcome non-UK residents) who uses or is interested in some flavour of Ubuntu, whether it's Ubuntu, Kubuntu or any others. This group is for people of all technical abilities from I've-never-heard-of-linux all the way to I'm-an-Ubuntu-Master. '''#ubuntu-uk''' on irc.freenode.net

==== BugSquad ====

The <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BugSquad | Bug Squad]]</nowiki> is the first point of contact for the bugs filed about Ubuntu. Members assign bugs to packages, ensure that bug reports are complete, find duplicate bug reports, recreate bugs, and forward bugs to their upstream authors. All of these activities help bugs get fixed and subsequently make Ubuntu even better. '''#ubuntu-bugs''' on irc.freenode.net

==== 5-a-day Team ====

Put simply, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/5-A-Day | 5-a-day]]</nowiki> is a great approach to making our list of bugs more manageable by sharing the workload. This is inspired by the philosophy that eating 5 portions of fruit/vegetables keeps you healthy...well, working on 5 bugs a day keeps Ubuntu healthy.

=== Development & Goals ===

At this moment in time I am focusing all my effort on becoming more comfortable with QA testing, getting more involved in that role and improving the quality of the bugs I report.

Within the Ubuntu realm, I would like to join the bug team next and then progress eventually into development. This is so I can see the full spectrum from how a bug initially comes about, is then triaged and finally how it gets debugged/solved so a fix can be committed.

Personally, I would like to complete my degree and find employment within the software development industry. In the mean time I would like to continue to involve myself with fantastic open-source projects and perhaps start a few of my own.

=== Personal Achievements ===
At my current workplace we are encouraged to keep a 'boast sheet' that documents our working achievements, no matter how small. This can be later used when writing work appraisals and for our personal development, it works well and so here I write what I have achieved so far..
