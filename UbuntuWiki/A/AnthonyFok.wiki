=== About me ===

Debian Developer since 1997, initially packaging software related to music typesetting and Chinese i18n/L10n.

Worked at ThizLinux full-time from 2001 to 2010, and part-time until 2014.  My work over the years included:
* Chinese related i18n/L10n issues, e.g. contribution of GB18030 codec to Qt in 2002.
* Hardware enablement for notebooks and desktops
* Embedded Linux on ARM and MIPS based netbooks and set-top boxes.
