[Sun Aug 3 2008] [21:37:44] <xHans>	it's a great opportunity to get an OOo class in, so we need to fill it. failing to fill it will likely mean it'll be years before we can try it again

[Sun Aug 3 2008] [21:38:09] <xHans>	maybe ask on the TFUG list if anyone knows of companies using OOo internally
