Hi Folks,
        My name is Ashish. I live in Bangalore, South India. I have been using Ubuntu from October 2005. I have tried a lot of distributions. I have tried out Fedora and also Open Suse, but nothing like Ubuntu. I had to grab a laptop from the store and tried installing right from Redhat. Redhat was poor and Kuduzu did'nt even detect my Intel BG 2200 Card. Open Suse to had it's own problems, the resolution was not perfect. Surprise when I installed Ubuntu Breezy Badger it detected all the devices perfectly. It's the most amazing distro I have ever used. It's indeed "humanity to others". I will be a faithful user of Ubuntu and will contrubute in many ways as much as possible.

:)
