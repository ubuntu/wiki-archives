=== About Me ===

I'm currently in my first year of six form and enjoy programming in python and php in my spare time. I am wishing to improve this skill by studying how other software works. I am also taking my Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award.  

=== Contributions ===

I have recently started to triage bugs and are interested in commonly used programs such as Firefox, Evolution etc. I am available Monday to Friday 1700 - 2100 GMT.
