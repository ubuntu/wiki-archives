To get wireless working you will need to copy the firmware over from Android. Boot into Ubuntu and issue in Terminal or in adb shell:

<pre>
mkdir -p /media/Android
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/Android
cp /media/Android/vendor/firmware/fw_bcm4329.bin /lib/firmware/
cp /media/Android/etc/nvram.txt /lib/firmware/
</pre>

Reboot. Now wireless should get up
