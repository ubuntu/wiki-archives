* Save the planet!

    Melissa put out a request for people interested in having their blogs added to http://planet.ubuntu.org.au/.

    Publicity of the planet came up as something to work on.

* Calendar

    It was decided to go with the http://ubuntu.org.au calendar as 'master' for several reasons. These were Centralising all Ubuntu-Australia resources, and support for exporting to iCal. The calendar needs the meeting time and date added

    Action:    Fujitsu to add the meeting date to the calendar.

== Agenda ==

*** Save the planet!
****** It is a little-known fact that we have a <nowiki>[[http://planet.ubuntu.org.au/|planet]]</nowiki>. Planet Ubuntu-Au is not publicised anywhere, and consequently only has two members and few visitors. I have added a link to the Australian Team wiki page, but we should at least have another link on the main <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.org.au|ubuntu.org.au]]</nowiki> page. I was thinking of having one as a tab in the top-right corner. - Sridhar Dhanapalan (yama)

*** Calendar
****** Following the recent happenings regarding an Ubuntu-Au calendar, how about we make a decision as to which calendar will be the 'official' one. (Google, the Fridge, or Ubuntu-Au) - <nowiki>[[Melmazzone]]</nowiki> (Melchiorre)
