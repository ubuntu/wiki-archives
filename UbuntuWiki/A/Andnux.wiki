=== Introduction ===
Windows and macOS are very big operating systems. Ubuntu is not known at all compared to them. So that's what we want, spread awareness! Android and iOS are also quite popular. We need a phone operating system. The developers need to work on it, based on Android, and it has to be Google-free!

=== Roles ===
We need-
1. Content Manager
2. Developers
3. Tester
4. Hosting Manager
5. Designers
