== Application Review Request ==

Submit your application review request to the <nowiki>[[https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/|developer portal]]</nowiki>.

 1. Click "Submit a new application"
 2. Log in using your Launchpad email/password.
 3. On the "Submit your application" page, set the application name, tagline, version number, and package name. For the price, select "Free". For "Your application", upload a simple text file named ''ppa-info.txt'' that includes the URL of the PPA, and of your source code (bzr/git/svn/other). '''Don't upload any package files or source files.''' Click "Next: Finding Your App".
 4. On the "Finding your app" page, pick a category for your app, enter a description, and some keywords that might help users searching for your app. If your app requires any special hardware, check the relevant "Hardware requirements" options. Click "Next: Visuals".
 5. On the "Showing your app" page, upload your app icons and a screenshot. We use these in the Software Center, and need at least a 64x64 png icon and a screenshot with your submission (even if you already have those files included in your package). The video is completely optional. Click "Next: Licensing & support".
 6. On the "Licensing & support" page, enter a website or email address where users can go for help. Select the open source license for you app. Click "Next: Preview & submit".
 7. On the "Preview & submit" page, review the details and make sure they're correct. Click "Submit for review".
