== Ubuntu-AU Local Meetings ==

In <nowiki>[[AustralianTeam-Brisbane|Brisbane]]</nowiki>, we've been having social gatherings on a quarterly basis.  <nowiki>[[PaulGear|I'm]]</nowiki> proposing that we hold technical gatherings monthly in the two months between each quarterly social gathering.

Here are the current suggestions about what the meetings would look like:
* Location:
** family-friendly venue (i.e. not a pub, fully non-smoking venue)
** convenient location (central, or perhaps rotating through different regions)
** free parking
** close to public transport
** easy access to coffee/food (or at least facilities to prepare such)
** free/very cheap wireless Internet access
** preferably a local Ubuntu mirror
* Activities:
** install-fests
** <nowiki>[[AustralianTeam-Projects-BugJams|BugJams]]</nowiki>
** share problems or challenges and try to solve them together
** informal technical talks about things we're working on
** accessible to all levels of technical expertise (i.e. newbie friendly)
** open to potential Ubuntu users as well as actual Ubuntu users
** log our actions on IRC and/or wiki
