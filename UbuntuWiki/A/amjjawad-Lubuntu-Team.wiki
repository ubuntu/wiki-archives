== Full History ==

The Full History of my involvement, contributions and activities with Lubuntu Team. I have joined Lubuntu Team in 25-8-2011 and I have resigned in 7-7-2013 from all <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/amjjawad/Lubuntu-Team#Roles | my roles mentioned above]]</nowiki> except for Lubuntu Brainstorming Team. Two years, full of achievements and activities. Some of you may not know the fact that I was working with Lubuntu on volunteer basis but FULL TIME. Sometimes, I had to work almost daily from 10 hours - 16 hours. I was almost available online all the time except for the few hours I was sleeping in. Lubuntu was more than just a system. It is like my second home. Was in my heart and will forever be.

=== My Projects with Lubuntu Team ===

After two years with Lubuntu, from being a new beginner user who just started to use Linux for the very first time in his life to a Team Leader in a great and interesting project called <nowiki>[[Lubuntu]]</nowiki>; I have gained all the required skills and learned the needed experience to create projects and lead them as well. I've reached to my golden era with Lubuntu because sub-projects within the main project, IMHO, will make the main project stronger and much powerful.

==== WOW Lubuntu ====
{{http://i47.tinypic.com/2u7c96t.jpg}}
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/CommunicationsTeam/WOWLubuntu | WOW Lubuntu]]</nowiki> is a project created by myself to enlighten the whole world with the power of Linux generally and Lubuntu specifically and tell the untold story about a unique system that could breathe a new life into an ancient machine instead of breathing the dust somewhere in the dark.

==== Lubuntu 101 ====
From WOW Lubuntu, the inspiration to create more projects became stronger. Hence, another projects were born from WOW Lubuntu :)
Lubuntu 101 will focus on 3 types of people/users:

1. Beginners  to Lubuntu.

1. Newcomers to Linux, those who never heard about Lubuntu nor tried it yet.

1. Windows Users.
More details about Lubuntu 101 will be <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/SupportTeam/Lubuntu101 | here]]</nowiki>

==== Start Ubuntu ====

{{https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StartUbuntu?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=rocket_banner_900x256.png}}

'''This is by far, my biggest project and the most important one ever'''. 
Start Ubuntu is a huge project and a massive campaign that is aiming to reach to Microsoft Windows XP Users and offering them a modern, unique, stable, fast, powerful, highly customizable, active and amazing community based system, open-source, free Linux System which should replace their very old no longer supported system. Start Ubuntu is simply offering NOT ONLY one replacing for Windows XP, it is offering 8 options, 8 alternatives, 8 Operating Systems.
