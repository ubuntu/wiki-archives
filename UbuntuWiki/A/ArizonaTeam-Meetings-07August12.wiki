21:21< johnc4510> he said that they were suppose to install the cdrom this wk
21:21< johnc4510> i'm assuming that since he is not here
21:21< johnc4510> it either didn't get down
21:21< johnc4510> or didn't work
21:22< ianmcorvidae> Hehe.

21:27< donchriscoe> Ok I can do this.
21:27< johnc4510> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline/Resources.
21:28< johnc4510> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline
21:28< johnc4510> then you can decide what you would like to help with
21:28< johnc4510> ty
21:28< johnc4510> ianmcorvidae: that's all from me
21:28-!- br24 [n=bribri12@ip68-231-131-152.tc.ph.cox.net] has quit [Connection timed out]
21:28< johnc4510> he did fall asleep
21:28< johnc4510> hee hee
21:29< ianmcorvidae> lol
21:29< ianmcorvidae> Sorry.
21:29< johnc4510> np
21:29< ianmcorvidae> Ok, well then.
21:29< ianmcorvidae> Case badges: john, you start.
21:29< johnc4510> Case Badges: The MassachusettsTeam is getting together an order for case badges. You can find the images here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MassachusettsTeam/Projects/AluminiumCaseBadges  Toward the bottom of the page is a breakdown of costs.
21:29< ianmcorvidae> And everyone else, you'll have to wake up for this :P
21:29< johnc4510> yes
21:29< shaanM> im awake!
21:30< johnc4510> As it stands now, if they get another 1000 commitments, we can get them for $0.62 each plus a $15 setup and postage fee. If they get commitments for another 2500, we could get them for $0.34 each plus set up and postage.
21:30< johnc4510> .
21:30< johnc4510> So, we need to decide if we want them, how we are going to pay for them, and how many we want.
21:30< johnc4510> we'll give you a minute or so to look it over
21:31< jsonder> it just doesn't fit  see:  http://members.cox.net/so4plume/1.jpg
21:31< johnc4510> ah  nice
21:31< johnc4510> lol
21:32< ianmcorvidae> lol
21:32< johnc4510> jsonder: we'll get you one for your noggin
21:32< johnc4510> hee hee
21:32< indigoshift> ha
21:32< johnc4510> ok, everyone had a chance to look it over
21:32< johnc4510> ?
21:32< ianmcorvidae> I have, naturally.
21:32< indigoshift> yup
21:33< johnc4510> ok
21:33< shaanM> yup
21:33< ianmcorvidae> I'd personally say 100 flat; we have plenty of members who may want them on 1+ computers, and then we'll also be doing events.
21:33< johnc4510> are we interest in this  +1 for yes  -1 for no
21:33< johnc4510> +1
21:33< ianmcorvidae> +1
21:33< indigoshift> +1
21:33< donchriscoe> +1
21:33< shaanM> +1
21:34< johnc4510> ok
21:34< jsonder> -1
21:34< johnc4510> np
21:34< johnc4510> ok
21:34< johnc4510> how many do we want
21:34< johnc4510> ianmcorvidae: ?
21:34< fredburger> ianmcorvidae: is it one design or the other or what
21:34< ianmcorvidae> Everyone, ignore fred.
21:34< ianmcorvidae> He's a bot.
21:35< johnc4510> yep
21:35< johnc4510> but
21:35< jsonder> If you do this, can I vote for the black base?
21:35< johnc4510> they haven't decided which one yet
21:35< ianmcorvidae> jsonder: May I ask why the no vote?
21:35< johnc4510> i don't think
21:35< ianmcorvidae> I figure we should have the chance to air opinions :)
21:35< johnc4510> k
21:35< jsonder> I can think of more useful places to put ~$500
21:35< jsonder> like cds
21:36< jsonder> demos
21:36< johnc4510> true
21:36< jsonder> etc
21:36< johnc4510> although i doubt if we spend that much
21:36< t00na> hello
21:36< t00na> there are a lot of people here...
21:36< ianmcorvidae> Well, the thing is, with their current number of orders, 100 would be something like 30 bucks plus the 15 dollar setup fee.
21:36< johnc4510> this is more of an extra   if you want to do it ok if not ok
21:37< ianmcorvidae> t00na: We're in the middle of a meeting - there should be :P
21:37< johnc4510> t00na: hi
21:37< t00na> oh, wrong channel...
21:37< jsonder> OK, not a problem then
21:37< johnc4510> ianmcorvidae: how many do you think
21:38< ianmcorvidae> I'd personally say we get 100 at least.
21:38< johnc4510> k
21:38< johnc4510> anyone else
21:38< ianmcorvidae> Since, that would cost us .34*100+15=49 dollars.
21:38< indigoshift> I could definitely use...5
21:38< indigoshift> ;)
21:38< ianmcorvidae> Which isn't exactly much.
21:38< ianmcorvidae> :P
21:38< SloggerKhan> I could use 2, I gues.
21:38< SloggerKhan> *guess
21:38< johnc4510> SloggerKhan: hi
21:39< johnc4510> ok
21:39< donchriscoe> I would get 4.
21:39< johnc4510> hmm
21:39< SloggerKhan> (Does PMing you not work, John?)
21:39< jsonder> I'd want one for my mac mini
21:39< ianmcorvidae> SloggerKhan: You have to register and identify to send PM's on Freenode
21:39< johnc4510> SloggerKhan: i didn't get it
21:40-!- Vorian [n=Steve@ubuntu/member/pdpc.supporter.active.Vorian] has quit []
21:40< johnc4510> ok
21:40-!- Vorian [n=Steve@ubuntu/member/pdpc.supporter.active.Vorian] has joined #ubuntu-arizona
21:40< johnc4510> 100 cost $77
21:40< ianmcorvidae> Um, no.
21:40< johnc4510> if my math is correct
21:41< ianmcorvidae> They're at the 2500 level already, john.
21:41< indigoshift> Right on.  I'll take ten! :D
21:41< johnc4510> ah
21:41< ianmcorvidae> lol
21:41< SloggerKhan> ( ianmcorvidae: link to registration? )
21:41< johnc4510> then $49
21:41< ianmcorvidae> SloggerKhan: /msg nickserv help
21:41< ianmcorvidae> You can PM him.
21:41< ianmcorvidae>  /it, as nickserv's a bot
21:41< ianmcorvidae> Yep.
21:42< johnc4510> i'll chip in $25
21:42< johnc4510> that's half
21:42< ianmcorvidae> Ok, so, here's my thinking on this: We're an advocacy team - we'll want to have these not only for ourselves, but as an advocacy 'goodie,' in all likelihood.
21:42< ianmcorvidae> And, of course, for additional members.
21:42-!- Vorian [n=Steve@ubuntu/member/pdpc.supporter.active.Vorian] has quit [Client Quit]
21:42< johnc4510> right
21:43< jsonder> ianmcorvidae: so go big and get 300?
21:43< ianmcorvidae> jsonder: We could do that, yeah; wanted to get approval from other folks :)
21:43< jsonder> I'll chip in too
21:43< shaanM> im getting very confused. What are we talking about again. Sorry i dont mean to be rude!
21:44< jsonder> computer case badges
21:44< ianmcorvidae> shaanM: Did you see the link about case badges? We're discussing how many/if we want to get them.
21:44< ianmcorvidae> Sorry.
21:44< ianmcorvidae> I'll certainly be chipping in :)
21:44< SloggerKhan> I can chip in.
21:44< ianmcorvidae> Might I suggest that any *members* that want badges can pay for their own personal ones themselves; the rest we can deal with by chipping in as we are?
21:45< SloggerKhan> I can do $10, $20 for extras.
21:45< ianmcorvidae> Just as a start.
21:45< ianmcorvidae> I'd be up for at least 20 to chip in.
21:45< johnc4510> SloggerKhan: thanks
21:45< jsonder> I'll match john
21:45< johnc4510> jsonder: thanks
21:45< johnc4510> appreciate it
21:45< ianmcorvidae> Ok; that brings us to 80, I believe.
21:45< donchriscoe> I throw in $15.
21:45< indigoshift> I'll pitch in $20
21:46< shaanM> Sorry dont expect me to pay anything I am only a kid and I know my parent will say no! I am not trying to be rude or anything
21:46< johnc4510> i think we're at   at least 200 badges
21:46< ianmcorvidae> shaanM: Don't worry about it :)
21:46< johnc4510> ianmcorvidae: is that right
21:46< ianmcorvidae> I'm calculating, one sec.
21:46< johnc4510> shaanM: don't worry about it
21:46< johnc4510> np
21:46< johnc4510> :)
21:46< jsonder> shaanM: you being here is a gift enough!
21:46< johnc4510> true
21:46< shaanM> thank you
21:46< ianmcorvidae> Almost 300, actually.
21:46< johnc4510> cool
21:47< ianmcorvidae> That's 115 dollars; I'll donate the extra two to get us to 300 badges.
21:47< johnc4510> how much more $ to 300
21:47< ianmcorvidae> two dollars, that I just donated :P
21:47< johnc4510> cool
21:47< johnc4510> ty
21:47< johnc4510> ok
21:47< ianmcorvidae> Ok. So, I'll put us on the page for 300, at least for the time being.
21:47< johnc4510> we will set up some way to collect the money and email everyone
21:47< jsonder> the unmarked bills go where?
21:47< donchriscoe> How do we get the monies to you?
21:48< ianmcorvidae> I think for now we wait.
21:48< johnc4510> jsonder: to me
21:48< johnc4510> :)
21:48< ianmcorvidae> Heh, yeah.
21:48< johnc4510> donchriscoe: we will set it up and let you know
21:48< johnc4510> ok
21:48< indigoshift> waiting's good...it'll give me time to get the bills cut properly. ;)
21:48< donchriscoe> ok
21:48< ianmcorvidae> Actually, I'll put us on the page for $117, whatever that may be at various cost levels.
21:48< johnc4510> hee
21:48< ianmcorvidae> Sound good?
21:48< johnc4510> indigoshift: i'm watching you  LOL
21:49< johnc4510> thanks guys   this is a good deal
21:49< indigoshift> nobody watches someone who counterfeits one-dollar bills.  ;)
21:49< SloggerKhan> I can give $3 to make it 120, which is a nicer sounding number.
21:49< johnc4510> i think
21:49< johnc4510> ok
21:49< johnc4510> ianmcorvidae: anything else?
21:49< ianmcorvidae> Agenda for next week.
21:49< ianmcorvidae> I think that's all
