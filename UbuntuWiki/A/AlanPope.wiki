=== About Me ===

I'm a 50-something married father of two living in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnborough%2C_Hampshire|Farnborough]]</nowiki>,  <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire|Hampshire]]</nowiki> in the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK|UK]]</nowiki>. I've been using Linux on the desktop since about 2002 or so and run a mix of Ubuntu desktops, laptops & servers and other odd devices. I'm a Developer Advocate for Telegraf at InfluxData. I previously worked as a Developer Advocate and Community Manager in Ubuntu Engineering Services for Canonical and actively helped out with my LoCo Team in the UK.

I installed Ubuntu when version 4.10 (Warty Warthog) was released and now have a mixture of real and virtual machines running various releases.

=== Things I do for Ubuntu ===

* Started the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntupodcast.org|Ubuntu Podcast]]</nowiki> and continue to co-present, mirror, co-produce and co-manage the show along with a few other members of the <nowiki>[[UKTeam|UK LoCo Team]]</nowiki>. We have interviewed numerous key people in the Ubuntu project have around 3,000 core subscribers with each episode downloaded about 10,000 times. We recently hit 1.4 million downloads which is quite an achievement for a niche podcast.
* Sponsored myself to attend <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-Sevilla|Ubuntu Developer Summit in Sevilla]]</nowiki> in 2007.
* Gained Canonical sponsorship to attend four more subsequent Ubuntu Developer Summits.
* Setup and ran the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-screencasts|Screencast Team]]</nowiki> which aimed to create a set of tutorial videos for new Ubuntu users.

* Often run development releases of Ubuntu early in the cycle to provide testing, bug reporting and triage help.
* I have run a couple of sessions during past Ubuntu Open Weeks in #ubuntu-classroom.
* I've previously did a bit of packaging for <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~tomboy-packagers||Tomboy]]</nowiki> which has been entertaining/enjoyable/educational in roughly equal amounts.

==== Support ====

* I have helped out with <nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+questions|Support]]</nowiki> tickets in the past, and more recently with <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/people/popey/+subscribedbugs|bugs]]</nowiki>.

* I also answer some questions on <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/|AskUbuntu]]</nowiki> and vote up/down stuff that looks sane/insane
