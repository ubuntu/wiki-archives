Setting Up Test Cases for the Touchpad:

Testing Features: (The Features of xserver-xorg-input-synaptics package)

** Movement with adjustable, non-linear acceleration and speed.

** Button events through short touching of the touchpad.

** Double-Button events through double short touching of the touchpad.

** Dragging through short touching and holding down the finger on  the touchpad (tap-and-drag gesture).

** Middle and right button events on the upper and lower corner of the touchpad.

** Vertical scrolling (button four and five events) through moving the finger on the right side of the touchpad.

** The up/down button sends button four/five events.

** Horizontal  scrolling  (button six and seven events) through moving the finger on the lower side of the touchpad.

** The  multi-buttons  send  button  four/five  events  for   vertical scrolling and button six/seven events for horizontal scrolling.

** Adjustable finger detection.

** Multifinger  taps: two finger for right button and three finger for middle button events.  (Needs hardware  support.   Not all models implement this feature.)
** Pressure dependent motion speed.
** Run-time  configuration  using  shared  memory.  This means you can change parameter settings without restarting the X server.

       Note that depending on the touchpad firmware, some  of  these  features
       might  be  available even without using the synaptics driver. Note also
       that some functions are not available on all touchpad  models,  because
       they  need  support  from  the touchpad hardware/firmware. (Multifinger
       taps for example.)
