I vote for nuovext - brickbat
=== Tango (submitted by Viper550) ===

Come on, Tango is included with Ubuntu, and it is primaraly Blue so it would be perfect! :D

* I vote for Tango too ( PingunZ )

=== HumanAzul ===

* I suggest using HumanAzul, which is a blue version of Dapper's standard Human theme. It's already fairly complete too. And no, I didn't make this, someone on Gnome-Look.org named Sympozium did ;) -Derick_eisenhardt 

''Thanks - I may well use many of these icons - I think I would change the folder icon first because I don't really like the Dapper folder icon :P - oh, and don't worry about submitting your own work if you want to! everything I have added ('cept NuoveXT) is done by me ;)''

* *That's odd, Dapper's folder icons are my favorite part of the set - Derick_eisenhardt(2006-09-01@15:31CDT)

* *I second the HumanAzul suggestion.  It maintains some continuity with the regular Human theme.  The only issue I can think of: HumanAzul uses a darker blue than the Blubuntu theme. - Greg Unger

=== Dropline Neu!, by  MarceloAtie ===

http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Dropline+Neu%21?content=38835

I vote to Dropline Neu, this is very clean, modern, and the colors help to differentiate the icons.

I don't think that icons only blue will be good.
