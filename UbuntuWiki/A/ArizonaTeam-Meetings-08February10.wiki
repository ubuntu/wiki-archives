[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:05:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	First off, we've had some instances of rude behavior and people attacking other people in the team channel. This will not be tolerated!! We have never had this problem before, and it is not something we want happening. Anyone how continues to act in such a manner will be banned from the channel. This is not only a working ubuntu channel, it is our social channel too. Everyone _MUST_ make the effort to get along and stop this child

[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:32:33] <johnc4510>	that might be ok
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:32:40] <johnc4510>	depending on the weather

[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:34:30] <johnc4510>	ok, well then phoenix again, how about a local library or ASU?
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:34:38] <slofgren>	would it be worth have other events going along with the install fest - lanparty etc
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:34:46] <johnc4510>	i don't think we have contacts at ASU right now
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:34:57] <johnc4510>	slofgren: kk
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:35:17] <enigmastrat>	ha! did you see my message earlier?

[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:35:41] <t00na|dead>	Guys... I'm dead
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:35:44] <slofgren>	I guess I am out of turn/subject
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:36:08] <slofgren>	johnc4510: it depends on who you want your focus audiance to be
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:36:10] <enigmastrat>	I mentioned I run a LAN party in Peoria.  I offered to maybe have one that day
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:36:22] <slofgren>	college/home/tinkerer/parent
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:37:02] <johnc4510>	slofgren: well, i don't really care on who, but i think the college set would be more receptive maybe  ???
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:37:17] <slofgren>	not always
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:37:21] <soldats>	so i feel then when all this gets sorted out we need to come up with some flyers to promote it and maybe have some people flyer around at lan places and colleges and such. it will help to better expose it
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:37:34] <johnc4510>	the main thing in all this is that we have man power to do this
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:37:40] <slofgren>	sometimes the local IT pro or spend thrift gets more involved
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:37:56] <johnc4510>	i don't want to get this thing going and have like 2 members show up
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:38:04] <slofgren>	yeah
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:38:05] <johnc4510>	slofgren: true
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:38:12] <soldats>	thats why we flyer for it
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:38:23] <tyche>	Especially if it's manpower like me, who doesn't know what he's doing.
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:38:45] <johnc4510>	i should add computer shops to the flyer, advertising list
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:38:53] <johnc4510>	makes note
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:38:56] <soldats>	yes
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:38:57] <johnc4510>	to do
[Sun Feb 10 2008] [21:39:30] <johnc4510>	ok, well, you phoenix people, please think about location this wk, and try to come up with an idea
