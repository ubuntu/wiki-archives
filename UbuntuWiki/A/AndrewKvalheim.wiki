=== Bio ===

As a student studying molecular biology, I consider myself an Ubuntu end-user representing the interests of the academic and scientific communities. I'm a strong believer in the need to be informed about open source alternatives to commercial software, but at the same time take a stance against the reckless, anti-corporation Linux evangelism I've too often seen pressure inexperienced users into having bad first experiences with Linux.

While I can't contribute back to the open source community with software development, I do what I can to share what I've learned and support others who have decided to use Ubuntu.
