__TOC__

=== About ===

I am a JEE and JSE developer with some experience in C, GTK+ and Python.

I have been a 10 years + user of GNU/Linux and have mostly stuck with Ubuntu since around 2006.

I would like to get involved in Ubuntu development and from what I have read a good way to get started is by doing some bug work.

Therefore I am looking for a mentor who will patiently guide me :-)

=== Area of Interest ===

All desktop and GUI app related things, Ubuntu ONE, Unity and possibly others. 

=== Availability ===

Roughly Monday-Friday 9:00-13:00 CEST (7:00-11:00 UTC) and 21:00-23:00 CEST (19:00-21:00 UTC)
