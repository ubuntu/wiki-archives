__TOC__

Other pages for this artwork cycle: 

=== Ubuntu-themed branding for Aisleriot ===
Ubuntu-themed artwork for the Gnome solitaire game titled "Aisleriot".

'''*'''  A tiled background (with a small Ubuntu logo)

'''*'''  New card backs

'''*'''  Fresh colors

=== Current issues ===
The card back image file (gnomangelo_bitmap.svg) is currently too large. It is almost twice the original size, due to the complexity of the pattern on the cards.

=== Download ===
Download the files <nowiki>[[http://files.getdropbox.com/u/175241/wanted/aisleriot-artwork.tar.gz|here]]</nowiki>. I've included a simple script that will copy the files to the right folders for you (''only tested on Jaunty'').

** Since these are svg cards, wouldn't it be better to use the royal cards from here instead? http://david.bellot.free.fr/svg-cards/
I also reduced the size by 50% by using gzip compression on the cards. (Right click on svg, Create Archive, change to .gz, Create and then rename the resulting file with a .svg extension.) It works in both inkscape and aisleriot as normal. http://files.getdropbox.com/u/336801/gnomangelo_bitmap.svg -Durand (Monday, 22 June 2009 10:34 PM)

** Thank you so much! I've been very puzzled by the filesize :-). As for the david.bellot cards, I really don't understand what there is to gain from the cards? The standard Gnome cards are also .SVG //MadsRH
** If you look at the actual pictures on the cards, the gnome cards use a bitmap image. david.bellot has used vectors there. The only problem would be the increased file size. -Durand
* The blue shade is a bit loud,against the background. The previous blue [gnome], was more pleasant, either that shade of blue or something in between the two would be better. -mac_v
