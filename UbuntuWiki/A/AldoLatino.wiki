== Who I am ==
I am a PC enthusiast, attracted by opensource world and specifically by GNU/Linux. When I tested some Linux distros, my experience of this wonderful Operating System didn't grow very much; but when I knew Ubuntu - very desktop-oriented distro - the beautyful of Linux appeared to me.

I am a member of Ubuntu-it team.
