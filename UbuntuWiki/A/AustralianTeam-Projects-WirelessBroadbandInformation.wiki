== Australian Wireless Broadband Compatibility List ==

This page aims to provide localised information on what Wireless Broadband
devices and networks are compatible (out of the box or with configuration).

It also includes some Australian network information (APN & DNS IP) that is
also useful when setting up a new wireless broadband device.

Feel free to add your experiences here, if you are not sure how to edit this
website feel free to email the list for someone to help you out.

If there is any more specific details you want that is not listed here than 
an email to the list would be a good start.

| ZTE MF626 / MF636
| Telstra
| 9.10/10.04
| requires mode switching
| Appears as a CD on the desktop on first insert. Right click and select 'Safely Remove Hardware' then it gets reattached internally as a modem and can be used as normal. YMMV, as I have to use "Eject" for the modeswitching to occur (on 9.10), and sometimes requires a change of usb port to get working. Command line tool to disable the need for modeswitch is available at: http://github.com/agentk/ztecdrun

=== General Notes ===

If the USB modem does not immediately attempt connecting once you've saved the correct settings, move the USB modem to another port on the PC, this seems to work occasionally.

If you need to use SMS (e.g. Optus sends the mobile number needed for recharging prepaid modems by SMS), install Betavine Connection Manager (Lucid and later) from https://forge.betavine.net/frs/?group_id=76

=== Useful links ===

Sakis3G script- Sakis3G is a tweaked shell script which is supposed to work out-of-the-box for establishing a 3G connection with any combination of modem or operator. It automagically setups your USB or Bluetooth™ modem, and may even detect operator settings. You should try it when anything else fails!
