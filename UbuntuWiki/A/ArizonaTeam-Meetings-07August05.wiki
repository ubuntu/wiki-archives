21:23 < johnc4510> The US Teams Project, with the help of a lot of state teams set up 9 new states teams last Monday and Tuesday. On Saturday evening they hosted a meet up in the #ubuntu-us channel. There were 103 members in the channel, and a good time was had by all. 
21:23 < johnc4510> that ends the announcements
21:24 < johnc4510> .

21:26 < johnc4510> great i will leave it to you two
21:26 < johnc4510> next
21:26 < johnc4510> Education Team - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Education
21:26 < johnc4510> br24: have you and paul gotten together yet
21:26 < br24> I apologize I have not been able to work on any Edu projects
21:26 < br24> not yet
21:26 < martyd215> jeez
21:27 < martyd215> *guilt trip*
21:27 < br24> I am the slacker
21:27 < martyd215> Just kidding!
21:27 < br24> all I ever think about is my biz
21:27 < johnc4510> br24: i will get you his email address ok
21:27 < johnc4510> br24: np
21:27 < br24> 10-4
21:27 < johnc4510> :)
21:27 < johnc4510> ok next 
21:28 < johnc4510> i haven't heard from DX on the server
21:28 < johnc4510> i will email him this wk 
21:28 < johnc4510> comp4kids - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Computers4Kids
21:28 < johnc4510> bluecat
21:28 < johnc4510> and i have some news on tax exemption
21:28 < johnc4510> bluecat9: you here?
21:29 < johnc4510> hmm ok i will give tax news
21:29 < johnc4510> I have been working on the tax exemption problem. There is good and bad news.
21:29 < johnc4510> The bad news is that this is going to take some time to accomplish.
21:29 < johnc4510> The good news is that the US LoCo Teams Project is going to work on this problem so the all the state loco teams will eventually be covered by one tax exempt id #.
21:30 < br24> nice
21:30 < jacob2440> so should we get our own/
21:30 < johnc4510> Then each state team would be considered a chapter of the national organization. By doing it this way, all teams get exemption coverage at the same time, with no expence.
21:30 < jacob2440> Because until we get one we really cant take donations
21:30 < johnc4510> jacob2440: that's correct
21:30 < johnc4510> but how long will it take us
21:30 < johnc4510> ?
21:30 < jacob2440> well thats a good question
21:31 < johnc4510> and how much money
21:31 < jacob2440> free
21:31 < jacob2440> if i do all the work
21:31 < johnc4510> well ok
21:31 < jacob2440> its just rather hard
21:31 < jacob2440> and we have to come up with bylaws and such
21:31 < johnc4510> do you think about 6 mths?
21:31 < johnc4510> more
21:31 < johnc4510> less
21:31 < johnc4510> ?
21:31 < jacob2440> i will send you a list of all things needed
21:31 < johnc4510> ok
21:32 < jacob2440> well it could be one weekend if i sat down and really pounded this out
21:32 < jacob2440> i will start working on it when i get to the office on monday
21:32 < johnc4510> with this other way    someone else will be having all the headaches of doing it
21:32 < jacob2440> correct
21:32 < johnc4510> jacob2440: something else
21:32 < jacob2440> when did they say they will have this setup?
21:33 < johnc4510> someone mentioned that instead of 501c3
21:33 < johnc4510> 501c8 i think it was
21:33 < johnc4510> ?
21:33 < jacob2440> hmm i will look into it
21:33 < johnc4510> i'll have to look at notes on that one
21:33 < johnc4510> and let you know
21:33 < johnc4510> jacob2440: it will take a while for the other way
21:33 < jacob2440> a 501c3 is the only way for tax excemotion
21:33 < johnc4510> k
21:34 < johnc4510> well, we will talk some more then
21:34 < johnc4510> k
21:34 < johnc4510> ?
21:34 < jacob2440> ok
21:34 < johnc4510> ty
21:34 < johnc4510> Team Approval Process
21:34 < johnc4510> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline
21:34 < johnc4510> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline/Resources
21:34 < johnc4510> .
21:35 < johnc4510> This is our on going Arizona Team project to qualify to be an approved team. Approved teams get special perks that unapproved teams don't. Such as bulk shipments of Ubuntu CD's, team blogging rights on Planet Ubuntu, and the ability to have a team page on the main ubuntu web site. 
21:35 < johnc4510> .
21:35 < johnc4510> The first thing I want to do is direct everyone to this page: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=516885  Please look over the cd cover sleaves made up by team member Marty. Especially the 3rd post down. Then lets discuss them. 
21:37 < johnc4510> ok, has everyone had a chance to look it over?
21:37 < jsonder> yup
21:37 < donchriscoe> yes - I like the cd live part
21:37 < johnc4510> this is a prototype of what we might use on the cd's we are burning for the approval project
21:37 < jacob2440> yea
21:37 < br24> looks like tasty chicken
21:38 < johnc4510> please voice pros cons or other ideas
21:38 < johnc4510> marty did a great job
21:38 < johnc4510> :)
21:38 < br24> I would change the wording on "what is ubuntu?"
21:38 < jsonder> I prefer paper sleeve to jewel cases
21:38 < br24> Windows and MacOS are nore free, open source
21:38 < br24> not that is
21:38 < johnc4510> jsonder:me to
21:39 < johnc4510> i think these look pretty nice 
21:39 < johnc4510> :)
21:39 < johnc4510> br24: let me look
21:40 < donchriscoe> just the right amount of graphics and verbiage for me fwiw
21:40 < johnc4510> br24: what would like it to say please
21:40 < johnc4510> ?
21:40 < br24> put a hyphen between software and based
21:40 < johnc4510> k
21:40 < johnc4510> anything else?
21:41 < br24> maybe something about Ubuntu being an OS, like Winders and Mac, only it is free
21:41 < johnc4510> martyd215: commments
21:41 < johnc4510> ?
21:41 < br24> I do like the "Linux is used in top supercomputers" part
21:41 < johnc4510> martyd215: you here?
21:42 < johnc4510> yes me too
21:42 < johnc4510> hmm marty doesn't seem to be around
21:42 <      br24> johnc4510, are we going to include CDs with Screencasts?
21:42 < johnc4510> maybe
21:43 < johnc4510> it would be a separate cd
21:43 < johnc4510> though
21:43 < johnc4510> not enough room
21:43 < br24> yes I figured that much
21:43 < johnc4510> ubuntu takes up like 697 mb
21:43 < johnc4510> of a 700 mb cd
21:43 < johnc4510> :/
21:43 < johnc4510> so it is still up for discussion
21:44 < br24> if we are, then maybe we can add that to the Dual Boot part, instead of searching
21:44 < johnc4510> but i like the idea myself
21:44 < johnc4510> :)
21:44 < johnc4510> br24: can you email what changes you would like to see to these covers?
21:44 < br24> okay
21:44 < johnc4510> ty
21:45 < br24> we should have Ubuntu-AZ wiki on there as well
21:45 < johnc4510> i will get with marty then     true
21:45 < johnc4510> ty
21:45 < johnc4510> ok next
21:45 < johnc4510> I also want to note that members are not recording how many ubuntu cd's the are donating and burning. We need you to keep this info up to date please. Thanks
21:46 < johnc4510> new members feel free to voluteer for any of the projects  just edit yourself in please
21:46 < jsonder> does this include alphas ?
21:46 < johnc4510> if you need help let me know
21:46 < johnc4510> no   no alphas
21:46 -!- martyd215 [n=Jakob@ip70-171-221-46.tc.ph.cox.net] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]

21:47 < johnc4510> that i am looking forward too
21:47 < johnc4510> :)
21:47 < johnc4510> That is about all I have right now, unless any members would like to discuss anything?
21:47 < johnc4510> floor is open for now
