=== About ===

Candy icon theme is created by Jonian Guveli and Olibia Tsati. It is a modern icon theme for the GNOME desktop environment with the goals listed below in mind:

'''Consistency:''' All the icons are designed following the same guidelines.<<BR>><<BR>>
'''Easy Customization:''' The color that defines the icon theme is used only in folders and arrows. So, creating an new icon theme is fast and easy.<<BR>><<BR>>
'''Quick Development:''' The use of the one-canvas-workflow makes the development of the icons fast because all icons sizes are in one .svg file. Then the organization of the files is handled by a script and so the creation of symbolic links. This also helps in not having missing icon sizes.<<BR>><<BR>>

=== Comments ===

I '''really''' like this, it seems good enough to be adopted as the default theme. The only comment I have is that brown is still used quite extensively in this theme, when purple and orange are now Ubuntu's colors. (How are you supposed to sign this?)
 - We are going to create a fork with colors matching the new ubuntu color pallete.
