 04:25 <wmack1> How did the installfest go on Sat?

 04:26 <xHans> and toddc needs help, so please step up to help out with the loCo

 04:26 <toddc> very busy 8-9 full installs plus turbidTux server and several repairs

 04:26 <wmack1> glad to hear that.

 04:27 <toddc> Thanks for coming here tonight I will be hear here for a while if you have any questions

 04:27 <wmack1> I did two installs of 14.04 these last few days.

 04:27 <MajB> I did one Lubuntu 14.04 (on my own machine).

 04:28 <NeoNetNinja> I'm waiting on a response from Starbucks regarding a potential meeting here in Tucson (possibly beginning May 23rd) If/when it happens all are welcome.

 04:28 <wmack1> broadcom wireless is still messy, but got it to work finally

 04:30 <NeoNetNinja> I got it in a VM on my Mac and going to use it with Nessus for LAN testing.

 04:30 <toddc> we did several ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04 and xubuntu and one unity to xfce change out and had one hp netbook with broadcom but I have done severl of those before I also got Marks laptop up and running

 04:30 <NeoNetNinja> It's one of the best releases I've seen in a while.

 04:30 <NeoNetNinja> The server version has some awesome features too.

 04:31 <toddc> since virtual box is not availible for 14.04 I am reading a thinking docker on the laptop

 04:31 <NeoNetNinja> Being able to install encryption be default will be a good thing for a lot of people, admins included.

 04:31 <wmack1> hmm no virtualbox on 14.04?

 04:32 <NeoNetNinja> they probably will before too long, just wait.

 04:32 <NeoNetNinja> This is week 1

 04:32 <toddc> as a pc tek I hate encryption due to recovery issues      ME WAIT NEVER!!!! :)

 04:32 <NeoNetNinja> lol

 04:33 <NeoNetNinja> :)

 04:33 <toddc> so far loving Owncloud just monitering the bandwith needs
