== Introduction ==
Writing HOWTOs/Guides/Tutorials was and still a great interest for myself. Before I officially join Lubuntu Team, I used to do these writings on Ubuntu Forums. Then, after joining Lubuntu, I started to edit the Wiki Pages. As of now, I do have a great experience and my writing skills had improved to the point I built a full area for Ubuntu GNOME Wiki, which had only one page.

This is a sub-section from <nowiki>[[amjjawad | my Wiki Page]]</nowiki> to explain in details my involvement on the Wiki Area.
 
== Ubuntu GNOME ==
This is a list of the pages I have created, edited and updated. Ubuntu GNOME Team had only <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME | One Wiki Page]]</nowiki>. After I joined them, I decided to help as much as possible by creating a new area that will help both the team and the users of Ubuntu GNOME.

== Lubuntu ==
I've been one of the most active members of Lubuntu Team. I have contributed in many ares. One of these ares is the Wiki Area. I had great time and enjoyed a lot each and every time I edit/create a page.

Here is a list of what I can remember because I have done so many edits and can't remember all of these. It's been two years and I didn't put that on a list. I have edited almost all the pages related to Lubuntu.
