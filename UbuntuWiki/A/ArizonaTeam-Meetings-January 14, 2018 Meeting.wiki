 04:08 <toddc> Two computers in the same LAN chatting one night:

 04:08 <toddc> PC1: I was having a nightmare last night, it was so horrible.

 04:08 <toddc> PC2: Why, what did you dream about ?

 04:09 <toddc> A psychiatrist had no patients in his office and he was bored. Suddenly , the door opened slowly and a man crept into the room on four legs.

 04:09 <toddc> His mouth was full with pieces of colored plastic. He was holding strange objects in his hands. He was dragging cables along behind himself.

 04:10 <toddc> The doctor was glad because of the visit and exclaimed, "And what do we have here, a little snake? Come to Uncle Doctor, my snake..." The man shook his head.

 04:10 <toddc> "Oh, sorry, I didn't notice your legs. You're a dragon, right?" The man shook his head again angrily.

 04:10 <toddc> "Sorry... a worm?" The visitor spitted out the plastic pieces. And said idiot!

 04:10 <toddc> I'm the system administrator and I came to change your LAN cable!"
