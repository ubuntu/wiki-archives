<xHans> bitte
<toddc> that is all I have any questions or comments or other news or ideas?
<xHans> thanks for encouraging intergroup communication!
<toddc> glad to help and we have always had help from plug members
<toddc> Several other Teams have had great luck gaining new users/members using meetup.com
<xHans> and vice versa
<toddc> Thanks for coming tonight. I will be here a while if anyone needs help or has a question
<Xorrito> Also if anyone is in Tucson feel free to contact
<Xorrito> me
<xHans> I'm not a fan of meetup since their model is based on tomiguchis, but if we have someone who will press the "good boy meetup.com" button once in a while, they have an audience
<Xorrito> at xorrito@azloco.org or ricardo.abrian@gmail.com
<tuxmann> Is the CentOS Dojo a good event for a non sysadmin to go see? I'm seeing alot of jobs that want CentOS experience.
