** The Arizona Team co-sponsors a Linux Installation Festival/Linux Workshop on the First and Third Saturdays of each month with the Phoenix Linux User Group (PLUG) at  <nowiki>[[http://uat.edu|UAT]]</nowiki>.  In addition we co-sponsor a semi-annual Installfest/Linux Workshop with the Cochise Linux User Group (CLUG) at various locations in Sierra Vista, AZ.  We currently have 1 portable server to host ISOs and have just added a PXE server to speed up some installs.  From January 2020 through 19 December 2021 we have hosted 48 installation festivals/Linux Workshops attended by 338 people resulting in 30 successful installs and numerous repairs, Linux and FOSS instruction/training sessions, and personal and Team project completions.  Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the installfests in Tempe since March 2020 have been held on line becoming a Linux workshop.

** Ubuntu Hour Events are currently being held in Tempe AZ on the 1st and 4th Thursday of each month, Phoenix AZ on the 2nd Thursday of each month, and Sierra Vista AZ on the 2nd Thursday of each month.  From January 2020 through 19 December 2021 we have hosted 81 Ubuntu Hours (35 in Tempe, 24 in Sierra Vista, and 22 in Phoenix) attended by 348 people for an average of nearly 5 people per event.  Because of the Covid-19 pandemic the Ubuntu Hours in Tempe and Phoenix have been held on line since March 2020. 

** Team IRC meetings are held on the 1st and 3rd Sunday nights of each month at 9 P.M. MST. Our IRC channel, #ubuntu-us-az on http://libera.chatis is operational 24 hours a day to help users with questions and communicate with team members.   From January 2020 through 19 December 2021 we have conducted 47 Team meetings.  The minutes of all Team Meetings are also sent to our mailing list to enable those who could not attend the meeting to remain current.
