== Iconic Splash Screen ==

Some Ubuntu distributions have had a somewhat iconic representation of their namesake animal; case in point, Hardy Heron. This was used for disc art, splash screens, etc., and was quite helpful in quickly setting apart the distro. Development of a new splash screen can be coordinated here.

=== Concept ===

The Ibex is a mountain goat with long horns, which curve above its head. Intrepid means bravery; so let the Ibex boldly go where no iconic symbol has gone before.

'''Palette'''
Use mostly oranges and traditional Ubuntu colors, but the inclusion of blacks, yellows, and grays is also welcome. Be creative!

This are thumbnails of simple designs for such a screen; keep in mind that at this point they are only drafts.

* Both look to childish to me. They don't have any flow either.
