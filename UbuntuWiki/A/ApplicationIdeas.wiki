== Ideas for Linux Applications ==

This page is mainly to stimulate the imagination of the Ubuntu community and to see some really cool ideas for applications that can be built for Linux.  If you would like to expand on an idea, please create a separate page and link to it here.  Also, as more ideas are presented, they will need to be sorted into categories (ex. Photo, Video, etc...).

Now onto some ideas!

* 3d Photo Viewer - similar to <nowiki>[[http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/coreanimation.html|this]]</nowiki>

* Preview Program for Documents, Pictures, and maybe music.
