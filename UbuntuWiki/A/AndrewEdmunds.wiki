== About Me ==
I'm an IT professional and have worked with Unix/Linux for 10+ years.  I was a Unix sysadmin for quite a while but these days I deal with a broader range of technology, mainly for large enterprise customers.  I have developed software in C, Fortran(!) and more scripting languages than I can count.

I switched to Ubuntu for home use a year or so ago.  I currently use it for:
* General desktop use, including photo and video processing
* A home NAS device / general purpose server
* A MythTV personal video recorder
