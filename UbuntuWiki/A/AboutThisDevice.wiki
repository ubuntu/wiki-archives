__TOC__



=== PC ===

Choosing “About This Computer” should open a normal, non-modal window in the center of the screen.

<nowiki>[[File:about-this-computer.png]]</nowiki>

==== Ubuntu version ====

The main text in the window should be the Ubuntu version, followed by “pre-release” if it is not a release version, otherwise “LTS” if it is an LTS version. For example:
* Ubuntu 14.04 pre-release
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.10

==== Menus ====

<pre>
File
====  ==
  Close  Ctrl W

Edit
====  ==

==== Copy ====

Choosing the Copy command should copy all the text shown in the window, colon-and-space-delimited:

<pre>
Ubuntu 13.04 (64-bit)
Computer name: mistletoe
Model: Lenovo ThinkPad T420
Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo T8300 2.7 GHz ×2
Graphics: Intel 965GM x86/MMX/SSE2
Memory: 4 GB
Disk: 100 GB, 26.8 GB free
</pre>

=== Phone and tablet ===

The purpose of “About this phone”/“About this device” is to let you see and/or copy basic device info, for troubleshooting and tech support. This is implemented in <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-system-settings|ubuntu-system-settings]]</nowiki> (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-system-settings|Ubuntu package]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-system-settings|bug reports]]</nowiki>).

==== Access ====

<nowiki>[[File:phone-about-access.png]]</nowiki>

“About this phone” (on a phone) or “About this device” (on a tablet etc, bug Bug:1258211) should be accessed from <nowiki>[[SystemSettings|the main screen of System Settings]]</nowiki> — because, while it isn’t a setting, overall UI real estate is at a premium and there isn’t a better place to put it.

==== Main screen ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0" style="border:none"><nowiki>[[File:phone-about.annotated.png]]</nowiki>
|}

Each value should have the standard UI for copying it as a whole (bug Bug:1286282).

The manufacturer and model ('''1''') should be on a single line, separated by a space.

When being tested/demoed on a PC, the “Serial” ('''2''') and “IMEI” ('''3''') items should have the value “None”.

The “Wi-Fi address” ('''4''') and “Bluetooth address” ('''5''') values should be the MAC addresses for the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modems respectively (bug Bug:1356239).

“Storage” ('''6''') should have a value of the form “{amount} free”, and should navigate to <nowiki>[[#storage|the Storage screen]]</nowiki>. ''We might add other hardware-related items here later.''

The “OS” ('''7''') value should be “{human name} (r{image number})”, for example “Ubuntu 13.10 (r81)”.

The “Last updated” ('''8''') value should be the date on which a system update was last installed, or “Never” for a fresh install.

“Check For Updates” ('''9''') should navigate to <nowiki>[[SoftwareUpdates#Phone|the “Software Updates” screen]]</nowiki>.

“Software licenses” ('''10''') should navigate to <nowiki>[[#phone-licenses|the “Software licenses” screen]]</nowiki>.

“Regulatory info” ('''11''') should navigate to <nowiki>[[#phone-regulatory|the “Regulatory info” screen]]</nowiki>. ''“Regulatory info” is currently not in the product requirements, but we will probably discover more legal requirements to display information here.''

“Developer Mode” ('''12''') should navigate to <nowiki>[[#developer-mode|the “Developer Mode” screen]]</nowiki>.

==== “Storage” ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <^ tablestyle="float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0" style="border:none;width:310px"><nowiki>[[File:storage-progress.phone.png]]</nowiki>
| <style="border:none">→
| <^ style="border:none;width:310px"><nowiki>[[File:phone-storage.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>''Errata: • The header should include a back button. • “Movies” should be “Videos”.''
|}

In the “Storage” screen, each storage amount should be displayed in the most appropriate unit for that amount — to zero decimal places for bytes, and one decimal place for any other unit.

The storage usage on the device should be categorized, in order:
* “Free space” (not including empty space that the user can’t put things in)
* “Used by Ubuntu”, or “Reserved for Ubuntu” with the whole partition size if Ubuntu has a partition to itself (bug Bug:1374134)
* “Videos”
* “Audio”
* “Pictures”
* “Other files” (including Online Accounts plugins (bug Bug:1388188))
* “Used by apps” (including Dash scopes, and any documents and data saved by apps).

While all the sizes are being calculated (bug Bug:1422206):
* the chart should be an indeterminate progress bar, exactly the same width and height as the eventual chart;
* the value for “Free space” should be “Calculating…”;
* the value for all the other categories should be “…” (to minimize repetition);
* the list of apps+scopes should not be present at all.

“By Name” and “By Size” should sort the list of apps+scopes, “By Size” largest first.

==== “Software licenses” ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0" style="border:none"><nowiki>[[File:phone-about-licenses.png]]</nowiki>
|}

The “Software licenses” screen should be a page stack of items, in alphabetical order, for all the packages included in the system image, including all default apps.

Each item should navigate to a screen with the package name as its header, followed by the text of the copyright license(s) that cover that package in the standard UI font. If the text is not available, the sentence “Sorry, there was a problem displaying this license.” should appear instead, and System Settings should automatically <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ErrorTracker#app-requested|report it as a RecoverableError]]</nowiki> (bug Bug:1206150).

{| class="wikitable"

| <tablestyle="clear:both" style="border:none">

==== “Regulatory info” ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0" style="border:none"><nowiki>[[File:phone-about-regulatory.png]]</nowiki>
|}

The “Regulatory info” screen should present whatever regulatory identifiers, logos, and certifications are required in the markets where the devices are offered.

{| class="wikitable"

| <tablestyle="clear:both" style="border:none">
|}

==== “Developer Mode” ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0" style="border:none"><nowiki>[[File:developer-mode.phone.png]]</nowiki>
|}

Like <nowiki>[[Networking#flight-mode|Flight Mode]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[Sound#silent-mode|Silent Mode]]</nowiki>, “Developer Mode” is a proper noun with both words capitalized.

The Developer Mode screen should begin with a warning icon and the text: “In Developer Mode, anyone can access, change, or delete anything on this phone by connecting it to another device.”

Whenever neither a passcode nor a passphrase is set:
* the “Developer Mode” switch should be both off and insensitive
* this should be explained by a caption, “You need a passcode or passphrase set to use Developer Mode.”
* the caption should be followed by a “Lock security” item that is a mirror of <nowiki>[[SecurityAndPrivacySettings#phone-locking|the one in the “Lock phone” screen]]</nowiki>.
