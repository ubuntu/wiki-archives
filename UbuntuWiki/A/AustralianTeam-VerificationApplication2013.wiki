=== About Ubuntu-AU ===
The Ubuntu Australian Team covers all states within Australia. Due to this, most activity occurs on the mailing list and IRC channels, but several events have also been held over the past few years. We have a diverse membership group, with several enthusiastic younger members joining, including two going on to become Ubuntu Members.

==== Ubuntu Members ====
We have had four new Ubuntu Members since our last Approval, these are:
* Joel Addison (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~joeladdison|Launchpad]]</nowiki> | <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JoelAddison|Wiki]]</nowiki>)
* Joel Pickett (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~jpickett|Launchpad]]</nowiki> | <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JoelPickett|Wiki]]</nowiki>)
* Benjamin Donald-Wilson (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~benny|Launchpad]]</nowiki> | <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/benny|Wiki]]</nowiki>)
* Jackson Doak (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~noskcaj|Launchpad]]</nowiki> | <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Noskcaj|Wiki]]</nowiki>)
* There are also multiple other team members with Ubuntu Membership that are at varying stages of activity within the LoCo but also contribute in other areas or have contributed significantly in the past.

=== Relevant resources ===
* '''Local CD Distribution''' - http://ubuntu.net.au/ - This has been run since 2006 by a dedicated LoCo member. As Australia is so sparse in population there can be significant difficulty in accessing broadband for remote users, so this site has proven valuable to all those who are unable to download their own copy.

=== Activities ===
* Listed below are some of the events Ubuntu-AU has run over the past couple of years. For full event details, check out the <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-au/events/history/|Ubuntu-AU Past Events]]</nowiki> page.
