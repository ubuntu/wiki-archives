=== What Wasp is ===

* Wasp is the first theme (as far as i know) that has had a script to take care of !OpenOffice.org apps.

* Wasp takes care of most used apps with adhoc configurations: no strange behaviour like dark toolbar where it shouldn't be, no redundant borders, no compromise on general setting just because of a strange behaviour in one app.

* Wasp is not dark and is not light: dark is beauty where it can be applied, so Wasp is dark where it is beauty.

* Don't like orange/brown colors? just use GNOME Appearance and choose all colors you want, Wasp is totally recolorable...

=== Dependences ===

* Wasp depends on Murrine >= 0.90.3

=== Comments ===
There is a bug with Banshee. It seems the theme is trying to draw a black toolbar but only gets this done in some parts. Look at <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Lucid/Wasp?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=Banshee_bug.png|this]]</nowiki>.
