[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:40:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	FernHans: do we want to sign up the event at SFD website?
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:40:49] <FernHans>	word: SFD is 20 Sep, we need to book a place soon
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:41:04] <word>	were you looking at the place being at asu?
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:41:04] <FernHans>	johnc4510-laptop: Dennis has a Phoenix group, we'll piggy back with that for now

[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:41:37] <FernHans>	word: it'd likely be at the MU, but maybe one of the off-campus places on Mill or even better a downtown Phoenix location
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:41:48] <FernHans>	UofA has digs in downtown Phoenix as well, I think
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:41:59] <lenards>	they do
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:42:03] <lenards>	the joint campus
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:42:27] <FernHans>	http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/teams/northamerica/AZ/teamtucson
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:42:34] <FernHans>	lenards: a joint campus?
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:42:47] <FernHans>	cool, that would be a good location if they have the right facilities
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:42:54] <word>	FernHans: ooo the MU will be all nice and shiny by september with the reconstruction finished after the fire :P
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:43:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	FernHans: who is mrapples, do you know?
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:43:26] <word>	i thought it was hilarious that at the orientation they said the MU was being 'renovated' and made no mention of a fire :P
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:43:30] <FernHans>	word: I forgot about the fire
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:43:59] <lenards>	FernHans: there is a complex they were building - thought it was done, all three universities have facility together downtown
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:44:03] <FernHans>	johnc4510-laptop: don't know him, I was hoping someone in Tucson would
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:44:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, i'm kind of lost now, are we going with MU location for the conference?
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:44:27] <word>	one of my old teacher's sons  is in asu's IT department and he's the guy that had to run over and try to remotely shut down the servers they have in the MU ;p
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:44:32] <FernHans>	lenards: can you check on that and whether it would be able to host an event?
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:44:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	should i still contact ASU?
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:44:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	again
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:44:52] <FernHans>	johnc4510-laptop: it hasn't yet been decided, yes, please try ASU again
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:44:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:45:16] <FernHans>	word: the ones up top that have keystroke loggers or down in the basement?
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:45:51] <word>	they have a server room on the top floor where the fire was
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:45:57] <lenards>	FernHans: I can see what the situation is
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:46:09] <word>	pretty much their main servers
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:46:35] <FernHans>	lenards: danke
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:47:27] <FernHans>	essentially we need several rooms that can be used for presentations and a larger room that can be used for demos and vendor booths

[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:48:32] <FernHans>	johnc4510-laptop: if we do a keynote, that's what we should plan for
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:48:44] <FernHans>	if we can't get the big room we can skip the keynote
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:48:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	agreed
[Sun Jul 13 2008] [21:49:02] <FernHans>	I'd like to get someone cool for a keynote, but it's not essential
