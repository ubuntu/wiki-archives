[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:00:01] <scott_ev>	Good evening everyone and welcome to the weekly meeting of the Arizona Local Community Team - The AZ LoCo!!!  Please give us a +1 to show that you are here.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:00:07] <todd_>	+1
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:00:11] <SlickMcRunFast>	+1
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:00:14] <tyche>	+.5
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:00:32] <azteech>	-1 +2
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:00:37] <azteech>	lol
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:00:56] <scott_ev>	well, I'm sure as we get the word out in channel that we are having meetings again, the numbers will go up
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:01:11] <scott_ev>	For those of you that may be wondering; johnc4510 is only on temp leave of absence.  He will return when he can to moderate meetings and to do all those other things he does for us as team leader.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:01:49] <tyche>	Or, if he's smart, he'll spread some of the workload out among the team members.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:01:57] <scott_ev>	I only have a few things
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:01] <scott_ev>	true
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:10] <scott_ev>	Announcing Ubuntu 10.04 LTS: The Lucid Lynx
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:10] <scott_ev>	wo years ago we announced the second LTS release, and what we hoped would become a standard practice of making LTS releases on a predictable two-year schedule, overlayed on our existing six-month schedule of desktop and server releases.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:14] <scott_ev>	We are now giving a name to the next Ubuntu LTS: The Lucid Lynx.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:16] <scott_ev>	Ubuntu 10.04 LTS will ship in April 2010 and is the culmination of significant work in Ubuntu, in Debian and across the free software ecosystem. LTS releases are maintained for five years on the server and three years on the desktop, so they are designed for those who are making larger deployments or who otherwise prefer to have a common platform for an extended period.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:21] <scott_ev>	Lucid will continue our tradition of focusing an LTS on a quality, stable and consistent experience and will require a number of adjustments to the usual plan. Those are documented at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynxSchedule, the Lucid Lynx release schedule. In summary, we will be more conservative in the new code we bring into Ubuntu during the development cycle, and we will run a longer test period. Our focus will be stabilisation
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:29] <scott_ev>	The Lynx is a predator that depends on very considered tactical positioning for success. It’s a small cat, which fits nicely with the lean nature of Ubuntu on both the desktop and the server. It’s stylish and sleek, the bow-tie-adorned James Bond of the feline set, so you can bet we’ll make sure it’s dressed for the occasion. The lynx likes to keep things in perspective, sticking to high ground. So do we. And it’s the nati
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:36] <scott_ev>	Speed is an essential ingredient in the attack of a lynx, and speed remains our goal. We have improved the boot time in each of the releases during this era of Ubuntu, and expect to complete some of the major improvements required for 10 second booting with Lucid. Fully harnessing Upstart, in collaboration with Debian, will get us even closer to the goal.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:41] <scott_ev>	Ubuntu 10.04 LTS will be a round dozen Ubuntu releases. 12 great cycles, from a great community that continues to devote itself to the goal of bringing the best stable free software to an audience of people who don’t think of themselves as computer specialists – and shouldn’t have to, either. It’s a wonderful privilege to be part of making it happen. That should put a tuft on your ears.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:48] <scott_ev>	that's kind of long,
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:02:50] <scott_ev>	With that in mind, we should be planning a release party.  Couldn't we go over to Boulders on Broadway after the April Installfest at UAT?  Does anyone have any ideas on this subject?
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:03:25] <SlickMcRunFast>	that sounds fine
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:03:40] <tyche>	Are you planning on doing any installs there?
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:03:43] <SlickMcRunFast>	Should we note this on the website or Wiki?
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:03:47] <scott_ev>	you guys wanna vote on it
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:03:54] <xHans>	did the LTS move up a release?
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:04:02] <scott_ev>	tyche: no
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:04:08] <xHans>	but, yes, start planning release parties :)
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:04:09] <scott_ev>	it's just to celebrate
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:04:46] <tyche>	OK, do we want to do any 10.04 installs at UAT?
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:04:54] <scott_ev>	a release.  we won't have disks but some of us will have it burned and.or on usb keys
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:05:06] <scott_ev>	tyche: prolly so
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:05:36] <tyche>	Then we should probably advertise on more than just the wiki and team website.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:05:55] <scott_ev>	tyche: can you put that on our calendar?
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:06:00] <SlickMcRunFast>	I meant just for keeping notes
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:06:18] <scott_ev>	I'll start letting people know at the upcomming installfests
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:06:28] <azteech>	as well as plan on one for UofA - if we can get things on track down here in Tucson
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:06:41] <tyche>	Do we have a date for when we're going to do it?  or will it be the last saturday in April?
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:07:08] <scott_ev>	isn't that when they normally are?
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:07:20] <tyche>	OK
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:07:23] <scott_ev>	azteech: I'm going to start working on that
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:07:23] <azteech>	tyche, would think we need to see if they still plan on hitting target date - so will recommend waiting until after the 1st of new year to see how on track they are.
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:07:58] <azteech>	scott_ev - okay
[Sunday 06 December 2009] [21:08:11] <scott_ev>	az, tyche was scheduling the installfest here, not tucson
