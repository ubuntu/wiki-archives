* What do you think you could bring to the Application Review Board

My background is in C and dynamic languages (Python, Perl, Ruby, etc), so I'll be able to contribute code review in multiple languages. My specific expertise is in implementing compilers and sandboxed virtual machines. I maintain several Ubuntu packages, both complex and simple. I see <nowiki>[[http://scratch.mit.edu|Scratch]]</nowiki> as an inspiration for the PostReleaseApps process, but also as a very different total system in a very different context.

I'd like to be involved in the initial app review, so I can better judge how the process and implementation should grow and change over time. I'd also like to develop a watchlist of "red flag" features for the process.
