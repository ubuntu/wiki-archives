     -I have replaced default eyecandy by compiz-fusion. Looks really good!!

== Motherboard issues after install: ==

     -Unboard sound OUTs(analog,digital) work, but not the mic.  So I disabled unboard sound in bios and added an
      PCI enconic sound card ???. Will get info on card. It works well.

     -Wireless does not work out of the box, but can with ndiswrapper.  Will get link!!
     
      -I found this site which claims the new driver now works.  Haven't had time to test it yet.
