==== Reference ====

Currently the theme not uses Emeraland but Metacity, because the themes must be utilized by many people and compiz at the moment is not usable for all.

As engine I use murrine-svn (by Intrepid repository).

=== Comments ===
* I've seen some wicked stuff throught the years, but yours really kicks ass! - Anonymousman123 Today, during Twilight. 
* In Sweden we also have this lovely animal, as well as "knekkebrøt" and polar bears - JachniNücklycken Today, 14:23 08/10/07
* Your concept needs work, make sure you don't make it too cute. The demographic has always been those in their 20's and 30's. - FOSSArtist63 34:43 12/54/23
* I think this animal opens the way to perfect contrasts in a theme / wallpaper / whatever. It's cute in a way, but also dark and itchy, which doesn't have to be the 'Ubuntu message' but it's useful in colorshemes and so on. In other words, nice! - TotalWormage
* The platypus - a sort of strange brown penguin. Hmmmm... I think I like the idea!
