__TOC__



My homepage (not so often updated) http://www.xs4all.nl/~anthon has some more information on me.
I have been developing software for a living since 1983, often as manager, but always hands on.
I am particularly interested in automating of things 'around' the software development process: version control systems, automated build systems, bug tracker, test trackers.

Made smaller contributions to the 'file' program, build RPMs for ReiserFS when that was not yet part of the Linux kernel.
