__TOC__

Frank Schoep's PHP scripts to generate Firefox themes that integrate with Ubuntu (package ubuntu-php-firefox-human) should be used with Thunderbird as well.  I have done the modifications to them.

Screenshot of Thunderbird Human:

<nowiki>[[File:thunderbird-human-screenshot.png]]</nowiki>

Here are the downloads of the three-theme set (each theme named for the icon set it uses):

<nowiki>[[attachment:thunderbird-human.jar]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[attachment:thunderbird-tangerine.jar]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[attachment:thunderbird-tango.jar]]</nowiki>

PHP source files:
<nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu-php-thunderbird-human.tar.gz]]</nowiki>

To generate the theme files from the source, run <code>make</code> in the directory into which the above package has been extracted.  Three theme files should appear in ../bin when run.

=== Feedback ===
Inclusion in Edgy?
Maybe we should find who is in charge of packaging thunderbird and request that this theme is packaged with it? Or is the firefox theme packaged seperately?
