I just saw this theme on Gnome-Look, it looks great with a more sophisticated side to Ubuntu (owing to the Black and the stronger orange. It is not created by me, but it is under GPL & I really like it.

We could use this, or maybe base something else on it (ie. a GTK Theme with Strong Orange [maybe using Murrine Engine] then a dark metacity theme, icon theme is up to you) if it is popular.

It is located here

=== Comments ===
* I really like the colour scheme with this. Not overly excited about the buttons, but the colour scheme is great. - LostOverThere <<DateTime>>

* This is the best candidate I've seen so far. There's some things I would change, but allover I really like. - MadsRH <<DateTime>>

* It is interesting, but the orange is a little too sharp and I don't like how the title bar is black. It doesn't fit with Ubuntu's natural theme or state-of-mind.

* Nice theme. I think you could make some adjustments based on Windows Zune visual style. - BasicXP <<DateTime>>
