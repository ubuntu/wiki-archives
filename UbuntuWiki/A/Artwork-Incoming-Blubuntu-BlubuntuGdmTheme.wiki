=== Droplet GDM (Who) ===
I have made a contact sheet of many options. PLEASE scroll to the bottom because I think the best ones are there. These are using the water droplets (evolved from mercury droplets) and some of the disorder of the BG that Helmet posted

* I like Droplet 17 the best. I'd also like to see a version very similar with a name list underneath the username/password box though (kinda like in #6) ;) - Derick_eisenhardt(2006-09-01@15:27CDT)
