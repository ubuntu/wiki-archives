__TOC__

When an app is banned/removed from the app store because it was determined to be malicious, do we handle devices that have already installed it?

There are two ways to handle it automatically: completely remove it, or remove it but replace the launcher with an explanatory message.

As a fallback, we could replace malicious apps with empty packages to be pulled during package updates.  Initial support for this has been started in lp:~dholbach/+junk/click-review-tools.
