Preliminary work for the Peace Login Splash(for use separately or with the wide-theme.

== Motif ==
A simple sunken box with rounded corners and the clean Ubuntu logo.  I would like to have wheat or some other grain overlap the box and make extra use of the transparency(aside from the corners).  Possibly a translucent ubuntu logo or something.
