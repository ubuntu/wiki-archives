__TOC__

Applications declare an apparmor hook in their click manifest (required for !AppStore acceptance). During installation of the click app, the click-apparmor hook is run and an AppArmor profile is created specifically for the application. The !AppArmor profile name is intentionally the same as the <nowiki>[[..-ApplicationId|ApplicationId]]</nowiki> (ie, "$(click package)_$(application)_$(version)").

The <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Specifications/ApplicationConfinement/Manifest#Click|security team's specification on the click manifest]]</nowiki> describes this in detail.
