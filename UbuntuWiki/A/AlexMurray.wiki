=== About Me ===

I work as the Tech Lead on the Ubuntu Security Team, since joining Canonical in 2018, helping to keep Ubuntu secure and deliver new security features for Ubuntu. I also host the <nowiki>[[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/|Ubuntu Security Podcast]]</nowiki>, a weekly podcast discussing Ubuntu and Linux security topics and covering the work done by the Ubuntu Security Team. I also act as one of the <nowiki>[[https://snapcraft.io|Snap Store]]</nowiki> Reviewers, providing guidance to snap developers on how to ensure their snaps can be sucessfully published in the store and reviewing / processing requests for privileged snap interfaces etc.

Prior to being employed by Canonical, I have been a longtime user of Ubuntu and have been active in the Ubuntu community for many years, on both the <nowiki>[[https://ubuntuforums.org|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> (username <nowiki>[[https://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=748826|alexmurray]]</nowiki>) and <nowiki>[[https://askubuntu.com|Ask Ubuntu]]</nowiki> (username <nowiki>[[https://askubuntu.com/users/218/alexmurray|alexmurray]]</nowiki>).

Many years ago I created <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/sensors-applet|GNOME Sensors Applet]]</nowiki> which then informed the more recent <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/indicator-sensors|Hardware Sensors Indicator]]</nowiki> which I created originally for the Unity desktop but which thanks to the GNOME Shell AppIndicators extension, can also be run on the modern Ubuntu desktop based on GNOME as well.
