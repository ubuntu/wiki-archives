[21:20]	dennisk	Descend on a coffee shop and demo Ubuntu!
[21:20]	toddc	but we set them up and post them on azloco
[21:21]	toddc	and I always know where to find dennisk
[21:21]	ACK-FIN	+1
[21:21]	toddc	welcome ACK-FIN
[21:22]	ACK-FIN	howdie
[21:22]	toddc	dennisk want to help set one up there/
[21:22]	toddc	I can help if they would let us
[21:23]	ACK-FIN	so, who's willing to b ring me some popsicles?
[21:23]	toddc	ACK-FIN: tonight?
[21:23]	ACK-FIN	yes, now
[21:23]	dennisk	Best done when ASU is on break. Right now it's packed. Sat. am should work though.
[21:23]	toddc	I will be in the hood around noon
[21:23]	ACK-FIN	I might not make it through the night without them
[21:24]	Yorokobi	go to sleep ACK-FIN
[21:24]	ACK-FIN	ah, ok
[21:24]	toddc	dennisk: saterdays are pretty full for me unless it is in the evening
[21:24]	ACK-FIN	but if I don't wake up you'll miss me
[21:25]	ACK-FIN	so are your saturdays?
[21:25]	toddc	or any evening during the week would be fine for me also
[21:26]	toddc	we should talk this week about more
[21:26]	dennisk	I'm sure we could show up any time.
[21:27]	toddc	ok find a slow time and let me know and we will try to get it going on a regular basis
[21:28]	ACK-FIN	-1
[21:28]	dennisk	d'accord
[21:28]	toddc	I was thinking like once a month in several places now for a west side or ???
[21:30]	-->|	LuftHans (~lufthans@wsip-174-79-56-141.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined #Ubuntu-US-AZ
[21:30]	Yorokobi	What's most central? Tempe, perhaps?
[21:30]	ACK-FIN	e mesa
[21:30]	Yorokobi	
[21:30]	toddc	the place we are talking about is east Tempe
[21:30]	ACK-FIN	153 n 58th st, mesa is the center of everything
[21:31]	dennisk	Dreamland Villa?!
[21:31]	toddc	but we should have several west asnd Tucson or north PHX ?
[21:32]	ACK-FIN	dennisk: pretty close
[21:32]	dennisk	Best places are where they is wifi and people with laptops. That way we can demo
[21:32]	ACK-FIN	and THEY have started showing up again
[21:33]	toddc	we have members all around the state but since I do not have a list of active members with addresses it is hard to say where the most members are located
[21:34]	[R]	tempe
[21:34]	[R]	north tempe
[21:34]	dennisk	Online
[21:34]	toddc	plus the Idea is to spread the word and help so several small short events could work well
[21:35]	dennisk	Won't hurt to include Portable Apps.
[21:36]	toddc	all are online but getting new users on IRC seems to be hard to do
[21:36]	toddc	would not need to be ubuntu but general linux open source chat ect
[21:36]	dennisk	They just need an IRC app for their phone.
[21:38]	ACK-FIN	is anyone here interested in an extremely nice SKS cheap?
[21:38]	toddc	I do like the demo idea and have wanted to do some for the installfest
[21:38]	dennisk	I remember being in Fry's or Best Buy and the salesman was explaining to the couple that M$ Office was NOT the OS. Most people know little about computers.
[21:38]	toddc	hoping to get several simple slideshows
[21:40]	dennisk	No weapons on IRC please.
[21:41]	toddc	well we should think about ideas and bring them up next week and see if we can get something going
[21:41]	ACK-FIN	huh?
[21:41]	toddc	LuftHans did you have any comments or news?
[21:41]	ACK-FIN	I'm licensed
[21:42]	dennisk	It's not this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKS
[21:42]	ACK-FIN	and bonafied
[21:42]	ACK-FIN	dennisk: similar, but it's shorter being a paratrooper and it taked ak-47 magazines
[21:43]	ACK-FIN	it's been heavily modified
[21:43]	toddc	thanks for coming tonight but I will be here a while if anyone needs help or has a question I will be here a while
[21:44]	ACK-FIN	kk
[21:45]	dennisk	Gute Nacht
