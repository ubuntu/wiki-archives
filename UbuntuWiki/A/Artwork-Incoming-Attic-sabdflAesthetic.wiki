== The Palette ==
This is a known set of acceptable colours for Ubuntu development regarding default artwork.  It is a direct collection of the primary hues available in the default 6.06 edition of Ubuntu.  Sources were sampled from the default Ubuntu logon manager prompt (GDM), the default Ubuntu logon splash, and the default Ubuntu wallpaper.

It should be noted that it appears sabdfl prefers monochromatic colour spectrum work.
