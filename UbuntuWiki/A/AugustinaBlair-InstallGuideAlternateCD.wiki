The Alternative Installation CD offers a text based interface suited 
for computers that are unable to run the graphical desktop based 
installation. 

Consider using the Alternate CD if your computer:
   - Contains 128 to 256 MB of RAM
   - Does not meet the minimum requirements for the Live CD
   - Requires additional configuration to use the desktop
   - Has no internet connection and needs to be upgraded to a new version 
of Ubuntu

The Alternate CD is ideal for advanced Ubuntu users who want to:
   - Perform an OEM installation
   - Install a command-line system without a graphical desktop
