== Ubuntu Scientists Group ==

We are a group made up of scientists, people who work in science related jobs and people with interest in science who share a common bond as Ubuntu users.    

=== Our Goals ===

# Help scientists find FLOSS alternatives
# Get universities to teach FLOSS instead of proprietary software. (or at least mention/show it...)
# Get scientists to be more involved in Ubuntu
# Try to convince scientist to make a career in FLOSS development

=== Who are we ===
