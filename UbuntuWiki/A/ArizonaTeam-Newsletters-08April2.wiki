==== Summary of the March 30, 2008 meeting ====

johnc4510 called the meeting to order at 9:01 PM

The first order of business was the Release flier that tyche put together, with johnc4510's help, for the Hardy Heron Release Party (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=740610).  kennymc0 decided that we should have release parties and he is putting together the phoenix one.  johnc4510 will get together with soldats and put one together for Tucson.  kennymc0 is trying to get one of the Peter Piper Pizza places to allow us to hold the party there.  He will get back to tyche with the address as soon as he can get confirmation from the place.  johnc4510 is thinking of trying to do the same thing in Tucson.  Members of the Team agreed that the proposed flier looked good.  [ed. note:  kennymc0 and tyche will be getting together during the week to finalize location and date/times.  Information will be confirmed with johnc4510, and the result will be posted to the forums as soon as the information is available.]

The next order of business was the installfest.  johnc4510 told the Team that the Pima location he had been trying for in Tucson was dragging their feet, and that he would have to try to find another location for the installfest.  Bookmans was suggested as a possible site, and Wolf_45 indicated that he would check it out.  The Greek Orthodox church on Ft Lowell was suggested as another possible place, and Wolf_45 indicated that he would try to check it out, too.  johnc4510 suggested that everyone in the Tucson area try to think of alternate possibilities, and they could discuss it during the week.

The meeting was adjourned at 9:25 PM.
