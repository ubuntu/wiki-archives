I am Agusto Cuervo Castiblanco, i'm over 8th semester in IT Engineer.
I start in the "Linux World" with Debian around 3 years ago...actually i got Squeeze on my other computer.
I'm the kind of guy that laughs about something and you dont know what was it about ... :P 
And if you are reading this, the question here is why do you still in this globalized world and still being a part of what they called "System", i think personally that "We" as a community are encourage to help those people to see the reality, just how it is... i quote: 

''"I'm trying to free your mind. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it. "'' '''Matrix'''.

And that basically what this is for, give freedom everybody's mind and like Jesus said: ''Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free !! John 8:32'' ...
