I'm just this guy, you know.

I am a very active member of the Ubuntuforums.

http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?userid=844

I strongly beleive in Free Libre open source software.  I am a big fan of Ubuntulinux.  I think it's success is related to how well it can tap into the potential of it's community.  It is technically excellent as well as a fine example of how a community-driven effort is done.

Forums are an excellent way to communicate, educate and motivate a community around a project.  I have helped make the forums more aware of the wiki and pushed to coordinate the efforts of both mediums.  I also try to motivate people on the forums to file bugs or bring their problems to the ubuntu mailing lists, when appropriate.

I spent most of my life in Montreal, Quebec.  I am a clinical perfusionist at the Kingston General Hospital in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.  I run the heart-lung machine during open heart surgery as well as operating a variety of other means of cardiac support.  I first used Computers in the eighties and was active on the Montreal BBS scene (before the internet, there was 300 baud)  (That ascii bunny was around then, too...) 

I used to use Debian before Ubuntu came along.  I like Debian because it is technically excellent, the Debian community truly represents Free Libre Open Source Software and it is marvelous to see so many different people working together.

I am married to my wife and have two little daughters; they all use Ubuntu.
