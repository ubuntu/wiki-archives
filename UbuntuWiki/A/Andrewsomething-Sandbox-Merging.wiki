This is a work in progress. I aim to write a more hands-on guide to using Merge-O-Matic than the existing documentation found at <nowiki>[[UbuntuDevelopment-Merging]]</nowiki> that could possibly be used at Packaging Jams or in IRC sessions. When complete, it will move to <nowiki>[[PackagingGuide-Recipes]]</nowiki>

=== Introduction ===

For a more detailed discussion of the merge process see: <nowiki>[[UbuntuDevelopment-Merging]]</nowiki>
