(http://tinyurl.com/yzdv42e) Like the installfests at UAT, this one will be from 10 - 4.  We could really use your help as the new installfests we ahve scheduled at the Escalante Center have been advertised in several Tempe Centers like the Library, etc.  We are expecting a big turn-out of people needing your help.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:05:23] <scott_ev>	did that all make it through?
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:05:37] <tyche>	Yep

[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:06:01] <scott_ev>	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1399585
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:06:03] <scott_ev>	http://www.azloco.com/node/128
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:06:20] <scott_ev>	Then there will be the usual Installfest at UAT on Sat the 27th from 10 -4.  As usual, we could use your support.  Please join us.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:06:34] <scott_ev>	that's two weeks in a row at different locations...
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:06:40] <scott_ev>	come join in on the fun
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:07:04] <scott_ev>	do I need to say anything about the release party this week?
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:07:19] <scott_ev>	everyone knows about it and is coming, right?
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:07:59] <scott_ev>	anyone awake?
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:08:03] <toddc>	yes but there may be lurkers here
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:08:04] <tyche>	No
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:09:09] <Yorokobi>	scott_ev, for the sake of completeness, when & where for the release party?
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:09:12] <scott_ev>	unresponsive lurkers don't count for much.  If they can't respond here, they sure aren't going to show up anywhere
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:09:35] <scott_ev>	There will be a 10.04 Lucid Lynx release party at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe (http://www.bouldersonbroadway.net/) on the 24th of April. Boulders on Broadway has a room upstairs that we will have all to ourselves.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:09:48] <scott_ev>	We'll have wifi access too.  It's going to be a good chance to eat some good grub, have a few drinks or brewski's and meet some of the other UbuGeeks that you have only met online. You're not going to want to miss this
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:10:03] <scott_ev>	Someone can pick out new features in 10.04 and present them or concentrate on one for example.  Anything to do with Ubuntu will be OK.  Things like how to navigate Launchpad and report bugs...
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:10:04] Quit	Flakeparadigm has left this server (Ping timeout: 245 seconds).
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:10:09] <Yorokobi>	Time?
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:10:16] <scott_ev>	Actually, if you have a favorite piece of software that you use you can present that even if it's not in Ubuntu's repos.  Please be thinking about this.  It will only make the Release Party more of a success.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:10:30] <scott_ev>	starts at 5 immediately following the installfest at uat
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:10:38] <tyche>	For more information, go to azloco.com .  At the top of the page is a sticky about the Release party.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:10:42] <scott_ev>	Yorokobi: I think it's going to be a blast
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:10:54] <Yorokobi>	I might be able to make it.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:11:05] <scott_ev>	but I'm having a real hard time getting amyone to volunteer to do a presentation...
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:11:05] <toddc>	cool
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:11:08] <scott_ev>	great
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:11:13] <scott_ev>	I hope to see you there
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:11:25] <scott_ev>	Here is a link to the Lucid Lynx planning page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/LucidLynx  Feel free to add to the ideas section or fill in anything that might be missing.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:11:47] <scott_ev>	bitflip plans on doing a presentatiuon if work doesn't get in the way
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:12:01] <scott_ev>	We will be heading there from the monthly installfest at UAT. http://tinyurl.com/yemru26 If you've never been to an installfest at UAT, you may want to consider checking it out.  Our LoCo co-sponsors it with PLUG but we are poorly represented.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:12:13] <scott_ev>	There's a proposed flyer posted at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1388113 please give us your feedback in the form of a vote with coments if needed.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:12:23] <scott_ev>	It's a chance to help another linux user or, better yet, possibly install Linux an a computer that currently is running that other OS.
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:12:26] <scott_ev>	http://azloco.com/node/120
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:12:30] <xHans>	scott_ev: I can't yet commit to being there, but should I be able to do so, I will also do a presentation
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:12:43] <scott_ev>	excellent
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:12:50] <scott_ev>	we would really enjoy that
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:12:54] <Yorokobi>	Will there be time for PGP/GPG signing party? :)
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:13:03] <scott_ev>	surely
[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:13:05] <xHans>	should the presentations be done at the Installfest or at Boulders?

[Sunday 14 March 2010] [21:16:12] <xHans>	I'm not a gamer either
