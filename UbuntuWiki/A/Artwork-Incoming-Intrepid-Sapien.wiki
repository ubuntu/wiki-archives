== Sapien ==

Sapien is a possible visual overhaul for Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex.  The basic principle is to use gradients and transparencies within the windows to create a smooth, intuitive interface.  Windows should appear as single units, as opposed to a collection of tool bars.  What this principle means from a design perspective is using as few solid lines within the windows as is possible.  Any contributions should conform to the palette I've provided, although I may update this to the standard Ubuntu colors eventually.

=== Concept ===
Sapien could be used with the standard human icons, or an entirely new set.

=== Comments ===
* Very good work and concept. I would definitely help if I was good with gradients and transparencies. Really, though, this is the kind of theme people look for when they realize that themes are an option. Let me know if there's anything I can do- isitolian@gmail.com.  -- PitrTMayhew 
* I personally dislike it how the title bar's colours blend into the rest of the window. It's too big and in your face to be included in Ubuntu 8.10, the abundance of bright loud colours is too much of an eye sore. Sorry, don't take it personally. -- Nicholas Kraak <<DateTime>>

* I just don't see that colour scheme or theme working -- Brettalton 
* I like the gradients. Finally someone thinks about those. -- Karoliina Salminen <<DateTime>>
