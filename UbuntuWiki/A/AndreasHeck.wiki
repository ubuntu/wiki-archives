Occupation: Software Developer

I'm a 26 year old software developer from Germany. The first Linux distribution I installed on my computer was a derivative of Red Hat 4 dot something in 1997. From there on I tried lots of distributions and used Debian for a while before I discovered Ubuntu with version 5.04.

After using Free Software for such a long time I think it is time to give something back and to implement some ideas I had over the years. I chose Ubuntu because of its friendly community and its focus on usability.
