== Szerencsefia's GTK Idea ==
I have created several designs for GNOME and I found it interesting. I was the source who merged different bars (menubar + toolbar + Metacity frame) into one complex design (see bellow). This idea can be used for the next upcoming Ubuntu release design. I would love it.

=== GTK theme concepts ===
These are real and workable example how to harmonize the menu/tool-bars.

=== Comments ===

* I agree wholeheartedly with your design idea. I've always found myself visually frustrated by nautilus and the like because your mind has to process too much to work out what you need to look at. By having this visual separation (not just a jolly line) it is very easy for you to quickly figure out what you want to look at. I LOVE IT!!! Socceroos  

* These concept images feel extremely open and accessible; much less crowded than the default desktop. (and I don't think it's due to the size of the images/lack of second toolbar) Excellent work!

* Could you provide a download for your first theme?  I like it a lot and want to use it.  Great Work!

* <nowiki>[[AlessandroDelgado]]</nowiki> 2008-02-03 A bit Vista-like, don't you guys think?

* Nah, I don't think so. I suppose you meant to comment the dark brown glossy theme, right? If so let say: "MS designers could make somethin' tasteful and they made though, my theme is still biting it." Try out my theme and comment once more after :-P [Szerencsefia]

* it only comes off as 'vista-like' because of the colorful background in one of the windows in the caramel screen shot.  In fact, it is NOTHING like vista. (And quite gorgeous!) Seeing these made me want to start using Ubuntu again, and I ''really'' hope they are implemented as a default theme, because I don't know anybody who's head doesn't turn when they see these windows. Great work!
