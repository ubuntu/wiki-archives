== thorwil's backgrounds ==

A Collection of Backgrounds in various stages of refinement. Most of them are meant to be in line with the briefing provided by Kenneth Wimer.

In short: inviting, progressive, balanced, refined, elegant. With a palette of mainly brown tones.

Possible sources of inspiration are the features coming with 9.04: the faster boot time, online services, the new notification system.

Glass is probably not the best name, but has to do for now :)
I took inspiration from a screenshot of the new GDM theme.

==== Laola ====

|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:laola_tn.jpg]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:laola.jpg|Fullsize]]</nowiki>
|}

People working together to make it happen ...
Rough concept, although I don't intend to smooth it out all that much, as then the lack of (facial) features will seem odd.

===== Comments =====

==== Laola Frontal ====

|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:tree_tn.jpg]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:tree.jpg|Fullsize]]</nowiki>
|}

Rough concept. Starting point was the idea of a "fast" tree. The tree stands for growth and nature.

===== Comments =====

==== Butterfly ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:butterfly_tn.jpg]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:butterfly.jpg|Fullsize]]</nowiki>
|}

Currently only a concept sketch. The butterfly is light-weight and fast (boot time). It embodies elegance.

Possible problems are ending up with it looking like a moth or too much contrast in the details.

===== Comments =====

* I really liked the idea of this one so I attempted to refine it! :D

==== Wood Block ====

| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:wood-block_tn.jpg]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:wood-block.jpg|Fullsize]]</nowiki>
|}

Wood can embody elegance, warmth and a tie to nature.

As is, this scan has too many defects, of course. I will see what can be done here later on.

==== Wood Cut ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:wood-cut_tn.jpg]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:wood-cut.jpg|Fullsize]]</nowiki>
|}

Face side of a piece of wood. The cut resulted in an interesting pattern.

===== Comments =====

==== Wooden trivet ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:trivet_tn.jpg]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:trivet.jpg|Fullsize]]</nowiki>
|}

In no way elegant, I see this as possible additional background, for those who like a bit of dirt :)

===== Comments =====

* Definitely these are the best I have seen, in my opinion. I even submitted some myself...and I like yours better.  I like the Suede ones and the Laola one and of course the Wooden Trivet which I am currently using. I will probably switch to Laola after a couple of weeks. I like to keep my desktop fresh. Good job!!!  -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:duanedesign]]</nowiki> 

==== Fingertip ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:fingertip_tn.jpg]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:fingertip.jpg|Fullsize]]</nowiki>
|}

Scan of a fingertip, reveals a wonderful pattern. Certainly human, but might be seen as freaky.

===== Comments =====

* I like it a lot; I was about to make a similar one but thought it may be too personal or maybe even inappropriate/offensive in other cultures? Anyway, I think is a great idea, but the fullsize picture looks blurry, very out of focus, for this concept to work a very high definition macro picture should be used. My 0.02€ ;) - -- -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:inigoalonso]]</nowiki>   * inigoalonso: thanks! Regarding the quality, it's the best I can do with my equipment. If I scale it down to my screen resolution, it looks quite sharp, though :) -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:t-w-]]</nowiki> 

== wakojakoo's Ubuntu perspective image ==

this is my first background, so plz leave comments!

got ideas from other people for the logo and the perspective and the gradient

<nowiki>[[attachment:wakojakoo_ubuntu_+peerspective_gradient_1920_1080.jpg|Fullsize]]</nowiki>

===== Comments =====

* I had to rename the file to have the .jpg at the end, as it won't be shown in the browser otherwise ;) Well, there's a rather strong consensus in the ubuntu-artwork community that the logo and Ubuntu label shouldn't take center stage. There's enough branding elsewhere and having this constantly in the background doesn't make us look confident. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:t-w-]]</nowiki> 
== Vorcigernix Trivet remixes ==

Building a better world. I like trivet motive, so I tried to remix them with perspective building photo.
