== Ravenizer's Idea ==

Being new to a Debian release of Linux, I found Ubuntu really intriguing because of its philosophy and its Aesthetic appeal. Therefore, i would like to contribute to this amazing cause.

=== Concept ===
I would like to bring a whole new meaning to Ubuntu's Human touch. I mean, yes... we all love the warm earthy colours that the theme uses, but isn't it time for a bit of change? A bit more contrast?

* I've seen some wicked stuff throught the years, but yours really kicks ass! - Anonymousman123 Today, during Twilight. 
* In Sweden we also have this lovely animal, as well as "knekkebrøt" and polar bears - JachniNücklycken Today, 14:23 08/10/07
* Your concept needs work, make sure you don't make it too cute. The demographic has always been those in their 20's and 30's. - FOSSArtist63 34:43 12/54/23
* I think this animal opens the way to perfect contrasts in a theme / wallpaper / whatever. It's cute in a way, but also dark and itchy, which doesn't have to be the 'Ubuntu message' but it's useful in colorshemes and so on. In other words, nice! - TotalWormage
