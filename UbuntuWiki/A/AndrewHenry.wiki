__TOC__



I've been playing with GNU/Linux since 2004, starting with Ubuntu Breezy Badger, but have previously been exposed to RedHat Linux 5, and several UNIX systems (AIX, IRIX, Solaris, HP-UX) in the late 90's.  I have been Windows free on my 2 laptops at home since early 2006 (an Acer Aspire 5021WMLi used as an SSH file server and a HP Pavilion dv9297ea: my main PC.  I also have an IBM Thinkpad T61s for work, but I do not have the possibility of installing Linux on this due to HDD size restrictions and the fact that it came pre-installed with a company image which I am loathe to fiddle with).  My day job is Oracle DBA but I have become a real free software convert, after being brainwashed by several rms podcasts :)
