This is the central page for the development of the Blubuntu theme, organised by JonathanAustin (Who)

'''You can help publicise the effort by digging this article specifically about Blubuntu <nowiki>[[http://digg.com/linux_unix/Help_to_ensure_Ubuntu_Edgy_has_a_slick_blue_theme_installed_automatically|here]]</nowiki>'''

== How To Contribute ==

'''Please note that this page is open for any contributions - see the submissions sections below. You must put any work on one of the SUB PAGES of this page.'''

Specifically at the moment we are looking for styles, motifs and design ideas - See /BlubuntuStyleIdeas if you want to add some

== Theme Rationale ==

Blubuntu aims to be a theme as complete as the default theme that can be a sibling to 'Human'. It aims to maintain the same level of polish, but sacrifice some of the uniqueness for ease on the eye

The colours will be less bright and more blue than the current Human theme.

The theme will aim to be cohesive, so that you feel like you are using a system developed as a whole, not made of many different applications

For edgy we will be pushing ahead with the art centric 'top down' approach for the theme, mainly due to time constraints. However, there is a /BlubuntuPonder page for collecting ideas and concepts that will allow us to rebuild future versions from this foundation.

== Theme Style ==

In my mind currently the NuoveXT icons and the Ubuntulooks engine in blue 'define' the style of this theme.

Some notes: I prefer the 'glassy' look of the scrollbars available in Ubuntulooks (set scrollbar_colour in the engine parameters), and am currently not happy with the scrollbars from Ubuntulooks - the Bluman screenshot demonstrates this.

''If you want to suggest any motif's, logo's or styles you'd like to see included then please add theme to
/BlubuntuStyleIdeas''

So these could provide some kind of guidance

== Theme Contributors ==

Contributions to the theme are open to anyone, but if you are serious about shaping Ubuntu's art then I would reccomend you join the ubuntu-art team (see <nowiki>[[Artwork]]</nowiki>)

'''I would like to keep a list of who is contributing to/interested in the theme'''. If you want to be listed as a contributor or want to be updated on the details of the theme then please add your name and email to the list at '''/BlubuntuContributors'''
