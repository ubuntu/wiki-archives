=== Concept ===
Karmix aims to be a clean theme, using the best of three engines : murrine, aurora and clearlooks. Nicer flat scrollbars ans progressbars, nicer scales, original clearlooks tabs and aurora's arrows.
Gnome-Human icons are the best we can bring to ubuntu, and to match with the theme, the human-aurora theme is perfect for metacity.

=== Desktop ===

A Mac-Inspired panel, with the famous AGM, the deskbar-applet, the globalmenu, also for switching between opened apps, systray with notes and media-applet from gnome live, and the compact style of the fast-user-switcher applet.

=== Comments ===
I'll hope this theme could be bring in official packages for ubuntu.
I'm working on varaitions to match with the other colors of the gnome-color's icon set, and because ubuntu users wants the brown to be removed.
* While I agree that you should do color variations of this theme (excellent idea), I also think you should keep the brown as well. I, and apparently many others, actually like brown. Look how popular the "Dust" them was, and it was based primarily on brown colors. My only issue with this theme is that the metacity is pretty reminiscent of a few other themes I've seen showing up on gnome-look lately, just can't recall which ones at the moment. That's not to say that I don't like it, it just seems a tad bit generic. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:blueyonder64]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>
