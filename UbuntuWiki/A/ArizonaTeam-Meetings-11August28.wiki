<toddc> Developer Meeting Thursday, Sept 1, 2011, 19:30 - 21:30 uat
<dennisk> I would have come but had a ton of stuff to do for school.
<toddc> xHans if you are here do you have any news for us?
<toddc> dennisk:  you are welcome to bring your class also
<toddc> that is all I have any questions or comments or other news or ideas?
<dennisk> I wonder how Paul got them to come on a Saturday?
<toddc> extra credit
<Dazed_75> Gave them extra credit
<toddc> but we did several installs for them also
<toddc> go
<Dazed_75> We had a problem with the PXE server this weekend.  Seems any install we did failed to use NetworkManager properly so networking had to be set manually once the client machine had been installed.
<Dazed_75> Turns out it seems to be a result from the latest configuration of the PXE server.  I believe it it due to using a dnsmasq proxy instead of a full-on DHCP server like I used to use but I need to test that.
<Dazed_75> In the meantime, a unit installed from PXE needs to have a conf file edited.
<[R]> i dont really like that solution
<Dazed_75> The file is /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf or /etc/networkManager/NetworkManager.conf and needs managed set to true instead of false.  Then the system needs to be rebooted.
<[R]> oh.... tahts better than the hack i did
<[R]> ahah
<Dazed_75> More research coming to find a better solution.
<Dazed_75> Was hoping to learn more today but I got tired
<toddc> np at least we know what the problem is
<toddc> thanks for coming tonight but I will be here a while if anyone needs help or has a question
<dennisk> Good night!
<Dazed_75> GN
* dennisk has quit (Quit: Page closed)
<bj0> whats a developer meeting
* SlickMcRunFast (~mark@50.30.218.254) has joined #Ubuntu-US-AZ
<spinrage> how do installfests work? I thought CDs or USB drives were used.
<Dazed_75> Whatever the developers want I guess,  I have never gone
<Dazed_75> IFs we usually use CDs or USBs, but people have been pressing for a PXE server for networked installs
<toddc> I went to one and it was about installing and configuring server programs and how to configure programs
<Dazed_75> I do not see a subject for the dev meeting but I believe they DO have one
<toddc> PXE is faster and easier to test os's but there are a lot of issues yet but most are working out
<isz_id> ummm. +1 !!!!
<Dazed_75> go
<toddc> better late than never isz_id
<isz_id> i read through and caught up
<toddc> cool :0
<Dazed_75> including the closing?  :)
<toddc>  :)
<isz_id> Sorry I couldnt make it to the fest on Sat. Been prepping for an interview
<Dazed_75> money is more important
* Siph0n has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<isz_id> well, it's for less money :)
<Dazed_75> less than coming to an installfest?  Hmmm, who is paying you?
<toddc> np we got by only a few had to wait only a few minutes and jobs always come first--along with family's beer
<isz_id> learning is invaluable!
* [R] has quit (Quit: Leaving)
<isz_id> picked up a netbook and am running ubuntu on it so I can hang with the cool kids (read: this group)
<Dazed_75> ROFL
