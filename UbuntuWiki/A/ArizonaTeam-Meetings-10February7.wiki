[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:00:50] <scott_ev>	Feel free, at any time during the meeting, to ask questions, make productive comments or observations: we want your input.

[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:02:00] <scott_ev>	suhweet
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:02:02] 	 * xHans will be paying attention in a few min
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:02:12] <scott_ev>	some new ideas about installfest...
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:02:22] <scott_ev>	It has been noted that not many people have been making it to out installfests looking for help.  This is, perhaps, because there's no real advertising.  So a few of us got together and discussed options.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:02:35] <scott_ev>	What we came up with is adding another installfest at the Tempe Escalante Community Center on a trial (3 months) basis.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:02:49] <scott_ev>	This way The City of Tempe offers us 3 ways to get the word out:  via their newsletter that goes to every resident of Tempe, by adding us to the bulletin board on channel 11, and by adding us to the website for the city.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:03:01] <scott_ev>	We can get more advertising by putting fliers up at other city locations like schools, libraries, community centers, and other city facilities.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:03:08] <toddc>	posting flyers also
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:03:26] <scott_ev>	ayup
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:03:30] <scott_ev>	We went ahead and made arrangements because we were trying to get into the newsletter.  The manager of the Escalante Center thought we could get into it this quarter but he was wrong.  It's not a huge commitment so we went for it without team approval.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:03:46] <scott_ev>	Please also not that this is a co-operative effort between PLUG and the AZ Loco and every effort is being made to keep it that way.  We want everyone to be informed and have an opportunity to add their input.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:03:58] <randlieb>	Hi...just moved to the Verde Valley area from Fayetteville, AR. Was about to start up an Ubuntu installation class at the local Community Access tv statio there when I moved. I would like to try to start something like that here in the Cottonwood-Sedona area..
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:04:18] <scott_ev>	outstanding, welcome
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:04:39] <scott_ev>	we don't have any members in that area as far as I know
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:04:52] <randlieb>	I have been using Ubuntu on my home computer since 2005
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:04:53] <scott_ev>	though i do spend alot of time about 60 miles from there
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:04:58] <scott_ev>	nice
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:05:06] <tyche>	Welcome, randlieb.  And you might want to talk with xHans (when he gets trhough playing with his new baby boy).  He has a lot of contacts and information/experience.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:05:15] <tyche>	xHans is head of PLUG
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:05:26] <randlieb>	Thanks I will do that
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:05:33] <scott_ev>	So the schedule for installfests will be as follows for the next few months:  Feb 27th - UAT, Mar 20 - Escalante, Mar 27 - UAT, April 10 Escalante, April 24 - UAT, April 24 - Licid Release Party - Boulders, May 8 - Escalante, May 22 - UAT

[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:06:46] <scott_ev>	thanks
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:06:55] <scott_ev>	Alpha 2 includes a number of software updates that are ready for wider testing. Please refer to http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/alpha2 for information on changes in Ubuntu.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:07:10] <scott_ev>	On Saturday I went to Tucson to meet Matthew Helmke who is one of the Authors of Ubuntu Unleashed 2010.  He signed a copy and donated it to us.  So, I have a question - what should we do with it?  I kind of thought raffling it off at the release party and we could buy power cords and power strips for the team or something like that.  Any comments or suggestions?
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:07:48] <randlieb>	giveaways are always nice
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:07:53] <scott_ev>	true
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:08:06] <scott_ev>	more the ubuntu spirit in that, huh?
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:08:41] <scott_ev>	Ubuntu Unleashed 2010 Edition Review
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:08:41] <scott_ev>	http://www.thelinuxblog.com/ubuntu-unleased-2010-edition-revie/
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:08:52] <scott_ev>	Also, he's involved in a complete re-write of The Official Ubuntu Book and will be giving us one of those as well.  I't several months away, but nice to look forward to.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:09:05] <randlieb>	definitely...I don't remember how I actually ended up on the Ubuntu web site but when I saw the philosophy behind it I was hooked immediately
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:09:07] <scott_ev>	There will be a 10.04 Lucid Lynx release party at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe (http://www.bouldersonbroadway.net/) on the 24th of April. Boulders on Broadway has a room upstairs that we will have all to ourselves.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:09:24] <scott_ev>	We'll have wifi access too.  It's going to be a good chance to eat some good grub, have a few drinks or brewski's and meet some of the other UbuGeeks that you have only met online. You're not going to want to miss this.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:09:37] <scott_ev>	Someone can pick out new features in 10.04 and present them or concentrate on one for example.  Anything to do with Ubuntu will be OK.  Things like how to navigate Launchpad and report bugs...
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:09:50] <scott_ev>	ctually, if you have a favorite piece of software that you use you can present that even if it's not in Ubuntu's repos.  Please be thinking about this.  It will only make the Release Party more of a success.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:10:04] <scott_ev>	Here is a link to the Lucid Lynx planning page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/LucidLynx  Feel free to add to the ideas section or fill in anything that might be missing.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:10:12] <randlieb>	Will you have cd's to give out?
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:10:21] <scott_ev>	not of 10.04
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:10:26] <scott_ev>	they come later
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:10:26] <tyche>	Oh, yea!  He has CDs
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:10:41] <scott_ev>	we ahve plenty of 9.**
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:10:41] <tyche>	Unfortunately, they're 9.10 CDs
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:10:53] <scott_ev>	We will be heading there from the monthly installfest at UAT. http://tinyurl.com/yemru26 If you've never been to an installfest at UAT, you may want to consider checking it out.  Our LoCo co-sponsors it with PLUG but we are poorly represented.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:11:07] <scott_ev>	There's a proposed flyer posted at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1388113 please give us your feedback in the form of a vote with coments if needed.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:11:20] <scott_ev>	It's a chance to help another linux user or, better yet, possibly install Linux an a computer that currently is running that other OS.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:11:23] <scott_ev>	http://azloco.com/node/120
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:11:33] <scott_ev>	I've started the making plans for our next instalfest in Tucson at the University.  Andrew Lenards made the necessary introductions to get the ball rolling and start communication between us ans the CS dept.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:11:34] Join	Dazed_75_ has joined this channel (~ad10a6cf@gateway/web/freenode/x-jmysfkfwrscjanxk).
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:11:48] <scott_ev>	So, it's time to start thinking about how we want to organize this event.  I'll need feedback from those of you that attended last time.  And I'm open to input.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:11:58] <scott_ev>	We'll need to do alot of planning so we can put on a good show for all attendees.  Remember that the University called it a Windows Removal Event.  That's because the CS dept has migrated to Ubuntu Linux!
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:12:07] <scott_ev>	Id imagine they are wondering where we've been since they wanted us to schedule regular installfests.  This would be a great opportunity to promote Ubuntu Linux to students and the general public in Tucson.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:12:18] <scott_ev>	We'll need fliers, etc. etc. We'll need volunteers for a variety of duties so please please spread the word in channel and via email that we are calling for help.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:12:31] <scott_ev>	If no one else steps up and offers to be the main contact point and organizer I'll do it.  I would prefer to have someone anyone living in Tucson volunteer to be the person to make face to face contact with our contacts on campus?  It's over 4 hours round trip for me if I need to drive down there.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:13:02] <scott_ev>	This weekend hutchnate brought up the point that we need to set some guidelines about hardware requirements for different types of installs at an installfest.  There are regular installs, dual boot installs, Virtual Machine installs, and Wubi installs.  Apparently there was some issue with low powered machines and VM installs.  We really should avoid trying to run into this at the next installfest
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:13:19] <scott_ev>	I'm proud to announce an Ubucon at SCaLE8X on Friday, February 19th, 2010. An Ubucon is an organized event for Ubuntu users that's halfway between an unconference and a convention. The main focus is for Ubuntu users to get together and meet others, share ideas, and improve their skills.
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:13:32] <scott_ev>	You might consider going to SCaLE8X since we live within driving distance.  hutchnate and I have already registered and reserved a room for friday and saturday night
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:13:43] <scott_ev>	but we're leaving thursday
[Sunday 07 February 2010] [21:13:55] <scott_ev>	Oh, if you don't know what SCaLE is, it's the Southern California Linux Exposition.  And Ubucon is part of it.  The Expo is heald at the Westin LAX. map: http://tinyurl.com/yacqsst
