== New System Sounds ==

I've made a first attempt at creating a new set of system sound for Ubuntu. I hope these will fit the new Ubuntu theme, providing a great user-experience.<<BR>>
The set is soft, clean and has a piano-ish sound. There are four exit sounds inclued in the package, a normal, short, fast and a longer version.

The files called "sound" followed by a number, is sounds designed to be assigned to an informational message, warning message, question dialog or similar. The "sound" files has a slightly lower gain than the startup and exit sounds.

UPDATE! A .ogg version is now available here: http://madsrh.googlepages.com/new_system_sounds_ogg.zip

Download .Wav version here: http://madsrh.googlepages.com/madsrh_system_sounds.zip <<BR>>

==== This package include: ====

- startup.wav<<BR>>
- exit_normal.wav<<BR>>
- exit_short.wav<<BR>>
- exit_longer.wav<<BR>>
- exit_fast.wav<<BR>>
- sound1.wav<<BR>>
- sound2.wav<<BR>>

On the link below you can see a screenshot of what commands the sounds are attached to. Unlike the screenshot I would also suggest to use "Sound7.wav" for the Question Dialog.

* That is a very nice sound theme that should go in Ubuntu. Why don't you show it in the mailing list? Keep up the good work. --AntonKerezov
* Fantastic sounds (espically start.ogg and exis_short.ogg). I'd love to see these sounds make it into in Intrepid, as the current sounds are getting a bit stale. These new sounds would compliment the cleaner, more polished 8.10 very nicely. What has been the progress on this proposal? --JohnKarahalis
