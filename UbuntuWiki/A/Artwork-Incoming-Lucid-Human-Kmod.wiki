Human-Kmod

=== Concept ===
This is the original Human-Theme from Karmic Koala with some modifications and surely a good level-up. If it isn't working perhaps you will have to install the latest "murrine-engine" (0.90.3).<<BR>>
- Recommended Icon-Set is "Humanity" (the newest version from the branch). <<BR>>
