=== Backgrounds for Karmic ===
For Karmic we would like to include a set of high quality desktop backgrounds which are organized according to a predefined set of adjectives which describe emotional atmospheres, slogans (so to speak) for the way an image makes you feel.

In order to accomplish this we call on anyone and everyone to submit images which are freely licensed and follow the <nowiki>[[Artwork-Documentation-Backgrounds|guidelines for inclusion]]</nowiki>.

==== The default desktop background for Karmic ====

We are looking for help with the default background, a design brief with more information can be found 
<nowiki>[[attachment:karmic_background_brief.pdf|here]]</nowiki>. Any and all questions should be directed to me.

=== Rules ===

'''Submissions that don't follow these rules will be removed:'''
* Copyright: you can't use material without explicit permission or a license that allows editing and redistribution. Always give attribution and follow all license terms.
* Background images must be attached to the relevant submissions page (no external links for reliability and archival reasons).
* For reference images, links to external images are acceptable, if you can be reasonably sure they stay in place. You have to use links to external images, if redistribution isn't permitted.
* Background images on this page must appear in a 300 pixel wide version, followed by a link to the full size version. This gives each single submission roughly the same space for fairness and reduces page load time and the need for scrolling.
* For references, plain text links with no preview are sufficient and help to keep the page clear.

Images without a stated license can't be considered for packaging and distribution. See our <nowiki>[[Artwork-Documentation-Licensing|Documentation on Licensing]]</nowiki>.

Filenames should start with the submitters name or nick and have no spaces: <code>callisto_background.png</code>

'''Take note of our <nowiki>[[Artwork-Documentation-Backgrounds|Background Guidelines]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[Artwork-Documentation-Backgrounds#Templates|Templates]]</nowiki>'''

=== How to add background images the proper way ===

Create 300 pixel wide versions of your backgrounds. If say, the image is called <code>callisto_background.jpg</code>, call the small one <code>callisto_background_s.jpg</code>.

Click the <code>Attachments</code> link at the top of the relevant submissions page(in the row starting with <code>Edit</code>). On that page, you can upload your images.

Go back to the submissions page, click "Edit". Add the following code:

<pre>
==== Example Name ====
<nowiki>[[File:dummy_tn.jpg]]</nowiki><<BR>>
<nowiki>[[attachment:dummy.png|Full size]]</nowiki>

@ SIG@

===== Comments =====
</pre>

# Then replace <code>Example Name</code> with a title for your image or set of images.
# Replace <code>dummy_tn.jpg</code> with the name of a thumbnail. Replace <code>dummy.png</code> with the name of the related full size image. Copy the 2 lines and repeat for additional images.
# Remove the space after the @. Do not replace <code>SIG</code> with your account name! The resulting `@``SIG``@` will be replaced with your account name and date/time of the edit automatically, as soon as you save the changes.
