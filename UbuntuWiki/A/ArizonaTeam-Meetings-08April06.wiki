[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:00:20] <kennymc0>	+1
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:00:20] <enigmastrat>	+
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:00:24] <tyche>	+1
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:00:40] <johnc4510>	where's soldats
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:00:45] <paul928>	=1
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:00:54] <johnc4510>	ok
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:00:58] <ianmcorvidae>	+.5 as usual
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:01:13] <johnc4510>	I called Silvermine Subs today to see about having our release party there, but the manager won't be there until tomorrow. They have wifi, and a deli style menu. The are located at 760 N. Tyndall Ave. which is just across from the U of A campus on the west side. Their website is here: http://www.silverminesubs.com/locations/
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:01:13] <tyche>	ianmcorvidae is only half here
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:01:21] <ianmcorvidae>	yep
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:01:52] <johnc4510>	I'm going to try and physically visit the place tomorrow to make sure it is ok, and that it will suit our purposes. i.e. space, plugs for laptops, cleanliness, etc. If so, we will need to plug the address into the flyer for Tucson and start printing and handing them out.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:02:23] <johnc4510>	.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:02:24] <johnc4510>	.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:02:37] <tyche>	No problem with plugging in the address.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:02:38] <johnc4510>	Everyone should try to print out flyers to hand out on a daily basis wherever they might happen to be. In other words, take some flyers and tape with you. wherever you go and try to get businesses to let you post in their window or on their contact board. Flyers should also be left at counters if acceptable to give people a chance to take on home with them.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:02:46] <johnc4510>	lol
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:03:05] <ianmcorvidae>	where is the current flyer?
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:03:25] <ianmcorvidae>	(I haven't seen it recently, heh)
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:03:26] <johnc4510>	tyche: can you get the link please
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:03:28] <tyche>	The Phoenix version is on the AZ Forum
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:03:32] <ianmcorvidae>	okay
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:03:50] <johnc4510>	tucson's will be the same but with a different addy
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:03:52] <johnc4510>	.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:03:52] <johnc4510>	.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:04:03] <tyche>	http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=64598&d=1207088622
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:04:09] <johnc4510>	We also need to put together a good email for the team list. We need to try and get some of the members who are not participating at this point to come and join in the celebration and friendship of a release party. By doing this, we will also be gaining a chance to get more help for the installfest that will be taking place shortly after the release party.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:04:14] <johnc4510>	tyche: ty
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:04:46] <johnc4510>	i'll take care of that part
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:04:48] <johnc4510>	:)
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:04:52] <johnc4510>	least i can do
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:04:53] <johnc4510>	hee hee
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:05:13] <johnc4510>	We are only about 3 weeks away from the release, so we need to move quickly to distribute the flyers. We also need to contact the radio show host that soldats has been in contact with so that he might give us a plug. Are there any other ideas about free advertising that we might use?
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:05:30] <tyche>	Craig's list
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:05:34] <johnc4510>	right
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:05:40] <tyche>	Phoenix is already on it.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:06:02] <tyche>	The auxilliary branch of AZ Team put it up today.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:06:10] <johnc4510>	paula(tyche's better half) had the idea of posting the craig lists in phoenix and tucson
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:06:18] <johnc4510>	:)
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:06:31] <tyche>	(You're not getting any dispute out of me)
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:06:35] <johnc4510>	lol
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:06:51] <kennymc0>	lol
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:06:56] <johnc4510>	any other media we can take advantage of??
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:07:35] <johnc4510>	hmmm, any radio in phoenix?  local computer shows??
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:07:36] <ianmcorvidae>	facebook/myspace/so forth might be good, but only if we have a set of people who are willing to try to spread the news on those sites
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:08:01] <johnc4510>	ianmcorvidae: good idea, whoever has a blog could post a notice
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:08:18] <tyche>	That's an idea.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:08:25] <johnc4510>	yep
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:08:28] <tyche>	Besides, kennymc0 needs some reading material.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:08:56] <kennymc0>	hey i dont like what you are implying
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:09:00] <johnc4510>	tyche or any of you phoenix people know of any local computer radio talk shows?
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:09:30] <tyche>	Only the one with RedSeven, and I think he'd object to my advertising on it.
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:09:37] <johnc4510>	they would probably plug us if they knew about it
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:09:44] <johnc4510>	lol
[Sun Apr 6 2008] [21:10:15] <johnc4510>	Have any of you Phoenix folks started distributing flyers yet?
