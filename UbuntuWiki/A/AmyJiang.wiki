I work in the OEM Channel Programme for <nowiki>[[Canonical]]</nowiki>.  My job is to promote Ubuntu by pre-installing Ubuntu on PCs/laptops with computer manufacturers and system builders.  I am based in Beijing and covering OEM opportunities in Asia Pacific region now, where I believe Ubuntu (and all other Linux) has the biggest potential to succeed.  We are going to fix bug No.1 here!

Ever interested to know more about OEM Channel Programme?  Or you'd like to introduce me to some system builders who wanna load Ubuntu on one of their product lines?  Or... what's the big deal? ... you may just want to ask me something...
