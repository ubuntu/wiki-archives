[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:16:24] <lenards>	the second is the "University Center" - which looks like, given the information, might be a solid location for the conference
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:16:50] <lenards>	I do not have any contact information on who is responsible for scheduling the location
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:17:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	lenards: is the panoramic view in the first link at the downtown campus?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:17:20] <lenards>	but the wiki access, "hi-tech" classrooms, and such seem like a good option
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:17:36] <lenards>	I was downtown yesterday for a dbacks game and saw a bit of the campus
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:17:49] <lenards>	johnc4510-laptop: I believe the panoramic view is the downtown campus
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:17:58] <lenards>	johnc4510-laptop: but I'm not certain

[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:28:18] <xHans>	McDowell is always under destruction
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:28:28] <xHans>	it's like the big dig, except without digging
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:28:41] <lenards>	xHans: I don't know who to talk with ...
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:29:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	is there a contact link on the site?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:29:10] <lenards>	looking
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:29:13] <xHans>	hmmm, ucent is two doors down from purl, maybe we should meet there :)
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:30:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: what is ucent
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:30:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	university center?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:30:28] <lenards>	johnc4510-laptop: University Center
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:30:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:30:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	hard to follow
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:30:41] <lenards>	xHans, johnc4510-laptop - real quick
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:30:51] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: I wasn't certain, ucent is what's on the map :)
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:30:55] <lenards>	xHans: I'm not positive that the University Center is open
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:31:14] <posingaspopular>	boredandblogging: ping?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:31:22] <xHans>	the NPO institute has a ucent address
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:31:29] <xHans>	I think there's also a dorm built into it
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:31:31] <lenards>	xHans: so I'll try to confirm the building is open ... and then get some idea about who to talk w/
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:31:41] <lenards>	xHans: okay
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:31:55] <boredandblogging>	posingaspopular: whats up
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:32:04] <lenards>	this worried me - http://copp.asu.edu/do/from-the-dean/civic-space
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:32:04] <xHans>	lenards: that would be great
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:32:25] <lenards>	xHans: I guess I'll just start cold calling people and try to be friendly
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:32:37] <lenards>	xHans: we have $0 for this, right?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:32:42] <xHans>	lenards: thus far
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:32:50] 	 * xHans can chip in $5 :)
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:32:56] <lenards>	xHans: we're looking for it as a donation of their space...
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:33:04] 	 * lenards chips in $5 more 
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:33:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:33:18] <xHans>	now we can have chips *and* salsa!
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:33:19] <xHans>	:)
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:33:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	for 5
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:33:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:33:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:33:43] 	 * kennymc0_laptop chips in chips and salsa
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:34:04] <xHans>	yeah, we need a place for 4 classrooms and ideally a somewhat larger room and then also an area where we can have booths
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:34:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	lenards: we need one room for keynote that seats 200-300
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:34:24] Quit	kennymc0_laptop has left this server ("http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client").
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:34:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	then a couple or three smaller rooms
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:34:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	for talks
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:34:28] <xHans>	we could do all of this at the MU on the main campus, but downtown would be better
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:34:35] <lenards>	johnc4510-laptop: okay
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:34:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	and we need wireless
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:35:11] <xHans>	the sticking point might be the booth stuff as ideally we'd charge a bit for that for commercial entities
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:35:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	lenards: it would also help if we can set up tables(booths) outside the main room
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:35:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	yeah
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:35:35] <xHans>	it wouldn't be much the first year, so we could just make booths free if that's an issue
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:35:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	agreed
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:35:52] <lenards>	if I remember correctly - the keynote hinged on us getting a room
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:36:04] <lenards>	summarizing
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:36:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	any sponsor money needs to go back into the event if possible this first yr
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:36:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:36:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	lenards: yes
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:36:29] <lenards>	bare-min - we need 3 to 4 classrooms with projection and wifi
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:36:44] 	 * johnc4510-laptop nods
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:36:46] <lenards>	with a space for 200-300... projection, audio and wifi
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:37:04] <lenards>	room for booths/tables outside said large-room a plus
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:37:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	lenards: classrooms for talks can be smaller i think, right xHans
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:37:34] <lenards>	all for zero dollars - and we'll include ASU in all of the advertising as a top-notch sponsor
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:37:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	lenards: yes
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:37:56] <lenards>	classrooms for talks likely to be space for 15 to 40
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:37:57] <lenards>	?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:38:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'd say 50, but ask xHans
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:38:24] <xHans>	classrooms that hold 30 would be good
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:38:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	k
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:38:30] <xHans>	if they hold more that's fine
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:38:30] <lenards>	okay
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:38:45] <xHans>	chips were easy, but the salsa was hiding
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:38:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:38:58] <lenards>	so I'll try to get into touch w/ someone responsible for facility management and scheduling of the University Center (UCENT)
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:39:11] <xHans>	yeah, facility gets listed as sponsor if it wants
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:39:11] <lenards>	they'll love hearing from a "wildcat" - I'm sure =)
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:39:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	lenards: if they say anything about cleanup and a charge, tell them we will leave it as good or better than we find it
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:39:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:39:43] 	 * lenards nods 
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:39:54] <xHans>	lenards: ah, yeah, I was thinking this is the co-uni place
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:39:58] <xHans>	it's ASU-only?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:39:58] <lenards>	johnc4510-laptop: I'll state that we'll assembly a cleanup team
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:40:18] <lenards>	xHans: I believe this is an ASU only piece of the joint campus
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:40:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:40:28] <lenards>	xHans: I can look into the UA side too
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:40:35] 	 * johnc4510-laptop will wear his u of a tshirt
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:40:42] <lenards>	xHans: but ASU seemed to have the better facilities
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:40:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:41:03] <xHans>	lenards: please do as a UofA tie in might get more Tucsonians to come north
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:41:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: agreed, but i will be pushing the lugs and such to come
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:41:40] <lenards>	I know that one of the UA buildings is a theater space - if they're friendly, we might be able to find someone for a keynote in another building... PURL or Post Office building
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:41:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	i will schedule car pooling if necessary
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:42:05] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: excellent
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:42:44] <lenards>	this is the auditorium I was talking about
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:42:45] <lenards>	http://www.asu.edu/tour/downtown/uaaud.html
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:43:04] <lenards>	I mentioned it as a "theater"... I know Tenacious D played there some years back
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:43:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	we should also somehow try to get the word out to other places
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:43:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	prescott will be easy, we have a great member there
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:43:31] <xHans>	lenards: BTW, are you on the conf mailing list?
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:43:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	he needs to be
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:43:49] <lenards>	xHans: I don't believe I am - but I can be
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:43:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'll send him the info
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:43:59] 	 * lenards nodes

[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:44:24] <xHans>	ah, tgen, that's a place I'm a little familiar with
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:45:00] <lenards>	one options might be to use this auditorium for keynote and the classrooms in the Mercado
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:45:41] <xHans>	lenards: ok, that time of year would be fine for that as well
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:45:43] <lenards>	http://www.asu.edu/tour/downtown/merc.html
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:46:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	lenards: just sent you the mail list info
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:46:14] <lenards>	well - I'll jump the hurdle of getting someone that knows
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:46:21] <lenards>	e.g. availability and such
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:46:25] <lenards>	johnc4510-laptop: thanks
[Sun Jul 20 2008] [21:46:43] <xHans>	I will check one or two people I might know at tgen
