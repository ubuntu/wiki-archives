Describe Architectures here.

Existing pages related to architectures:

* ArchitectureStatus needs to be updated.
* <nowiki>[[Specs-PortArchitectureHandling]]</nowiki> seems like a good spec. It would be worth checking if anyone has been working on it lately.
* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SupportedArchitectures also exists, and is several years old.
