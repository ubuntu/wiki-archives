== Polished or Satin ==

Tweak the Ubuntu theme engine to support an input from the Appearance Preferences gui that would toggle between a polished or satin look.

=== Concept ===

Themes would use that input to determine which type of gradient to implement.  The engine would have to support two styles of gradients and apply it to the menubar, toolbar, buttons, panel, and menuhighlights.

=== Comments ===

* Looking into the new clearlooks engine I see that it already implements two distinct gradient types.  Glossy and Gummy.  Both are applied to the toolbar and menubar now.  The polished/satin toggle button would be easy to implement.  Metacity may take some more thought.
