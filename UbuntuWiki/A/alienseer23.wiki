__TOC__

I'm Josh Panter.
My interests in Ubuntu are based on the free software philosophy, and the community. I am no code-ninja, but I am an avid enthusiast, and am constantly striving to expand my knowledge of software programing and the linux environment in general. 
I'm interested in digital media applications, and server applications primarily.
