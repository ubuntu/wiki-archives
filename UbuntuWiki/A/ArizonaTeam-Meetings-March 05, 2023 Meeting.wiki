 04:09 <toddc> LINUX QUOTES/JOKES

 04:09 <toddc> Have you heard there's a new disease you can get from using Linux?

 04:09 <toddc> It's Terminal.

 04:09 <toddc> Chuck Norris once went inside /dev/null, guess what?

 04:09 <lolberpunk1> I thought it was carpeltunnel.

 04:10 <toddc> He never came out..

 04:10 <toddc> I installed Linux Mint on my laptop,

 04:10 <toddc> So I told my sister it had Mint on it.

 04:11 <toddc> She then started licking it.

 04:11 <toddc> The boss was shouting at the co-worker at for not knowing how to use Linux

 04:11 <toddc> I asked him to stop, bashing much won't help either..
