Hi,

I'm Annelies Bollen, you'll find that I often just use 'Lisje' as my name on IM, mailinglists and websites.

Currently I'm a student, I study informatics (or applied computer science... whatever sounds like the best translation) at KHLeuven (dept. Rega), Leuven, Belgium.
I'm a member of ubuntu-be.org, that's how this page got created.
My current tasks within ubuntu-be.org are managing/assembling the eventbox(es) and I'm responsible for the fairs at Leuven.

To contact me, you can try mailing to: lisje at kleinewereld dot be .
If you want to reach me via msn or googletalk (jabber) please drop a mail in my mailbox.

If you want to know more about me, you can always drop by my website: http://kleinewereld.be
