==== New Items ====

* Meeting time
** It has come to light that the current meeting time does not suit alot of people. I will make a note to the mailing list about this and take a poll of the times people "can" attend - MelissaDraper (elkbuntu)
* Capitalisation of Ubuntu-AU
** Though it may seem trivial, we should figure out a proper capitalisation, possibly based on other LoCoTeams', so we can have some consistency. - YukiCuss
* A New Wiki Homepage ?
** I've been doing some work on <nowiki>[[AustralianTeam/New]]</nowiki> as an alternative for the exising wiki page at <nowiki>[[AustralianTeam]]</nowiki> . Do we need/want such a page? - MatthewVermeulen (MatthewV)
* APC Contact and wrap-up
** About the Correspondence with APC Magazine, possible outcomes - Xice (xice)

=== Actions ===

An article on "Dapper Drake" that mentioned the Australian team in APC magazine was discussed.  If anyone has pictures from any of the dapper launch parties please make yourself known.  Xice has sent a pic of himself to APC in the meantime, this was agreed apon by the group.

There was discussion on a "professional courtesy letter" This can be found via https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AustralianTeam/courtesy   The group decided that letter would come in handy in the future but would not be used in current discussions regarding an article  with APC

According to survey results, Monday nights beat Tuesday nights as the preferred meeting time.  Some discussion was made about changing the time to 8:30pm, but it was agreed to leave the time as 8pm for the time being

Capitalization of the Ubuntu-Au phrase was discussed.  Ubuntu-Au won.

A new look and feel for the wiki homepage was discussed.  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AustralianTeam/New was proposed and agreed apon by the group.  So the old wiki page would be changed to look like the new version, with some adjustment of the watermark to make the text easier to read (if this is possible)
