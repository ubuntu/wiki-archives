__TOC__

'''Notice: Most of this is old, but does contain some small relevant information. After deciding on a concept, a new page was created: <nowiki>[[/Collaboration+Progress]]</nowiki>
== Adding to the Discussion ==
Please use the ''@''SIG@ macro to leave a timestamp and your signature.

== What ==
We plan to have a complete community theme, suitable for inclusion into the repos as an alternative theme.
* This will be Ubuntu based.
** Will either aim for next release (Gutsy Gibbon), or possibly, next LTS.
   -- TroySobotka  I would think with a decent level of participation and this early start GG is reasonable.
* Should be a ''complete'' theme, no glaring gaps.
* Should follow Ubuntu colors loosely
  -- TroySobotka  As an aside, there are no real 'loose' Ubuntu colours.  Perhaps we could leave this sort of thing at a general 'warmish' feel?  Not quite orange, not quite dark brown, but a pleasant palette selection somewhere in that vicinity.  Note I said ''palette'' and not a monochrome mess.
 -- nothlit  Basically, I meant it shouldn't completely contradict traditional Ubuntu colours, and was mostly aimed @ the icon theme.
** Hopefully, we can have a different mood for each release.
   -- TroySobotka  Let's worry about ''one'' release first please.  ;)
** Should not be a complete blue, silver, or over-glossed theme.

== Items ==
'''A wallpaper, gnome splash, gdm theme.'''
=== Possibles ===
** isolinux splash, '''usplash'''
** Multiple wallpapers, GTK+/Metacity/Emerald theme
*** Should we take advantage of the changing those colors in gnome-theme-properties or something akin to the gtk color chooser? (edits gtkrc)
     -- TroySobotka  Can someone please look into the details of making this work with the theme?  Are there rules we need to follow?  Does ''anyone'' have a doc link on this sort of thing?  If not, we can only do what we know.
*** This could also mean transparent png/svg wallpapers--with colors defined background color/gradient.
*** The above will come at a sacrifice to the mood/pallete/concept that we may want to set, however it is something that would enhance the ability for the theme to fit the user -- something that may be fitting for an advanced desktop distro.
     -- TroySobotka  I think delivering a solid theme should probably take precedent over customization.  Although the idea of a completely translucent wallpaper is interesting, it is probably tough to reconcile it against the GDM for example. 
** An Icon theme--if so, this probably won't completely change from release to release.
    -- TroySobotka  This is a massive undertaking.  I would suggest that we should probably vote on an acceptable one already out in the wild that will work with our theme.
** Other Desktop Environments.

== Ideas, Concept, Motifs ==
* Some of these will have associative images as well.
* ''Feel free to attach mock palletes''
** It would be helpful if you could also describe your pallete, what sort of mood it gives and what you are trying to achieve.

=== Animal ===
'''Gutsy Gibbon'''
* To do with the spirit, and colors of the animal.
* ''Attributes''
** The gibbon is a great jumper, and a fast animal -- swinging up to 56km/h.
** The gibbon is capable, their wrist being of a ball and socket, allowing movement on two axes.
** Long arms, hands, and feet.
** Small, Black Face
** Some have: 
** A prominent throat sack.
** Comical? White fur surrounding face. Large fur.
* ''Colors''
** Reddish grey-brown, white, and black.
 -- nothlit  For "gutsy", I'd like playful gibbon, eyes and its motion, and dynamic poses being the focus. However, looking at reference images, its vulnerable, shy, cute side comes through as well. We could then concentrate on the small face, cute eyes and almost sad expression, all dwarfed by its voluminous fur. I envision: clean, sandy/brown based white {fur}, with ''small'' touches of dark brown(/black/grey) {Dark Areas, in the fur, and exposed skin}. One thing I'd like very much to avoid is those dark colored gibbons--they're monotonous, not good for a ui nor very calming.
 
 -- nothlit  These are some gibbon colors--not what I envision but some more general palettes, and a way to get a feel for gibbon colours.

'''Glossy Gnu?'''
* We could possibly do something with the almost-name, being an alternative theme.

=== Earthy ===
* Deep, warm tones
** A welcoming environment
** During all points we should absolutely avoid any closeness with fecal matter--brown can be a dangerous color

=== Welcoming ===

=== Humanity/Kindness ===
* Probably an overdone theme, and already central to Ubuntu... possibly redudant.

== Icon Theme ==
* This one probably takes the most manpower to be comprehensive.
* It would be especially nice if this meshes very well with other common icons, such as program icons, that would not exist in our theme.
* If we had a ''lot'' of manpower, we could probably attempt to cover common applications as well
* We could possibly fill in Human instead--this will probably depend on the direction the community theme wants to take
* Should be relatively neutral--and fit well with '''general''' Ubuntu colors, as this will probably travel from release to release, from concept to concept.
** If the general palette is relatively restricted, theres no reason we can't tweak the colors for each release.
== Proposal ==
** I think we can start from my <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/OranSun|OranSun]]</nowiki> theme not delivered with feisty. It also used with some modification from Mirco MacSlow Muller  -- <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lizardking|Lizardking]]</nowiki>
