Mar 27 21:22:02 toddc last time we were able to feed it to azloco.com blog but that was over a year ago

Mar 27 21:27:35 syn-ack If I can get things all setup, yeah tagumcity

Mar 27 21:29:12 toddc syn-ack a complete rebuild update is in the works already
Mar 27 21:29:22 syn-ack ah, ok
Mar 27 21:29:45 syn-ack I won't touch anything then
Mar 27 21:30:25 toddc shane is working on doing a class where we will new os update on both servers but waiting to see when he and devry can get us in
Mar 27 21:31:34 toddc I think they are on 8.04 ATM
Mar 27 21:33:32 syn-ack ah
Mar 27 21:33:53 syn-ack yeah, that's coming to it's end of life here next month, iirc
Mar 27 21:36:45 toddc I am looking for my shell on testazloco.com but that was a year ago
Mar 27 21:39:53 syn-ack I would need a vhost set up for it as well. I don't know Apache 2 all that well though
Mar 27 21:40:11 syn-ack something like presentation.azloco.com
Mar 27 21:40:17 toddc ok
Mar 27 21:42:23 syn-ack I went ahead and changed my account from "syn-ack" to my given name by the way which is Matt Eskes
Mar 27 21:43:24 toddc I hoped you would and then changed the password
Mar 27 21:44:45 syn-ack I need to remove my old user too so I'm getting that done as well
Mar 27 21:46:35 toddc able conf is planning on  a live feed of just the presentations but that may not happen either
Mar 27 21:46:46 syn-ack why not?
Mar 27 21:50:22 toddc talking it about it but not sure the person will follow thru but I am trying to get someone to be there for the loco that could if we can get bbb or???

Mar 27 22:00:46 toddc it linked to USTREAM  http://www.ustream.tv/channel/install-fest-from-uat---5-30-09 and in the blogs as 5-30-09
Mar 27 22:02:41 syn-ack yeah
Mar 27 22:02:56 syn-ack I think this is probably the quickest way to get it done as well
Mar 27 22:03:11 syn-ack I even mentioned it in the beginning
Mar 27 22:03:20 toddc ok
Mar 27 22:03:40 syn-ack It's certainly not two way, but it will get the job done
Mar 27 22:05:21 syn-ack toddc, using something like this, actually: http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcamstudio/
Mar 27 22:13:47 toddc I usually take a laptop and a netbook to installfests should  I go ahead and set up one ? then---
Mar 27 22:14:53 syn-ack sure, you wanna try it go ahead. You have any issues, just give me a holler.
Mar 27 22:14:58 toddc looked at ustrem needs a accountbut have to sign up to find out price
Mar 27 22:15:11 syn-ack They have a free one, iirc
Mar 27 22:15:14 toddc the other two look free
Mar 27 22:15:35 syn-ack I'll talk to Andy Taylor formerly of KLPX and see what he has to say about it
Mar 27 22:15:47 toddc do we want to get on azloco and how?
Mar 27 22:16:08 toddc ok I will seee how far I can get
Mar 27 22:16:45 syn-ack Well, if we can get into the server, we can install big blue installed and control the whole thing better han we can with ustream
Mar 27 22:16:58 toddc agreed </pre>
