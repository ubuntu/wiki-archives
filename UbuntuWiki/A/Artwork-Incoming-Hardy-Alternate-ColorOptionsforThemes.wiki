== Color Options for Themes ==

==== Concept ====

Update:  I pointed it to gnome devs and it was rejected.
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=497116

To make the theme more easily customized we can add an option for an "Accent" color.
The accent color can be for things such as prelights, active tabs, and progress bars.  Ex/ the theme posted below uses brown and orange.  Currently the orange is hard coded...

* This is a great idea and can open more useful customization possibility let's go for it. -- Szerencsefia 
* That's a good idea. Point it to GNOME devs as it can be implemented upstream. -- HenriqueFreakcode 
* I'm all for this too! Great idea! I'd really love to see this implemented in Hardy Heron. -- Socceroos 
* I completely agree! -- Mirek2 
* I definitely like the idea BUT I think the accent option and all other color detail options should be tucked into a sub-page. For all its flaw's, I really do like Vista's color-picker. You can still go into the nitty-gritty to change colors of specific elements (ok, maybe in Vista this IS buried too deep) but mostly you just pick the basic overall color using a sort of 'master control'. This master control is intuitive, simple, and doesn't really let you select colors that would cause any usability issues. Perhaps GNOME could incorporate something like that where you just have 'hue' and 'color' (saturation) sliders and GNOME automatically maintains an appropriate neutral tone? Maybe a slider to select the master color and GNOME automatically generates complimentary and contrasting colors for details and accents? Simpler is better for the end-user, but the average user still appreciates some customizability -Sumit
