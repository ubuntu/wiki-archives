=== Inspirations ===

This theme has been largely inspired by the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/DustTheme|Dust Theme]]</nowiki>, which I have had the pleasure of having my recent murrine modifications comitted to trunk.  

=== Metacity ===

The metacity is based off New Wave and should present a unified flow from metacity to menubar leaving a nice gradient top metacity. 

=== Issues ===

* Skype = Dark text on dark menu
* The blue colour of the nautilus "more" widget (the thing at the top that is shown in the trash) doesn't match to the rest of the theme. --benii89

=== Comments ===

* One word: Brilliant! Please make Hanso the default theme for Karmic Koala - the colours match perfectly to Ubuntu's new <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOJUY35N-pU|splash screen]]</nowiki>.
** Thank you for your kind words.  Please take a look at this blog post and vote unofficially <nowiki>[[http://beginlinux.wordpress.com/2009/08/28/new-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala-themes/|New Themes Vote]]</nowiki>.  I'm thinking about posting a forum thread or announcement to the mailing list as possibly inclusion into gnome-themes-ubuntu.  It was recently included in the community-themes for testing and so far, so good.  The community reception has been extremely positive.  As far as default, that is in the hands of Canonical.  The integration was coincidental up to this point, but it really truly is an amazing integration.  Thanks again. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dashua]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>
