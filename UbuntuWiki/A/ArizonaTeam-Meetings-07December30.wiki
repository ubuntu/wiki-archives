[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:26:06] <jameswf-home>	most of my non RHEL contacts are debian people who scoff at ubuntu..
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:26:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	jameswf-home: hee hee
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:26:29] <tyche>	I was right.  Asterisk is in the repositories.  Including in the Dev's.  There might be developers working with it in Ubuntu.
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:26:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	i like debian myself
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:26:40] <tyche>	Ubuntu IS Debian

[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:27:06] <tyche>	And the reason they scoff is because Ubuntu did it better, and with their tools.
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:27:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	well, everyone is scoffing at ubuntu these days
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:27:22] <jameswf-home>	ith like telling redhat centos is redhat

[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:28:05] <kennymc0>	that would be nice
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:28:13] <kennymc0>	but i doubt it will ever happen
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:28:23] <tyche>	I really don't care what distro people use, as long as they have the choice to get off of that "other OS"
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:28:40] <kennymc0>	yeah
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:28:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	ubuntu fills a gap by releasing every 6 months,   debian will never do that
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:28:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: agreed
[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:28:57] <kennymc0>	i cringe everytime i have to boot into the "other os"

[Sun Dec 30 2007] [21:29:29] <tyche>	Yea, but Debian benifits from it, too.  The packages that are developed for Ubuntu are upstreamed back to the source, and available for Debian.
