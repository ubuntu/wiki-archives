It was organised by Delfin Lend-Lease, a property developer, to launch their new comunity website. Ubuntu was invited to attend with give-aways due to previous involvement with the venue last year during Software Freedom Day.

Approximately 60 Ubuntu 6.10 (32bit,Edgy Eft) CD's were distributed, either individually or part of a 'showbag' which had originally been put together for the Ubuntu stand at the Open Day at Linux.Conf.Au Conference in Sydney.

Several other FOSS and Community groups were involved in this effort:
* IT Share - Demonstration Hardware
* Bettong.Org - Demonstrations and Training Information
* Air-Stream - Internet Connectivity

with assistance from local Linux Users
* Joel Stanley - Demonstration of "One Laptop per Child" (A highlight!)
* Michael Ritter - Demonstration Hardware 
* Geoffrey Bennett, LinuxSA 

Thanks also
* Melissa Draper, Ubuntu-Au Leader - Helping organise material, showbags
* Marilize Coetzee, Ship it - Ubuntu CD's, brochures and t-shirts
