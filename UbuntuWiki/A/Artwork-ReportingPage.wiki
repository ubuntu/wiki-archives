Artwork Team Monthly Report

=== Nov 2007 ===
First report from the art team, learning by doing!

* Decided on recreating art.ubuntu.com. Work on this has began, waiting for code review to go live with it.

* Restructured the wiki page to be compliant with the other team pages and added lots of info. Process ongoing.

* Lots of mockups and ideas for Hardy. Collecting all ideas and discussing them, mainly on the mailing list. Next stage is to get a firm decision and start work.

* Looking into creating a flickr group with assigned tags to gain new contributors from this amazingly varied and talented artistic resource.
