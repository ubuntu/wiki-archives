-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:OxKing]]</nowiki> Version 2 and 2b are pretty cool!

 -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:troy-sobotka]]</nowiki>  Sometimes less is less.  As much as I can't concretely cite the following recommendation, I'd suggest that the quality of a piece of work is directly proportional to an outside individual's ability to duplicate it and the time such a duplication would take.  Modernist minimalism, while all the vogue in FLOSS, is a rather dated notion.  Elevate your work with a complexity that isn't easily reproduced.  In particular:
** Is there a way to present the ibex in a form that doesn't echo a hasty trace?
** Is there something in the work that you could add / augment / adjust that would give it a particular stylized flavor?  What is the style of the piece and what are the earmarks of that style?
** Is there something you could explore that pushes the communication further?  What are you communicating?  Awe?  Beauty?  To whom?  Let those sorts of questions drive your work.
** Compositionally, is there anything in terms of proportions and placement that might make the forms work better?  Currently, the compositional elements of the three feel 'quarter', 'quarter', and 'half'.  Is there a more optimal usage of space?
** Consider adding a compliment or the starting point of a triplet to round out your work.  When seeking to present a tone it is common practice to use basic colour theory.  Further, creating a more balanced palette will give you options for bridging colour devices.  Don't succumb to the same folly that Ubuntu proper often lands itself in -- a monochromatic tedium.
 Keep creating.
