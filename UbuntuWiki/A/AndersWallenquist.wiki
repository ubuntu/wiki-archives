My name is Anders Wallenquist and I work as an IT-consultant in Sweden since the beginning of 1980th. Mandator (1983), Sigma (1994), Cell Network (1998), Kreawit (2001). I'm a Debian and more and more an Ubuntie! For Ubuntu I do as much advocasy as I can, I do some translations and my ambition are to make some packages ready for Universe. Right now TinyERP are at my and some fellow companies focus. I like working in networks and networking are the answer of virtually everything even how to
deliver local support thru all Sweden. Building a network of cooperating consultingfirms in Sweden, supporting Ubuntu, are the most challengeing goal for me at the time.
