== Notes ==

This meeting was an impromptu emergency meeting held to discuss the future of meetings, which had not occurred for 3 fortnights.

== Minutes ==

* Change the time when meetings are held?
** While we have <nowiki>[[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ubuntu.region.australia/1293|decided]]</nowiki> that Tuesdays are the best days on which to hold meetings, we have not re-considered the time at which the meetings commence. Meetings currently begin at 0900UTC, which is not ideal for everyone. We might wish to hold a poll to select the most appropriate time. - <nowiki>[[KarlGoetz|Karl Goetz]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[SridharDhanapalan|Sridhar Dhanapalan]]</nowiki>

   Action: Meetings to continue on Tuesdays with increased effort to make them happen. If things continue to dwindle, we will consider other options.

** Do we also need to change the time due to the end of DST? - MatthewVermeulen (MatthewV)

   Action: Time reverted to 1000UTC, since daylight savings has ended. Further consideration of the time will be discussed at the next meeting
