== Accounting on Ubuntu ==

==== Introduction ====

Ubuntu offers a wide range of accounting and finance applications for personal or business use.

==== PostBooks ====

PostBooks is a full business ERP system that can run on a standalone PC, on a network or on the web.  If you only use the Qt-based GUI desktop interface, then the only server component required is an installation of the PostgreSQL package.  There is also a web and mobile web xTuple ERP solution which requires a full web server and Node.JS setup but it can share the same PostgreSQL schema that is used for the desktop GUI.
