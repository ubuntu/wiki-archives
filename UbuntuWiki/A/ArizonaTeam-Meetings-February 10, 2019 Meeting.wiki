 04:11 <toddc> 1) I will have a cup of coffee in the morning and read my newspaper like I use to.

 04:11 <toddc> 2) I will eat breakfast with a knife and fork and not with one hand typing.

 04:12 <toddc> 3) I will get dressed before noon.

 04:12 <toddc> 4) I will make an attempt to clean the house, wash the dog, get the kids off to school, all before even thinking of the Internet.

 04:12 <toddc> 5) I will sit down and write a letter to those unfortunate few friends and family that are Internet-deprived.

 04:12 <toddc> 6) I will call someone on the phone who I cannot contact via the Internet.

 04:12 <toddc> 7) I will read a book...if I still remember how.

 04:13 <toddc> 8) I will listen to those around me and their needs and stop telling them to turn the TV down so I can hear what is happening on the Web.

 04:13 <toddc> 9) I will not be tempted during TV commercials to check for email.

 04:13 <toddc> 10) I will try and get out of the house at least once a week, if it is necessary or not.

 04:13 <toddc> 11) I will remember that my bank is not forgiving if I forget to balance my checkbook because I was too busy on my computer.

 04:14 <toddc> 12) Last, but not least, I will remember that I must go to bed some time....and the Internet will always be there tomorrow!

 04:14 <toddc> it might be there but always one last youtube vieo to watch before bed
