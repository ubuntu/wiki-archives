Oct 21 21:18:38 <johnc4510>	another hit i think
Oct 21 21:18:42 <tyche>	Seems a bit faster, too
Oct 21 21:18:45 <SloggerKhan>	Yeah, it runs very smooth.
Oct 21 21:18:49 <Polygon89>	it is
Oct 21 21:18:54 <SloggerKhan>	GUI responsiveness seems better.

Oct 21 21:24:36 <jsonder>	*can't type*
Oct 21 21:24:42 <Polygon89>	for a screencast?
Oct 21 21:24:48 <Polygon89>	or the guide
Oct 21 21:24:53 <johnc4510>	jsonder, that's good, we need to use those resources as much as possible
Oct 21 21:25:02 <jsonder>	No, I was looking at the available screencasts
Oct 21 21:25:18 <Polygon89>	oh?
Oct 21 21:25:24 <br24>	okay
Oct 21 21:25:34 <jsonder>	The straight text-driven stuff is pretty dry
Oct 21 21:25:38 <br24>	do you have anything to say about the guide?
Oct 21 21:25:52 <Polygon89>	ok
Oct 21 21:25:53 <br24>	yeah I do agree with that
Oct 21 21:26:20 <jsonder>	nope but I'll have an un-htmled page to you in 2 days if i can fit stuff in tyches system.
Oct 21 21:26:28 <tyche>	br24: I saw some of the stuff jsonder is talking about.  We may be able to just link to it.
Oct 21 21:26:29 <br24>	very good

Oct 21 21:27:26 <johnc4510>	about the ed team
Oct 21 21:27:40 <jsonder>	There is a lot of stuff available on the wiki
Oct 21 21:27:56 <Theou>	I'm not really up to speed on what they do.  I'll read the wiki page mentioned earlier.
Oct 21 21:28:02 <jsonder>	we should use what is worth while
Oct 21 21:28:48 <jsonder>	https://help.ubuntu.com/
Oct 21 21:29:37 <jsonder>	Where did everyone go to?
Oct 21 21:29:43 <johnc4510>	k, thx to br24  and the ed team for all the hard work so far     it's much appreciated :)
Oct 21 21:29:46 <johnc4510>	sorry
Oct 21 21:29:57 <johnc4510>	ok, next the server team
Oct 21 21:30:17 <johnc4510>	slofgren, is busy with family stuff tonight so i'm stepping in
Oct 21 21:30:39 <johnc4510>	server address: 12.159.65.83
Oct 21 21:30:52 <jsonder>	whatch where you put your feet.
Oct 21 21:30:56 <johnc4510>	we have a basic setup now
Oct 21 21:31:32 <johnc4510>	anyone wanting access to the server should email slofgren at    slofgren@gemail.com
Oct 21 21:31:48 <johnc4510>	he will set you up with basic access via ssh
Oct 21 21:31:50 <Polygon89>	any news on when we are gonna get a new hd? xD
Oct 21 21:31:55 <johnc4510>	no
Oct 21 21:32:06 <johnc4510>	but slofgren and i have been discussing it
Oct 21 21:32:09 <johnc4510>	and
Oct 21 21:32:21 <johnc4510>	we are going to get this one set up first then
Oct 21 21:32:44 <johnc4510>	image it to a new hd and see about getting that installed then
Oct 21 21:32:59 <johnc4510>	it's hard for us to get physical access to the server 
Oct 21 21:33:02 <johnc4510>	so
Oct 21 21:33:13 <Polygon89>	oh
Oct 21 21:33:23 <johnc4510>	when we do we want to be ready to do all of what is needed at one time
Oct 21 21:33:28 <jsonder>	john4510: should that be slofgren@gmail.com   ?
Oct 21 21:33:35 <johnc4510>	without interupting the current setup
Oct 21 21:33:40 <johnc4510>	yes
Oct 21 21:33:53 <Polygon89>	where is it
Oct 21 21:34:11 <johnc4510>	phoenix in some tech server facility
Oct 21 21:34:22 <paul928>	where's the server located.....physically?
Oct 21 21:34:33 <johnc4510>	but the lug is the one who has access
Oct 21 21:34:36 <johnc4510>	you see
Oct 21 21:34:45 <Polygon89>	oh
Oct 21 21:34:54 <johnc4510>	the delvry lug donated the use of the server to us
Oct 21 21:34:56 <johnc4510>	and 
Oct 21 21:34:56 <Polygon89>	hence the reason why it took so long to get set up?
Oct 21 21:34:58 <Polygon89>	ah
Oct 21 21:35:02 <johnc4510>	right
Oct 21 21:35:18 <johnc4510>	they are the ones with physical access to the machine
Oct 21 21:35:20 <johnc4510>	:)
Oct 21 21:35:39 <johnc4510>	so, we have to work through them at their convenience
Oct 21 21:35:45 <johnc4510>	but still
Oct 21 21:35:52 <johnc4510>	it is a good deal for us
Oct 21 21:36:01 <johnc4510>	free server access
Oct 21 21:36:01 <Polygon89>	yeah
Oct 21 21:36:02 <paul928>	maybe we need to buy a server? with our own access?
Oct 21 21:36:03 <johnc4510>	:)
Oct 21 21:36:23 <johnc4510>	paul928, that would be great    the problem is $'s
Oct 21 21:36:25 <johnc4510>	:)
Oct 21 21:36:39 <jsonder>	hosting costs too
Oct 21 21:36:39 <johnc4510>	ok, next
Oct 21 21:36:56 <paul928>	what does the ariza group need the server for?
Oct 21 21:36:59 <johnc4510>	this wk, i'm going to buy the domain name
Oct 21 21:37:38 <johnc4510>	paul928, we plan to use it for team support and helping to bring the lugs of the state closer together
Oct 21 21:37:42 <johnc4510>	and
Oct 21 21:37:55 <johnc4510>	anything else we can think of
Oct 21 21:38:01 <johnc4510>	down the road
Oct 21 21:38:10 <johnc4510>	back to the domain name 
Oct 21 21:38:22 <johnc4510>	we had already decided on
Oct 21 21:38:34 <johnc4510>	azloco.org
Oct 21 21:38:42 <johnc4510>	short and sweet
Oct 21 21:38:48 <johnc4510>	i may also buy
Oct 21 21:38:54 <johnc4510>	azloco.com
Oct 21 21:39:10 <paul928>	is it available? both of them/
Oct 21 21:39:11 <johnc4510>	to round out our addresses
Oct 21 21:39:14 <johnc4510>	yes
Oct 21 21:39:48 <Polygon89>	domains are cheap
Oct 21 21:39:53 <johnc4510>	so after i get them bought and set up we will be official
Oct 21 21:39:58 <johnc4510>	now
Oct 21 21:40:18 <johnc4510>	we need to start getting a front page going on the server
Oct 21 21:40:22 <johnc4510>	note
Oct 21 21:40:40 <johnc4510>	we are not going to use wordpress or drupal to start with because
Oct 21 21:40:53 <johnc4510>	our hd is very small in size 
Oct 21 21:40:55 <johnc4510>	so
Oct 21 21:41:19 <johnc4510>	we need to people with html experience to help in that area
Oct 21 21:41:38 <SloggerKhan>	css
Oct 21 21:41:46 <SloggerKhan>	?
Oct 21 21:41:51 <johnc4510>	yes   we could use css
Oct 21 21:41:56 <johnc4510>	the templates
Oct 21 21:42:26 <johnc4510>	http://12.159.65.83/~johnc4510/
Oct 21 21:42:28 <SloggerKhan>	I don't know too much about webpages. CSS is like a form of html, right?
Oct 21 21:42:40 <johnc4510>	that's what i used at that link to the server
Oct 21 21:42:50 <johnc4510>	SloggerKhan, yes
Oct 21 21:42:56 <jsonder>	cascading style sheets are an improvement
Oct 21 21:43:07 <johnc4510>	but i am kind of limited on my knowledge of html
Oct 21 21:43:09 <Polygon89>	css is easy to learn
Oct 21 21:43:13 <Polygon89>	its like html
Oct 21 21:43:21 <Polygon89>	and there are great guides on w3c
Oct 21 21:43:21 <johnc4510>	so i haven't gotten too far
Oct 21 21:43:42 <johnc4510>	ok, well, we need some help in this area so
Oct 21 21:43:52 <johnc4510>	i'm asking for some volunteers   :)
Oct 21 21:44:08 <johnc4510>	btw
Oct 21 21:44:16 <Polygon89>	help in what area
Oct 21 21:44:18 <johnc4510>	this doesn't have to be really fancy
Oct 21 21:44:34 <johnc4510>	Polygon89, at setting up a front server page for the team
Oct 21 21:44:39 <jsonder>	css for server
Oct 21 21:44:52 <johnc4510>	for the intro page
Oct 21 21:44:54 <jsonder>	a couple of templets
Oct 21 21:45:12 <johnc4510>	where we will link to other pages 
Oct 21 21:45:13 <johnc4510>	like
