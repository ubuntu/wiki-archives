== CleanWindowDecorations ==

A (hopefully) clean and clear decorator for windows blending into human theme.

=== Concept ===

I made this using the emerald window decorator that comes with compiz. The window buttons etc. I think need to be changed (I used ones from another theme and I dont think they really match). I think this is a nice clean base that matches the human colour scheme (if that changes obviously this will have to as well).

Hope you all like it! :)
