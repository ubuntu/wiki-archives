== SimpleDarkIbex ==

I tried to show the idea of an ibex without getting into satanism or heavy machinery. Note that non-brown colors are used :-)

=== Concept ===
So far the idea is based on a spiral of simple dots which should represent the horns of the ibex (the most interesting part, I think). The background shows how one could use browns and other colors...needs a lot of work, really :-)

'''Palette'''
Check http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Intrepid/Intrepid_Ibex_Palette_Review for the current version. Until now this idea is only roughly based on the exact colors.

* I think its pretty and has potential but what would it be used for? The shape doesn't fit with Ubuntu enough. Maybe for a splash theme? -- Brettalton  * I really like the colors. I think this would be great for a bootsplash. For example, progress could be indicated by the how completed the logo is. The design needs a little work. The design doesn't fit as either Ubuntu's logo nor an Ibex horns. I would really push for this to be the next bootsplash, as I can see a lot of potential. -- isaacj87
* I agree, this would be a fantastic bootsplash! I love the idea of the dots slowly appearing as it boots (So the user can see how much has booted). --LostOverThere <<DateTime>>
* As a bootsplash, it could behave as the progress bar itself. It could start by havig the center circle/oval appear, and progress outward, and once complete the "Ubuntu" name could appear. Each circle could flicker, or fade, or ocilate into view -- or perhaps have each spin or flip in-place as if they were disk-like shapes. I really hope someone tries to put a bootsplash using this together, it is really sharp. Ubuntu should brand each release with art like this... <nowiki>[[kolanos]]</nowiki>
* I have attached a different take on the same design. I think it looks really clean, i just softened up the centerpiece in my design. Great Job. <nowiki>[[SamV.]]</nowiki>
* I am liking this so much, I shall work on a GDM & usplash for this, great design! -/- Rugby471
