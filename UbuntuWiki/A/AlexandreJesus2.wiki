=== What am I? ===

My name is Alexandre and I'm from Portugal. I got married last year while doing my Master's in Bioorganic chemistry.

My first interest in Linux came about 2003, when my University placed a room with Linux in the chemistry department. Then, in 2004 i was introduced to Ubuntu by a friend who just gave me a CD, and said to try it. Since then my laptop has Ubuntu, first as a dual boot because there was no good chemistry software in Linux (at least by my point of view), and since 2006 as my only OS (and never looked back). 

Now, I see myself as extremely lucky because since Warty I have always done the transition to the next release without any clean installs and always in the same laptop (getting a bit old, I know).

Since the first time I have always been leeching the Forums and "googling" the answers to the problems that appear occasionally and it became time to start helping others. So, I registered in the forums in April 2008 (almost 4 years since using this OS) and in launchpad and now here I am. 

=== What I'm up to ===

At least nothing that bad.

* Trying to be a good participant in the forums.

* Translating to Portuguese everything i can get my hands to.

=== What to do in the future ===

* I plan to give to this community, at least, as much as it has given me.

==== Short term goals ====

* Have an average of two helping posts a day in the forums.

* Translate at least 10 sentences a day in Launchpad. When reviewing posts then 20 sentences a day.

==== Long term goals ====

* Leave a good mark in this great community.

== Testimonials ==
