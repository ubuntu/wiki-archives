=== Welcome to  Akshay's homepage on Ubuntu ===
Hi,

I am now an ex-fedora guy. Made a recent switch to Ubuntu and well, needless to say I am loving it :).
IMHO, its the new avataar of linux and its the linux that linux needs. In other words, Ubuntu is the future of the Linux.

I hope to be part of the community building it and making Linux on desktops and servers more and more popular and an alternative to other OS that people can effectively use at home and at work. (and not just talk about it :) )

My co-ordinates:
