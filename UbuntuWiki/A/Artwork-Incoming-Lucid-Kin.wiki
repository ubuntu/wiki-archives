== Kin (The Lucid Refresh) ==
''It's delicious!''
----

This is the Lucid refresh for the Kin theme that has existed in the community themes package for the last couple of releases. The goal of the refresh has been to tone down some of the colouring and bring the GTK component of the theme in-line with the most recent release of the Human GTK theme which it is based on. I hope you'll all enjoy the new rendition of Kin.

Currently Kin uses the Humanity icons but I think the Human icons from the gnome-colors package in universe look quite nice too.

* What about switching or integrating work from Kin_Dust into the update, or going much deeper into a more greyish territory?

I have been thinking of doing a darker version at some stage.
