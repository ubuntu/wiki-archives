=== Summary ===

* Find the easiest way for a user to enable multi-processor support.

=== Rationale ===

* Users do not understand that they need to install a new kernel for optimal performance.
* Installing an SMP kernel by default or making it easier would be advantageous for Ubuntu.

=== Use cases ===

* A user uses a new laptop with a dual-core cpu, and notices that the performance is lacking compared to other systems. The user has no knowledge that installing a new kernel will solve this problem.
* A computer lab administrator install Edubuntu, and notice that the server runs slow compared to K12-LTSP or SUSE Linux. The lab administrator is relatively new to GNU/Linux and does not know what a kernel is.

=== Possible solutions? ===

* Have an SMP kernel available on the installer CD, and install it by default, if required.
* Mention SMP support requirements in release notes and documentation.
