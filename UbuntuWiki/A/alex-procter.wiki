=== About Me ===
I've been using Linux and Ubuntu for over 2 years now and love using it and learning more about it. I live in Japan and am married with one child. I love to tinker with computers and am a huge Nintendo fan, but unfortunately don't have the time to play so much these days. I'm also into photography and flying kites.
