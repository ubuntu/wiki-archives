21:05 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche: is kennymc0 working nights??
21:05 < johnc4510-laptop> :(
21:05 < tyche> Yep.
21:05 < tyche> He works until 10:30 pm
21:05 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:06 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche tells me freenode no longer accepts Mibbit
21:06 < tyche> Freenode has experienced some abuse due to mibbit
21:06 < soldats> it doesnt its only webchat.freenode.net
21:06 < scott_ev> =1
21:06 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:06 < soldats> well its the accepted methods
21:06 < johnc4510-laptop> soldats: hey
21:06 < johnc4510-laptop> scott_ev: evening
21:06 < soldats> hi its ben a while
21:07 < soldats> been
21:07 < scott_ev> true
21:07 < tyche> So, mibbit has been cut off, and as soldats has said, has it's own web portal
21:07 < scott_ev> good to see ya
21:07 < johnc4510-laptop> yeah, i've been hurting so to speak
21:07 < johnc4510-laptop> scott_ev: thx
21:07 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:07 < soldats> i dont have internet now again the neighbor is paying it and not connecting it so i am not paying anymore
21:07 < johnc4510-laptop> ah
21:07 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:07 < soldats> im at a frinds house
21:08 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, we should probably discuss installfest for tucson
21:08 < johnc4510-laptop> first off, we need ideas for location
21:08 < johnc4510-laptop> please
21:08 < soldats> oscr would be my first guess as its the u of a computer resource center
21:08 < soldats> it may be worth it to ask them
21:09 < johnc4510-laptop> wonder if that's where we had the last one
21:09 < johnc4510-laptop> is that the computer lab??
21:09 < soldats> its right at the end of the u of a mall
21:09 < soldats> well its one of them
21:09 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, the one we had was off speedway in a building
21:10 < soldats> as you drive down university twards u of a its on the left
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> do you have any idea how to get it for the event?
21:10 < soldats> that or maybe somewhere at pima if you still have contacts
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> who to talk to?
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> i do somewhat at pima
21:11 < soldats> well the oscr has a site that has a board and mods and admins so id say try to ask there
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> the other idea i had was trying bookman's on east speedway again??
21:11 < soldats> bookmans is a shot as they have a lot of "free" thinkers there but imo a computer place would be best
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> soldats: so would i check thru the u of a website or do they have a dedicated site?
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> soldats: k
21:12 < soldats> i thik its oscr.com   or .net
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> k thx
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> let me look
21:12 < scott_ev> someone cantact lenards and ask him for help
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> ah :)
21:13 < soldats> oscr.arizona.edu is the site and it has a board i used to go to to help people so its worth a try
21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> looking
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, got it...and i'll contact lenard's too
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> thx
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> i would rather try one of the colleges again if we can
21:15 < scott_ev> yeah, I'm pretty sure Lenards would have some ideas
21:15 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, now date...we need at least a month of lead time i think??
21:15 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:15 < scott_ev> minimum
21:15 < johnc4510-laptop> so the 25th of july or the 1st of aug. ??
21:15 < scott_ev> cool
21:16 < johnc4510-laptop> sorry 27th of july
21:16 < scott_ev> what day of the week is that?
21:16 < johnc4510-laptop> sat
21:16 < scott_ev> excellent
21:16 < johnc4510-laptop> 1st of july might be bad
21:16 < scott_ev> yup
21:16 < johnc4510-laptop> too close to th 4th maybe
21:16 < scott_ev> I could make a sat, but not a sunday
21:16 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:16 < johnc4510-laptop> opps that's aug 1st

21:23 < johnc4510-laptop> caber is a telephone pole scotsmen toss
