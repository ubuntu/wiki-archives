[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:39] <paul928>	Can we write a novel next?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: excellent
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:51] <kennymc0_laptop>	that would be fun
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:52] <tyche>	It's novel that we're writing at all.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:54] <rsthree>	NaNoWriMo: gobby remix
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:59] <ianmcorvidae>	rsthree: lol
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:10] <rsthree>	;D
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	we can probably use this for a lot of different projects now that we know about it
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	it makes for great interaction of the team
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:43] <ianmcorvidae>	we'd have to write what, 350000 words if all of us currently in gobby were participating? :P
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:47] <ianmcorvidae>	it does
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:50] <tyche>	Yer all just a bunch of closit editors.  Hee hee
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:52] <ianmcorvidae>	great for notes on a meeting, as well
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:59] <ianmcorvidae>	closet?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	sure
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:02] <ianmcorvidae>	never.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:02] <paul928>	first time I heard of gobby
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	paul928: tyche and i just found out about it this wkend
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	we are now using it on the UWN
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:43] <tyche>	This is only the second time we''ve used it.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:47] <paul928>	gobby works very well
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	yep
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:56] <tyche>	Which gives you an idea of how intuitive it is.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:10:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, are we done ??
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:10:41] <paul928>	do you have to use the ubuntu.com server or is it also stand alone?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:10:45] <soldats>	guess linux is catching up to what M$ used to use
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:10:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	just leave gobby and it will save our work automatically
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	paul928: if you don't use it, we would have to have an alternative server
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:43] <ianmcorvidae>	I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to set up a server, but since ubuntu.com set one up, it's worth using :)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:48] <tyche>	Yes, and the program for the server is called sobby
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	i will talk to slofgren about maybe setting this up on the team server
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: right
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:21] <kennymc0_laptop>	that would be cool
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	ianmcorvidae: do you think the team server could handle it?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:34] Nick	posingaspopular is now known as eddieftw.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:37] <tyche>	And I can understand why it's called sobby.  that's what the sysadmin does when he finds out how much stuff can be put on his server
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:55] <kennymc0_laptop>	lol
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:56] <ianmcorvidae>	johnc4510-laptop: possibly; I'd say just use gobby.ubuntu.com, myself
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:08] <ianmcorvidae>	it's not like we're really doing anything that will need to be hidden from them :P
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:13] <paul928>	is gobby for text only?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	oh no not at all
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:23] <ianmcorvidae>	and that means we *don't* have to put it on our server, which is a plus
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:28] <ianmcorvidae>	paul928: probably?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:36] <tyche>	But you have to hand code whatever you do.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think so paul but i would have to look that up
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:49] <tyche>	We're coding wiki for the UWN
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:19] <ianmcorvidae>	I mean... you could easily use it for something like perl, python, ruby, html, so on
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:25] <ianmcorvidae>	since those are all, at the root, text
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:28] <ianmcorvidae>	really, any programming
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:30] <ianmcorvidae>	so forth, so on
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:31] <paul928>	so developers could (and probably do) use this for collaborating on code
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:33] <rsthree>	that absolutely would be brilliant for collaborative coding
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:41] <ianmcorvidae>	text is incredibly versitle
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:44] <ianmcorvidae>	versatile
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:46] <ianmcorvidae>	yeah, probably
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, we're all out
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	but remember
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:15:04] <johnc4510-laptop>	anyone can go in and edit at any time
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:15:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:15:07] 	 * ianmcorvidae will begin editing now that everyone's gone :)

[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:07:23] <eddieftw>	soldats: the ubuntu icon looks slightly out of focus
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:07:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	and tyche and i have found a very cool new open source tool
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:07:55] <eddieftw>	i guess the proportions are just strange to me
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:07:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	It's called gobby
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:08:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	Gobby is a free collaborative editor supporting multiple documents in one session and a multi-user chat
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:08:08] <eddieftw>	gobby rules
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:08:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, now what gobby is
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:08:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's a tool so we can all edit a text at the same time
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:08:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	and chat in the process
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:08:50] <eddieftw>	johnc4510-laptop: last time i was reading about gobby, it didn't support logging, is that still the case?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:08:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	about what we want
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:09:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	i don't know
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:09:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	but we can copy the chat i think
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:09:14] <tyche>	eddieftw: I believe you're right.  At least I haven't found it yet.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:09:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	anyway
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:09:34] <eddieftw>	sure that's one workaroung
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:09:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	if the group agrees i will show you what to do to use this tool
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:09:54] <eddieftw>	it's still a cool tool, im not sure if it's cross platform though
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:09:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	please voice your vote +1 or -1
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [21:09:56] <kennymc0_laptop>	sounds good to me

[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:02:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:03:21] <tyche>	definitely different
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:03:34] <paul928>	danp: Very little right now. I maybe opening a used car lot soon,
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:04:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol, i can't get them out of gobby
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:04:11] 	 * ianmcorvidae is in both
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:04:13] <tyche>	I'm still trying to catch up the log.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:04:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:04:32] <danp>	interesting
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:04:53] <paul928>	this would be so much easier if I had the chat and gobby on the same computer, I'm using vnc to monitor the chat
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:05:19] <ianmcorvidae>	haha
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:05:21] <kennymc0_laptop>	lol
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:05:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: are you going to copy and save the chat notes?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:05:51] <tyche>	I've got them up to the last one or 2 lines.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:05:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	k
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:05:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	ty
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:06:34] <tyche>	They're still going strong.  This is also the best turnout I've seen.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:06:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: in the newsletter lets try to punctuate what a great tool this is and how much fun we had using it
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:06:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:00] <ianmcorvidae>	lol yes

[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:52] <tyche>	It's novel that we're writing at all.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:54] <rsthree>	NaNoWriMo: gobby remix
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:07:59] <ianmcorvidae>	rsthree: lol
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:10] <rsthree>	;D
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	we can probably use this for a lot of different projects now that we know about it
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	it makes for great interaction of the team
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:43] <ianmcorvidae>	we'd have to write what, 350000 words if all of us currently in gobby were participating? :P
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:47] <ianmcorvidae>	it does
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:50] <tyche>	Yer all just a bunch of closit editors.  Hee hee
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:52] <ianmcorvidae>	great for notes on a meeting, as well
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:08:59] <ianmcorvidae>	closet?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	sure
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:02] <ianmcorvidae>	never.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:02] <paul928>	first time I heard of gobby
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	paul928: tyche and i just found out about it this wkend
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	we are now using it on the UWN
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:43] <tyche>	This is only the second time we''ve used it.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:47] <paul928>	gobby works very well
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	yep
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:09:56] <tyche>	Which gives you an idea of how intuitive it is.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:10:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, are we done ??
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:10:41] <paul928>	do you have to use the ubuntu.com server or is it also stand alone?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:10:45] <soldats>	guess linux is catching up to what M$ used to use
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:10:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	just leave gobby and it will save our work automatically
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	paul928: if you don't use it, we would have to have an alternative server
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:43] <ianmcorvidae>	I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to set up a server, but since ubuntu.com set one up, it's worth using :)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:48] <tyche>	Yes, and the program for the server is called sobby
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	i will talk to slofgren about maybe setting this up on the team server
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:11:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: right
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:21] <kennymc0_laptop>	that would be cool
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	ianmcorvidae: do you think the team server could handle it?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:34] Nick	posingaspopular is now known as eddieftw.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:37] <tyche>	And I can understand why it's called sobby.  that's what the sysadmin does when he finds out how much stuff can be put on his server
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:55] <kennymc0_laptop>	lol
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:12:56] <ianmcorvidae>	johnc4510-laptop: possibly; I'd say just use gobby.ubuntu.com, myself
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:08] <ianmcorvidae>	it's not like we're really doing anything that will need to be hidden from them :P
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:13] <paul928>	is gobby for text only?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	oh no not at all
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:23] <ianmcorvidae>	and that means we *don't* have to put it on our server, which is a plus
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:28] <ianmcorvidae>	paul928: probably?
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:36] <tyche>	But you have to hand code whatever you do.
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think so paul but i would have to look that up
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:13:49] <tyche>	We're coding wiki for the UWN
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:19] <ianmcorvidae>	I mean... you could easily use it for something like perl, python, ruby, html, so on
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:25] <ianmcorvidae>	since those are all, at the root, text
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:28] <ianmcorvidae>	really, any programming
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:30] <ianmcorvidae>	so forth, so on
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:31] <paul928>	so developers could (and probably do) use this for collaborating on code
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:33] <rsthree>	that absolutely would be brilliant for collaborative coding
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:41] <ianmcorvidae>	text is incredibly versitle
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:44] <ianmcorvidae>	versatile
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:46] <ianmcorvidae>	yeah, probably
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, we're all out
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:14:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	but remember
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:15:04] <johnc4510-laptop>	anyone can go in and edit at any time
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:15:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:15:07] 	 * ianmcorvidae will begin editing now that everyone's gone :)
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:15:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	meeting over
[Sun Feb 24 2008] [22:15:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	it was a great one folks  thx :)
