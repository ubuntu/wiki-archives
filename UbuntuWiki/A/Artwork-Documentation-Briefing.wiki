=== Goals of Ubuntu ===

* To offer a free (in both the economic and FSF sense), sustainable platform for commodity requirements with optional commercial support
* To act according to the following ideals (from http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/philosophy):
1.  Every computer user should have the freedom to download, run, copy, distribute, study, share, change and improve their software for any purpose, without paying licensing fees.
2. Every computer user should be able to use their software in the language of their choice.
3. Every computer user should be given every opportunity to use software, even if they work under a disability.
* Have free software break into Microsoft's majority market share <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1|(Bug #1)]]</nowiki>
* Improve the overall usability of free software within Ubuntu. Surpass Apple in the quality of the user experience. (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/23/shuttleworth_apple_challenge/, http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/162)

Consequences for themes:
* Only use fonts and graphics with free licenses
* Avoid fixed text, e.g. as part of wallpapers
* Take users with less than perfect motor skills and sight into account. However, users of average ability must not be made to suffer from the consequences of the needs of the impaired.
* The theme must support the notion that Ubuntu is a viable alternative to Windows. It must help in attracting more users.
* Aim at improving the user experience under combined functional and aesthetic aspects.

=== Key aspects of Ubuntu ===

* Ubuntu is an African word that can be roughly translated as 'Humanity to others', or 'I am what I am because of who we all are'. Read more about it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(philosophy)
* A strong, friendly and involved community
* A benevolent dictator for setting direction and making difficult decisions
* Some emphasis on translations
* Strong infrastructure (Launchpad)
* A history of brown and orange in themes

The consequences for artwork are obvious topics to pick up:
* Africa
* The word Ubuntu and its meaning
* Community, collaboration, support and sharing
* Unity, willpower
* All around the world
* Handling the heritage of brown and orange
