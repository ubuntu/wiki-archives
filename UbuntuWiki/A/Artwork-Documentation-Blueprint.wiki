== Artwork Submittal Process ==

'''  '''

----

The goal of the Artwork Team is to provide quality artwork in a manner which adds value to the Ubuntu community.

The objective is to use a flexible process which encourages inclusion, provides a recognition of effort, and facilitates collaboration to achieve the desired result.

=== Process Narrative ===

1. The process is a three phase approach (initiate, construct, release) and may begin in one of two ways.

** A member from the community submits a request to the "Ubuntu Art" list to have artwork created. In the context of this process the community is defined as Ubuntu and the following <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DerivativeTeam/Derivatives|derivatives]]</nowiki>. 

** `Edubuntu`
** `Kubuntu`
** `Mythbuntu`
** `UbuntuStudio`
** `Xubuntu`
** `Lubuntu`

** A member of the community or Artwork team submits an idea to the "Ubuntu Art" list as a proposal. This process assumes in most cases team members will facilitate their own proposals.

2. Requests and proposals are added to the <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-art|job queue]]</nowiki> waiting a team member to facilitate the effort. As the owner of a request or advocate of a proposal, the submitter must mitigate the risk the task may not be accepted by the team.

3. When a team member agrees to facilitate the effort the requirements and process must be documented. The process should define all tools with clear instructions on how they are to be used. A tool in this context is a web site or specific software product and it is assumed they will be available without cost to the individual. Historically tools have included web sites like the Ubuntu Wiki and Flickr; products like Gimp and Inkscape.

4. With a published and clearly defined process the facilitator may invite others to join by submitting artwork or performing tasks. The submittal process will be iterative with advice and approval given by the owner, mentoring and coaching by the facilitator.

5. Artwork tasks are consider done when the requirements are satisfied and/or the process is complete (viz. contest winner selected). In the case of a proposal, the community accepts or rejects ownership.
