=== About Me ===

My name is Aaron, I started my involvement with PC's with games such as DOOM, Quake I&II spreading from there. I am a full time student, I recently received my AAS. in Software Applications and Programming working with C++/VB/Java; I am currently working on my BS. in Information Security Systems. I started working with linux systems 4 or 5 years ago, I have used various flavors of linux from Fedora, Ubuntu, and the list goes on. 

=== Involvement ===

I was fortunate enough to have the privilege of attending UDS L Release for 10.04 Lucid Lynx. I was very inspired by the welcome I reveived from the community and the people that participated at the Ubuntu Developers Summit. I am currently awaiting assignment of a mentor within the BugSquad, I have also registered with the Testing Team. I am very excited to be able to give back to community that welcomed me and did not laugh at some of the ridiculous questions I asked or input I had. 

As my involvement within the Ubuntu Community grows I will add more to this section, I am very eager to get started and want to make a valuable and helpful contribution.
