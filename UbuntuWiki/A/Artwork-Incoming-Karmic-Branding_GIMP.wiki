 " Yes, this is in keeping with the ubuntu color paletette, but while is it very natural it also kind of dull. Everythging is just a bit "blah" and there nothing that really catches your eye with this splash, I've seen some good examples of distro specific GIMP branding (wish I could recall some of those at the moment) and think this one could stand up very well, but also needs a good bit of work. I think the words "Ubuntu", "GIMP' and "2.6" really need to stand out a little more. Keep at it, though, as I believe that GIMP and OOo are two of the most prominent pieces of software in Ubuntu and definitely need to carry branding of some sort. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:blueyonder64]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

I think a good way to integrate GIMP, the Ubuntu logo, and the warm color pallet would be to make a splash screen influenced by Leonardo Da Vinci. The Ubuntu logo could be sketched out roughly integrating the word "GIMP" as the signature. The paper could be a warm parchment. There would also preferably be a quill of some sort integrated in. The picture below is a rough idea of the style we're going for. Just thought I'd throw this out here to see what people thought.

* I can see where you're trying to go with this, trying to associate GIMP with a famous artistic style, but at the same time I;m not sure that the concept really fits. GIMP being more of a Photoshop type of application, it just seems to me that something like this would perhaps be more appropriate as a splash for a drawing program like Inkscape. But I would defintiely love to see some more mockups of your idea before making any further comments. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:blueyonder64]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

* I like this one. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jonathanharker]]</nowiki> * This is more professional and clean. But I'm not sure if GIMP needs a big and horizontal splash screen since its windows are small and vertical. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:popoi]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

The original didn't quite fit the color scheme, so I made a new one with the ubuntu colors. I left the old one on here though.

The font was the windows sans font. I made everything else from scratch using inkscape and the gimp.

Keeping with the Ubuntu color pallete but in a more eye-catching way. This is some sort of spin-off from the first proposal.
