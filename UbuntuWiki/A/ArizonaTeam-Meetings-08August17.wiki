[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:12:24] <xHans>	the Stammtische are just an excuse to hang out at a restaurant and talk, I think the TFUG mtgs are doing something similar

[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:19:11] <johnc4510>	i thought it was full
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:19:27] <johnc4510>	obviously not
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:19:27] <xHans>	johnc4510: it is, but it isn't
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:19:29] <johnc4510>	:)

[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:19:37] <johnc4510>	great
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:19:52] <xHans>	it hit the number that was supposed to be the max, but they actually have a higher max, so there are more slots
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:20:10] <johnc4510>	k
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:20:32] <xHans>	a few people dropped once they got email from the instructor making sure they know the class is OOo not some proprietary suite, so she went below the soft full as well
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:20:43] <johnc4510>	k
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:20:53] <xHans>	I think she's back over soft full, but she's definitely not at hard full, so let's stuff the class :)
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:21:06] <johnc4510>	lol
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:21:06] <xHans>	she also has a C++ class looking for students
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:21:30] <xHans>	I need more students for my shell scripting class that starts a week from tomorrow
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:21:39] <Paula62>	Xi-fans, have you ever tried listing these classes on Craigslist?
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:21:55] <xHans>	see my page for more info and please encourage people to support the Free Software classes we do have
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:22:18] <xHans>	Paula62: actually, no, I haven't, but that's a good idea I should've thought of
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:22:33] <xHans>	I did get a couple on the KJZZ events calendar
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:22:49] <xHans>	johnc4510: ok, that's it for me, danke

[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:23:25] <xHans>	johnc4510: I have broached it with them, I'll bring it up again once we have content on the site
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:23:37] <xHans>	Gutsy Geeks should gladly be media sponsors for us
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:23:59] <johnc4510>	ok, remember, they tape in advance so to get it on before the conference we need lead time
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:24:02] <johnc4510>	:)
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:24:13] <azteech>	what about using craig's list to advertise ABLEConf ... ???
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:24:38] <johnc4510>	actually not a bad idea
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:24:39] <johnc4510>	?
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:25:06] <xHans>	azteech: the funny thing is, I thought of that
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:25:19] <azteech>	lol, why not then?
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:25:20] <azteech>	lol

[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:26:22] <johnc4510>	to start it can be generic
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:26:25] <azteech>	worst they can do is kill it ...
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:26:29] <johnc4510>	rigth
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:26:36] <johnc4510>	Paula62: thx for the idea

[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:30:30] <johnc4510>	his contact said
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:30:50] <johnc4510>	a 6x2 black and white we could get free
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:31:02] <johnc4510>	color we had to pay for

[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:31:18] <paul928>	what's the approximate cost?
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:31:20] <kennymc0_laptop>	good thing about those though is that they would probably last for quite a while
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:31:23] <johnc4510>	soldats is pressing him to get us a discount
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:31:42] <johnc4510>	hang on i had the price    it'll take a sec to find
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:32:00] <azteech>	b/w would be okay ... color would be ideal ....
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:32:49] <kennymc0_laptop>	yeah color would be cool
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:33:04] <kennymc0_laptop>	and if we could get a couple of people to pitch in it wouldnt be too bad
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:33:08] <kennymc0_laptop>	just a thought
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:33:10] <kennymc0_laptop>	:)
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:33:22] <johnc4510>	arg, i don't see. but if i remember right it would be about 80 - 100 for a 6x2 banner in color
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:33:47] <azteech>	count me for $10
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:33:58] <johnc4510>	but like i said we may do better   if soldats can talk him down some
[Sun Aug 17 2008] [21:34:02] <johnc4510>	azteech: k
