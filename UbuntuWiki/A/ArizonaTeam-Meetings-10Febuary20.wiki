Feb 20 21:06:50 toddc puppet labs mcollective ( framework for similar commands on mutable computers) will be 11.04 archive
Feb 20 21:07:11 toddc LostPenguin has made some contacts at UofA computer sciences Dept for a installfest
Feb 20 21:07:27 LostPenguin yeah, just need to set a date
Feb 20 21:07:31 toddc  I took the liberty of contacting Dazed75 with plug to see they could help us since the more people we get to help the more we can help. And HE/they would love to help out so the next step is to find a date that most of us are free to help and see if Uof A can schedule that date.
Feb 20 21:08:00 toddc I wrote that befor I knew you would be here
Feb 20 21:08:13 sloggerkhan lol
Feb 20 21:08:15 toddc I would be availible most weekends that we are not doing the tempe installfest 3rd Saturday but conld miss the server installfest if needed. And am willing to drive my van there for carpooling
Feb 20 21:08:26 LostPenguin sorry I missed the begining new game came out this week --;
Feb 20 21:09:00 sloggerkhan I can probably do any UA event not during business hours on weekdays
Feb 20 21:09:23 toddc saterdays are usually the best
Feb 20 21:10:02 syn-ack Sorry I'm late.
Feb 20 21:10:04 toddc anyone have a date to put forth?
Feb 20 21:10:15 yourwhiteshadow for the installfest?
Feb 20 21:10:20 toddc yes
Feb 20 21:10:31 Dazed_75 I can make the 5th, 12th, or 19th
Feb 20 21:10:58 LostPenguin should probably take march to promote it and do it in April
Feb 20 21:11:15 kennymc0 that would be a good idea
Feb 20 21:11:24 Dazed_75 or the corresponding Sundays though that may not be a great day for it
Feb 20 21:11:30 kennymc0 dont want to do it last minute because attendance wouldnt be good
Feb 20 21:11:51 yourwhiteshadow what is the attendance like usually?
Feb 20 21:11:59 toddc I agree we need to the date out there
Feb 20 21:12:00 sloggerkhan if you do april, might as well do the 11.04 release, I guess?
Feb 20 21:12:05 Dazed_75 2, 9,16, or 23 in April
Feb 20 21:12:18 toddc last time we had 25-30 attend at UofA
Feb 20 21:12:35 syn-ack I'm currently putting together a talk for the Mountain View Computer Club here in Sierra Vista. I'm gonna try and recruit new users.
Feb 20 21:12:53 Dazed_75 I would not recommend Natty be installed at an April fest.  Too soon!
Feb 20 21:12:53 kennymc0 might be a little early to do the 11.04 release
Feb 20 21:13:02 toddc I do have to be there on april 16
Feb 20 21:13:54 sloggerkhan Beholdeth the macification of ubuntu...
Feb 20 21:14:04 syn-ack toddc, Be where? The UA?
Feb 20 21:14:23 toddc Uof A tucson
Feb 20 21:14:30 Dazed_75 Natty now scheduled for release on 4/28
Feb 20 21:14:47 toddc computer sciences dept
Feb 20 21:15:06 LostPenguin May might be too late, come up against finals
Feb 20 21:15:15 yourwhiteshadow it might be worthwhile contacting department secretaries, they are usually nice and send out emails
Feb 20 21:15:39 yourwhiteshadow we might gain some users that way
Feb 20 21:15:40 toddc we will need to post fliers and last time the computer dept promoted it on campus for us
Feb 20 21:16:09 LostPenguin this is my message:
Feb 20 21:16:11 syn-ack From the intel I did as soon as I moved here, there are only like 5 Linux users here in Cochise County so I figure if I put a good talk and presentation together I might be able to get a few to convert.
Feb 20 21:16:30 LostPenguin Hi Phil - we'd be happy to work with you.  I book the rooms and organize events here in the department so I'd be happy to help you find a space and advertise.  Do you work with faculty or our lab staff with this event?  Just let me know what you need and we'll help with the next event.
Feb 20 21:16:30 LostPenguin Holly B. Brown
Feb 20 21:16:30 LostPenguin Secretary
Feb 20 21:16:30 LostPenguin School of Information: Science, Technology & Arts
Feb 20 21:16:30 LostPenguin Department of Computer Science
Feb 20 21:16:31 LostPenguin Academic Services
Feb 20 21:16:31 LostPenguin 520.621.4632
Feb 20 21:16:32 LostPenguin advising@cs.arizona.edu
Feb 20 21:18:00 toddc UofA uses ubuntu on thir servers and recommends it to students and has/had a prebuilt VB version they recommend students use
Feb 20 21:18:11 LostPenguin so promotion at the U of A isn;t going to be much of a problem, I do want to make sure we cover Tucson and the computer shows on KNST
Feb 20 21:18:19 syn-ack nice to see someone not use RHEL
Feb 20 21:18:49 LostPenguin IDK if tucson public access is still around either
Feb 20 21:18:56 syn-ack afaik, it is
Feb 20 21:19:33 toddc so how much time to promote do we need mid april or can it be done sooner/
Feb 20 21:20:01 LostPenguin sooner in april we do it the better, the later in april the more has to be done for finals
Feb 20 21:20:21 yourwhiteshadow what do you guys think about craigslist ads?
Feb 20 21:20:44 syn-ack Probably not worth the effort, tbh
Feb 20 21:21:02 toddc I have used them before and they work well --I am on the linux forum quite often
Feb 20 21:21:08 LostPenguin if you want to do it go ahead
Feb 20 21:21:19 yourwhiteshadow also, are there legal waivers?
Feb 20 21:21:31 syn-ack There's no potential for flamewars?
Feb 20 21:22:12 LostPenguin legal waivers are in the software, it's provided free without waranty
Feb 20 21:22:24 toddc not for the installfest but craigs list forum is always a flame war
Feb 20 21:22:43 syn-ack toddc, That was my point in them not being worth it...
Feb 20 21:23:40 toddc so far we not had a issue doing the installfests and that would be a bigger concern to me
Feb 20 21:24:13 toddc but yes even with the flame war we could post on craigslist
Feb 20 21:24:16 yourwhiteshadow yeah, but if we're helping people install this stuff, there are always loopholes, best to have our butts covered
Feb 20 21:25:14 syn-ack Without warranty is generally looked as as without warranty
Feb 20 21:25:19 LostPenguin I'm not concerned about it, someone wants to sue me, they'll have to put me up in a hotel to do it cause my golf cart won;t make it out of Arivaca
Feb 20 21:25:27 syn-ack I've never had anyone try to come back at me wrt to that
Feb 20 21:25:53 sloggerkhan These evil people force me to install this evil communist software with no warranty! Bwahwahwhawhwhw.
Feb 20 21:26:03 sloggerkhan I don't think it's a big issue.
Feb 20 21:26:13 toddc I suspect that Uof A will have post and we will have enough students to both help and be busy answering questions that attendance will not be much of a question
Feb 20 21:26:14 kennymc0 in soviet russian software install you
Feb 20 21:27:35 toddc any one have a prefereed date
Feb 20 21:28:38 LostPenguin 4/2 or 4/9
Feb 20 21:28:55 LostPenguin should leave enough time for students to do finals stuff
Feb 20 21:29:29 Dazed_75 4/9 is the WE before taxes due.  Maybe not a big issue, but ...
Feb 20 21:29:49 toddc 4/2 then?
Feb 20 21:30:00 toddc 1
Feb 20 21:30:02 toddc 2
Feb 20 21:30:04 Dazed_75 1

Feb 20 21:33:40 toddc and we should on the flyers get a email for them to contact us so we get a idea of what type of install to prepare for
Feb 20 21:34:25 toddc last time they had us on the third floor lobby area that had tables outlets and desks
Feb 20 21:34:33 Dazed_75 Todd: will we need our usual stuff, or does the U provide some of it?
Feb 20 21:35:02 Dazed_75 Internet access?  Limitations?

Feb 20 21:46:17 syn-ack scott_ev, try putting the nick in there before the channel
Feb 20 21:46:22 scott_ev kk
Feb 20 21:46:49 scott_ev nope
Feb 20 21:46:56 syn-ack I know how to interface with GNUworld much better than freenode's chanservice
Feb 20 21:47:29 toddc LostPenguin can you set up the date with UofA?
Feb 20 21:47:33 scott_ev send a email to johnc4510

Feb 20 21:48:37 toddc 10am to 4pm but may run longer see if they have any time issues
Feb 20 21:48:55 yourwhiteshadow anyone have any home automation set up?
Feb 20 21:49:00 LostPenguin you sure 10 am is enough time to get people down from phoenix?
Feb 20 21:49:20 toddc as I recall last time they closed the building at 6 as we were finishing up
Feb 20 21:49:48 toddc better to have more time and 10 is when we did it last time
Feb 20 21:49:56 LostPenguin ok, I'll just have to make sure I hitchhike early sothat I'm at least there by 10
Feb 20 21:50:22 toddc we understand if your a bit late
Feb 20 21:50:58 toddc I will try to be there by 9:30 to setup
Feb 20 21:52:26 kennymc0 scott_ev: /msg chanserv op #ubuntu-us-az scott_ev
Feb 20 21:52:28 kennymc0 try that
Feb 20 21:52:41 toddc if they setup the date and time then we will need to make flyers and contact info and I may have someone to pass out those to libray and the other schools for us
Feb 20 21:53:34 scott_ev kennymc0: nope
Feb 20 21:53:39 toddc make sure to let us know if they have us in the lobby or a room so we can put that on the flyers
Feb 20 21:53:44 kennymc0 did a chanserv window come up?
Feb 20 21:53:50 scott_ev nope
Feb 20 21:53:55 kennymc0 weird
Feb 20 21:54:16 LostPenguin that would be awsome if you could do that so I don;t have to make a trip in to town to do it
Feb 20 21:54:17 scott_ev wait, it did
Feb 20 21:54:19 kennymc0 i was never given that power so i cant do it :(
Feb 20 21:54:24 scott_ev someone took away my rights
Feb 20 21:54:35 kennymc0 that's no good
Feb 20 21:54:50 kennymc0 then that means that no active people in this channel have ops i guess
Feb 20 21:54:59 scott_ev OK, I know only one person that can.  and ....  I'M DONE
