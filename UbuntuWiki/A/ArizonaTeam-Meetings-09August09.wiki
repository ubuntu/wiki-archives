21:29 < Jeff_Martin> they don't have to all be multi , tuxracer

21:30 < soldats> nexiuz is multi fps
21:30 < Jeff_Martin> yeah, and that Ghosts and Goblins redux would be fun
21:30 < johnc4510> SlickMcRunFast: any ideas on games for the server?

21:32 < johnc4510> ok, i have a question
21:32 < johnc4510> for all
21:32 < Jeff_Martin> we just need a place to download files from -- or you ( johnc4510 ) can put in the dvd/cds
21:33 < johnc4510> would it be better to have a LAN event instead of a gaming server??
21:33 < johnc4510> Jeff_Martin: i have no game cds lol
21:33 < azteech> we may have to watch bandwidth use ... if we do LAN event
21:33 < Jeff_Martin> johnc4510: people could give them to you
21:33 < johnc4510> ah good point
21:33 < johnc4510> Jeff_Martin: sure
21:34 < johnc4510> i was just hoping you'd keep track of the open source games we've mentioned :)
21:34 < scott_ev> I would seriously consider just having one or two games available.  we want this to be an installfest, not a game tourney
21:34 < scott_ev> haha
21:35 < Flakeparadigm> ha!
21:35 < johnc4510> ok, we almost have a location...once that's done we can do the flyer...equipment is provided...we have the CDs and the team banner
21:35 < johnc4510> scott_ev: good point
21:36 < scott_ev> we need to think about what else we want to have demo'd
21:36 < johnc4510> and getting the flyers out once they are printed
21:36 < scott_ev> xHans: would you be a speaker?
21:36 < xHans> scott_ev: for the Installfest?
21:36 < scott_ev> yeah
21:37 < johnc4510> scott_ev: can you ask the u of a group, or lenards, if they can distribute on campus for us if we supply the flyers??
21:37 < scott_ev> sure, will do
21:37 < johnc4510> thx
21:37 < xHans> I've lost track, what day is it?
21:37 < scott_ev> 29th if all goes well
