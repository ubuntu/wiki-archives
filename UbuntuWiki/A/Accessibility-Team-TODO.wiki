==== Done ====

We do submit our <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Accessibility/TeamReports | Team Reports]]</nowiki> monthly, so if you are working on an item here or have completed one, please add it to the current team report. This gives us documentation not only about what needs to be done, but also what has been accomplished by this team.
