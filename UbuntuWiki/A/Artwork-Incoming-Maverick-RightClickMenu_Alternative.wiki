=== Right Click Menu Alternative ===

Right click menu on icons - in nautilus - becomes longer and longer. In example, for a folder, there are more than 20 entries.

It could be difficult - especially for new users who are not accustomed with shortcuts - to realize simple actions like delete or copy a file/folder. In order to enhance interaction with icons, a right click alternative could be implemented.

=== Concept ===
The mockup below summarize some of these actions.

<nowiki>[[File:RightClickAlternative_tn.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
<nowiki>[[attachment:RightClickAlternative.png|Full size]]</nowiki>

==== How it works ? ====
First, when an element (folder or file) is selected, small icons appear all around it. These icons will help to execute very quickly some actions like copy/cut/paste, delete,  sync, send to, etc (these actions are examples and could be personalized). Available actions could be different between a folder and a file and even change with MIME type of files (e.g. Open with...). Right click should not disappear but it should be use for advanced uses only.

These icons could be considered as graphical shortcuts. Actions will be execute very quickly because it do not need a long right click menu and main moves could be easily memorized.

==== Touch ====
This system could be very useful for touch-screen because it is possible to interact with icons without using right click which is not available with multitouch.
