__TOC__

This page provides some stock responses to common scenarios in ARB application reviews. It is inspired by <nowiki>[[Bugs-Responses]]</nowiki>, the Bug Squad's archive of stock responses.

=== Content ===

==== Wrong license or proprietary license ====

This app was submitted with the license <license name>, but looking at your <files|website> it seems to be licensed as <other license name>. Please select the appropriate license for your app, and resubmit it.

==== Terminal-only app, with no graphical component ====

Thanks for your submission! Unfortunately, this process is only for GUI apps (in a graphical window), not for command-line apps (in the terminal). For more details, see our review guidelines:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Review/Guidelines

As a next step, you might consider submitting your app to Debian or the standard Ubuntu archives. For more details on how to go about this, see the Debian New Maintainers' Guide (http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/) or the Ubuntu Packaging Guide (http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/) or feel free to ask us questions on the app-review-board@lists.ubuntu.com mailing list.

==== App is too big ====
We are sorry to inform you that this app is outside the scope of the App Review Board. Our focus is on lightweight apps. We are generally looking for the kind of apps which could be reviewed for functionality and security in about an hour reading through the code. 

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages might suit you better.

=== Packaging ===

==== Submitted a source tarball ====

Thanks for your submission! We've created a simple walk-through guide in how to package an application to meet the requirements for this submission process.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Submissions/PackageQuickStart

Please follow these steps for your application. If the instructions are unclear at any point, it would help us (and other developers) if you ask us questions about what you need to do, so we can improve the guide. You can contact us by submitting a reply to the website, on the app-review-board@lists.ubuntu.com mailing list, or #ubuntu-app-devel IRC channel on Freenode. 

==== Submitted binary package ====

Thanks for your submission! Please upload your app to a PPA, and send us a link. You'll find more details on how to do this at:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Submissions/PPAUploadTips

And, an overview of the whole process at:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Submissions

If you have any questions, please contact us at ubuntu-app-devel@lists.ubuntu.com.

==== Submitted binary tarball ====

Could you submit this as a source tarball rather than a binary tarball? That is, bundle up the files before you run the build/install process, so we get the full source. If you have questions about how to do this, we can walk you through it. Contact us here, or on the ubuntu-app-devel@lists.ubuntu.com mailing list or #ubuntu-app-devel IRC channel on Freenode.

==== Submitted without build instructions or dependency information ====

Could you submit instructions for building, installing, and running the app? It looks like this will depend on the <package name> package, which is available in Ubuntu. The version of <package name> shipped in Oneiric is <package version>.

=== Running ===

==== Application touches system files ====

Your application appears to touch system files as part of its operation, however we do not allow apps to do this as part of a security policy for extras.ubuntu.com. For these applications, we recommend that you follow the steps on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages for submitting your package to Debian or Ubuntu.
