== About ==
My name is Augusto Cezar Amaral da C Silva and I live in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife|Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil]]</nowiki>.

I work as a System Administrator and Support Engineer at <nowiki>[[http://www.triforsec.com.br|Triforsec]]</nowiki>, and as a Linux Instructor at <nowiki>[[http://www.fuctura.com.br|Fuctura]]</nowiki>, which is an official LPI and Ubuntu Training Partner and where recently I've graduated as an Ubuntu Certified Instructor.

== Community ==
I've been deeply involved at FLOSS meetings and events organized by our local community, where I'm a founding member of <nowiki>[[http://pe.debianbrasil.org|Debian-BR-PE]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br-.org/UbuntuPE|Ubuntu-BR-PE]]</nowiki>, and have done some work with the Ubuntu-BR and Debian-BR L10N Teams.

Currently, I'm trying to learn with the BugSquad Team how to help with bug triage.
