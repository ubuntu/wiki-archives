=== Contributions ===

Significant contributions to the Telepathy framework, back then when I was a Nokia employee (working on Maemo/MeeGo).
Currently developing the Ubuntu Online Accounts framework and helping third party applications to integrate with it. As part of my job I've made sure that Online Accounts works well across all our interfaces (Unity7 and Unity8, including mobile); I've helped KUbuntu developers to reuse our components in KDE.

=== Future Goals ===

Contribute to every project in Ubuntu. :-)
