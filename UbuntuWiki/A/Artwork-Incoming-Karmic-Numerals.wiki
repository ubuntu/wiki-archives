=== Numerals ===

There's a lack of a nice free font or just SVG shapes for the numerals required to set the Ubuntu version number (9.10 for Karmic Koala). Using a font with non-rounded shapes works, but makes for a contrast where there could be more of a connection. The numerals of the Ubuntu Title font are rather harsh and too geometric. The <nowiki>[[http://betatype.com/node/36|Titling font]]</nowiki> has much better numerals, but at least the 1 doesn't satisfy me.

<<BR>>

Three different relative sizes come to mind: full height, a balanced medium and <nowiki>[[http://www.brightlemon.com/web-design/blog/?p=167|x-height]]</nowiki>. I used the Titling font here:

I then started to wonder if using text figures (also called old style) could improve the picture. Entirely custom shapes:

In any case, I would like to see a single solution for 9.10, on banners, posters, booklets ... (and never the Title font ;) )

=== Comments ===
* Nice topic started here. I prefer the latest version because it is aligned better and gives more significance to the year number. @ -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:ankere]]</nowiki>  @
