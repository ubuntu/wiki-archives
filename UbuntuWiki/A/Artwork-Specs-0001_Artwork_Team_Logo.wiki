==== Create new Artwork Team Logo ====
** '''Sponsor''': Artwork Team / JohnBaer
** '''Posted''': 26 Oct 2010
** '''Due''': 01 Feb 2011
** '''Assigned''': JohnBaer
** '''Packages affected''': Ubuntu Wiki, Launchpad
** '''See also''': 

=== Rationale ===

The Artwork Team logo is dated and does not support current Ubuntu branding guide lines. The desired result from this effort is a logo which symbolizes the essence of this team. Please remember this team supports the Ubuntu community which includes `Ubuntu, Edubuntu, Kubuntu, Mythbuntu, UbuntuStudio, Xubuntu, and Lubuntu`.

''Inspiration may be drawn from words like:''
** Creative
** Community
** Light
** Refreshing
** Bold

=== Assumptions ===

** The successful design will be created to displayed accurately on a web page and it is assumed the hardware will support a minimum of a 256 color pallet.

=== Use Cases ===

''Targeted web pages and uses include but are not limited to:''
** Artwork Team <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork|Wiki]]</nowiki>
** Artwork Team <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-art|Launchpad]]</nowiki>
** Links from <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Documentation/CommunityThemes|Ubuntu Software Centre]]</nowiki>
** Website "Favicon" 

=== Design Considerations ===

** Submissions must support the current <nowiki>[[http://design.canonical.com/brand/|Ubuntu branding guide lines]]</nowiki>.
** Submissions may be added to the phrase "Ubuntu Artwork Team" or "Artwork Team" to form the Artwork Team brand, i.e. the proposals should be symbols without text.
** Draft submissions will be accepted in "png" format.
** The desired format of final submission is "svg".
** Drafts should not resemble "Edit" icons.
** Drafts should focus on design (planned approach) over artwork.

=== Constraints ===

** Submissions must adhere to the <nowiki>[[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/|Creative Commons ShareAlike 3.0]]</nowiki> license.
** Attribution must be stated if the submission is based on another design.
** The successful design will render to the following dimensions and will need special versions for the smallest sizes:
*** For Launchpad: 14, 64, 192 px
*** Perhaps also: 16, 32, 48, 128 px

=== Workflow ===

** Post submissions to: <nowiki>[[http://www.flickr.com|Flickr]]</nowiki>
** Tag submissions: `UbuntuArtworkTeamLogo`
** Add submissions to: <nowiki>[[http://www.flickr.com/groups/uawt-1/|Ubuntu Artwork Team]]</nowiki>
** Comments and suggestions for improvements may be posted to the Artwork Team list ( ubuntu-art@lists.ubuntu.com ) for discussion and/or posted to the submission on Flickr. All comments should be constructive and adhere to the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code Of Conduct]]</nowiki>.
** The successful design will either be selected by polling the Artwork Team membership or by an impartial judge.
