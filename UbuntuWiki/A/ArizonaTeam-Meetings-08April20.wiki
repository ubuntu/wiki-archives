[Sun Apr 20 2008] [21:16:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	and at least 2 power strips i think
[Sun Apr 20 2008] [21:16:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	3 might be better

[Sun Apr 20 2008] [21:35:57] <tapH20guru>	question: are most phoenix folks going to the Metro Center party rather then red-seven ?
[Sun Apr 20 2008] [21:35:57] <SloggerKhan>	skype isn't hard to use, it's just slightly annoying. I think they even have a .deb on their website and you can create an ID from within the client.
[Sun Apr 20 2008] [21:35:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	headphones with mic works best
