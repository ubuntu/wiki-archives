[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:01:54] <tyche>	johnc4510 couldn't be with us tonight, because his mother isn't doing well and he needs to take care of her.  I know from personal experience what it's like to be on 24 hour watch and watch, taking care of someone that isn't in the best of health.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:02:01] <t00na>	oh noes!
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:02:08] <tyche>	Therefore, I'd like the team to join me in a resolution - That we hope that johnc4510's mother feels better soon, and that johnc4510 can have some rest and relaxation.  Those in favor, please indicate with a +1.

[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:03:08] <tyche>	soldats couldn't be with us either, tonigh.  However, he has been working on the InstallFest flier.  If you go to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=704786&page=2, you can see what he's done with input from others.  This has been a major effort, and we appreciate his hard work.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:03:22] <tyche>	ianmcorvidae has just recently added some comments, that you can see below in the forums.  He has been in contact with johnc4510 about them, and is in the process of making some changes to keep the amout of text within the space available.  He's put a lot of thought into the changes he suggested, and it's appreciated.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:03:45] <kennymc0>	very appreciated
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:03:53] <gunxfight>	awesome
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:03:53] <t00na>	Very very appreciated.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:04:05] <tyche>	What I'd like the rest to do is look at the forum post, as it is now, and keep an eye on it through the next week.  As new versions of the flier show up, let soldats know what you feel about them.  The forum is the best place to put your comments, but even in channel is good.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:04:26] <tyche>	Now, are there any questions?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:04:35] <t00na>	Any new people?

[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:05:01] <tyche>	Ah!  Sorry, gunxfight.  Would you tell us a little about yourself?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:05:02] <gunxfight>	lalalalala

[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:05:11] <gunxfight>	haha
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:05:28] <gunxfight>	i'm 16, male, live in mesa, and go to red mountain high school
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:05:45] <t00na>	That should be enough for the pedofiles that frequent here...
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:05:52] <gunxfight>	yep
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:05:52] <kennymc0>	how long have you been using linux
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:05:55] <tyche>	HEY!! Another one for central AZ
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:06:00] <gunxfight>	on and off for about a year and a half
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:06:04] <gunxfight>	woot
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:06:18] <tyche>	We're catching up with you, Tucson.  Hee hee
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:06:24] <kennymc0>	lol
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:06:32] <gunxfight>	lol
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:06:34] <gunxfight>	so what is installfest?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:06:41] <tyche>	Welcome aboard, gunxfight.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:06:46] <gunxfight>	thanks
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:06:49] <kennymc0>	yeah welcome gunxfight
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:07:01] <t00na>	installfest is the fest of installing
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:07:07] <gunxfight>	where is it held at?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:07:12] <tyche>	Installfest is much like what it sounds like.  Having people bring their computers to a central location to have Ubuntu installed.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:07:16] <t00na>	you bring computers, and people walk you through installing computers
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:07:34] <t00na>	er... linux
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:07:34] <gunxfight>	then what i read about it is correct
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:07:36] <t00na>	you install linux
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:07:50] <gunxfight>	any distro or just ubuntu?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:07:51] <tyche>	I'm not sure where Tucson is having theirs.  Phoenix's will be held in Peoria.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:01] <tyche>	We'll have the address on the fliers soon.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:03] <paul928>	preferrably Ubuntu
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:06] <t00na>	gunxfight: well the Ubuntu one would be just ubuntu
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:07] <gunxfight>	awesome
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:26] <t00na>	but if you just go to like a normal one held by a non-distro specific LUG, then anything.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:26] <gunxfight>	and how do you msg just a certain person?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:31] <t00na>	first you register
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:32] <gunxfight>	i see
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:35] <tyche>	That's the only one we'd have disks for.  It'll be (if I remember right) May 17, from 1:00 to 4:00 PM.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:49] <gunxfight>	ok cool
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:08:56] <tyche>	That'll be after Hardy Heron comes out, and hopefully after any critical bugs are resolved.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:09:11] <t00na>	If I do come (unlikely) then I'll bring my CD collection
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:09:19] <gunxfight>	sweet, i know a few people who would love to go
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:09:39] <kennymc0>	cool
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:09:44] <tyche>	Oh, great.  have you had a chance to see the draft of the flier we have posted on the forum?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:10:01] <gunxfight>	ya i just saw it
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:10:17] <gunxfight>	looks, good just needs more in the middle
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:10:23] <tyche>	You're welcome to hand out fliers once we get the flier resolved.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:10:28] <tyche>	And finalized.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:10:49] <kennymc0>	yep
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:10:53] <gunxfight>	i will
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:11:26] <tyche>	I know, from personal experience, that it will fit on an 8 1/2 X 11 inch page.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:11:36] <tyche>	It's easy to print.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:11:36] <gunxfight>	did we come to a conclusion on where to print them?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:12:51] <tyche>	I think many people will just run them off on their printers.  Some people are rich (>COUGH< not me >COUGH<) and may take them to Staples or Office Max or something.
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:13:22] <gunxfight>	lol
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:13:26] <tyche>	OK, anything else?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:13:32] <gunxfight>	my printer blows, but i'll still print some
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:13:41] <gunxfight>	nope
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:13:49] <tyche>	Any other questions?
[Sun Mar 9 2008] [21:14:06] <tyche>	OK, I call the meeting adjourned, and thank you all for showing up.
