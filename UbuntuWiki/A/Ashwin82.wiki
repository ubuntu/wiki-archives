Describe Ashwin82 here. I am new to ubuntu family, since one year iam in love with Linux, i have loved the concept of ubuntu, i thought what could be better social service than this. I want to contribute to ubuntu in a documenting way.  I am already working as information developer so i can make use of my skills here to develop and update documents.

ubuntu rocks, and i will continue to contribute to this family. I would also love to be a trainer for ubuntu some day.
