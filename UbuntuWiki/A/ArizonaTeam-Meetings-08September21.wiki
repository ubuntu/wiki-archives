[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:01:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	FernHans: your up bud
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:02:04] <FernHans>	ok
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:02:13] <FernHans>	first off, thanks to everyone for helping with ABLEconf
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:02:38] <FernHans>	the Ubuntu-US-AZ table was great, congrats on being well organized
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:02:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	and a big hand for FernHans
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:02:47] <FernHans>	lots of LoCo members helping out everywhere yesterday. Danke!
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:02:59] Join	Paula62 has joined this channel (n=paula@ip24-251-211-20.ph.ph.cox.net).
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:03:21] <FernHans>	several events coming up
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:03:28] <FernHans>	the InstallFest is now co-sponsored by Ubuntu-US-AZ as well as PLUG
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:03:38] <FernHans>	the InstallFest is the last Saturday of the month from 10:00 to 16:00 at UAT
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:03:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:03:48] <FernHans>	that means the next InstallFest is this Saturday
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:03:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	nice
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:04:07] 	 * FernHans probably just beat johnc4510-laptop to a headline :)
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:04:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	nah
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:04:19] <FernHans>	ASULUG has a big InstallFest two weeks from Saturday on the 11th, it runs all day
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:04:42] <FernHans>	ASULUG does a great job on their InstallFests
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:05:01] <FernHans>	they only go twice a year and ASULUG is glad to have lots of help
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:05:04] <FernHans>	the same day is the first Hackfest, a 3 hour security lab
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:05:11] <FernHans>	Hackfest will be at UAT from noon until 15:00
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:05:24] <FernHans>	a shame that the two events are the same day, but I think it's going to have to stay that way :(
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:05:40] <FernHans>	any questions on those items?
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:05:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	i thought zach was going to work with you on that
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:05:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	i have one
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:05:53] <FernHans>	johnc4510-laptop: we talked last night
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:06:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	if it's ok, we'd like to send a thx to UAT from our team too.
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:06:18] <FernHans>	both have been advertising and planning for a while, so it's a little late to change the day
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:06:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	we would need your contact email addy
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:06:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:06:53] <FernHans>	I thought about moving the HackFest to ASU, but there are practical problems with that
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:07:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:07:04] <FernHans>	johnc4510-laptop: ok
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:07:15] <FernHans>	I'll get you contact info for Liz
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:07:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	we figured the more thx the better
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:07:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:07:56] <FernHans>	so the InstallFest and HackFest being on the same day is a good example of why we need a combined calendar as Bill asked about
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:07:58] <FernHans>	and as you've suggested several times
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:08:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	FernHans: about that
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:08:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	we talked to david at the conf
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:08:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	we have a server they donated to us
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:08:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's small but could handle all of the conf planning etc
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:08:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	if you're interested
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:09:08] <FernHans>	johnc4510-laptop: ok
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:09:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	and could handle calendar too
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:09:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	we could set it up exclusively for conf work
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:10:03] <FernHans>	johnc4510-laptop: ok
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:10:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	k
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:10:49] <FernHans>	I'm probably going to keep my DreamHost account anyway, we could run tons of stuff off that
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:10:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	sure
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:11:19] <FernHans>	getting a combined calendar up is the key
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:11:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	k
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:12:02] <FernHans>	ok, I'm done and done :)
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:12:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	FernHans: thx

[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:32:04] <calimer>	but they still might have probs
[Sun Sep 21 2008] [21:32:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	smaller, but better than the one we have
