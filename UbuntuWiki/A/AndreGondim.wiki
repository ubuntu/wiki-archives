Been involved with Open Source since 2000, and more especifically with the Brazilian community since May 2005.  Started as a translator for the Brazilian Team and recently approved in Team on 28th in September. 

I met <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OgMaciel|Og]]</nowiki> and he calls me to know how to help in translations, since I get my free time to do this, I´m in <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+topcontributors|Top Contributors]]</nowiki>. 

About 2007 i become Ubuntu Member and in 2008 Brazilian Translator Administrator.

== Working on ==

* Helping <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/MaverickPacotes|MaverickPacotes]]</nowiki> - a reference to the remaining packages to translate until the Maverick Release

== What next? ==

* Completely finish the translation effort to pt_BR by the end October, and waiting next release to work.
* Involve more people in the translation process, and help the novice´s user.
* Involve more people in the review translation process, and explain how to do the correct things.
* Get more involved with the Rosetta team, so as to provide important feedback and help Rosetta become more userfriendly, specially for people performing administrative tasks within their groups!

One big interest for me right now is the Ubuntu Students team I co-founded a couple months ago.
