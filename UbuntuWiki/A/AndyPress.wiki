As part of <nowiki>[[UKTeam/IdeasPool/UK_Podcast_Transcription|Ubuntu-UK's effort to transcribe the Ubuntu UK Podcasts]]</nowiki> I have transcribed the first 10 minutes of Episode 6. (<nowiki>[[attachment:uupc_s01e06_low.trs|.trs]]</nowiki>|<nowiki>[[attachment:uupc_s01e06_low.html|HTML]]</nowiki>|<nowiki>[[attachment:uupc_s01e06_low.txt|text]]</nowiki>).

The HTML is automatically generated by Transcribe. The text is generated by Transcribe and then edited to insert blank lines between speakers and to wrap long line. At present the HTML has no links to the things mentioned. Apologises if I spelt anyone's name wrong.
