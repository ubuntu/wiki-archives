== Design Problem ==

Currently we reward every single action with a trophy, the trophy cabinet gets full very quickly and the very idea of a trophy looses it’s sparkle/value.

When you’ve just accomplished your 100th ask ubuntu posting, you don’t really value a trophy for your first post.

== Proposed Solution ==

Looking at Ask Ubuntu (and other reward based sites) I came to the conclusion that rewards should be staggered and that your score in any one category should be aggregated into a finale trophy / reward visualisation.

These basic categories are not a total substitution for a list of items which have been accomplished. But they are markers and rewards for accomplishing many or hard things.

This design is to aid the visualisation of progress and accomplishment in a given category such as 'Ubuntu User' or 'Supporter'.

With this representation of your accomplishments, it’s easy to see that you’re an awesome Ubuntu User, but you have lots of things you could do to get the full 3 star trophy for support. Each category of accomplishments can neatly fit in without creating more graphics for certain branding.

== Comments ==

* If "a three star cup is better than a 2 star cup" or "a trophy is better than a shield", then we've lost the intent of the Accomplishments project.  It's not supposed to rank members of the community, it's supposed to be emblems of personal achievement.  I do like the idea of breaking up the monotony of similar icons, just not based on ranking.  Instead I'd love to see the artists/designers come up with a collection of base icons representing trophies, cups, medals, certificates, plaques, etc, that accomplishment script writers can use to represent their achievements.  Right now everything is based off the trophy silhouette because that was the only icon we had readily available. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mhall119]]</nowiki>
