=== About Me ===

My name is Weston Miller, I'm married with one child, live in Texas (USA) and I have been using Ubuntu since Feisty. My main motivation for switching my primary OS to linux was the open source movement, and I was tired of giving certain multibillionaires money they didn't need. I had assisted very little with a religious repackage of Ubuntu but just recently started my actual work with bettering Ubuntu.

=== Contributions Summary ===

* Member of the <nowiki>[[Bug Squad]]</nowiki> for Ubuntu bug management
* Worked on resolving a few simple bugs here and there

==== Plans and ideas for the near future ====
* Learning the packaging system with a focus of joining <nowiki>[[MOTU]]</nowiki>
* Working to get some significant Python experience before assisting with python bugs
