'''This Page Is A Work In-Progress'''

'''For developers'''

Add a new entry in the "Request list" below, and link to the bug in Launchpad. If you want to provide a more in depth design spec, create a new wiki page where you specify the type of graphic you need and any details (design suggestions, url to project website etc), and contact info (email and irc are good) so an artist/designer can get in contact with you if there's any information they need to create the graphics.

'''For artists''' 

Pick a request you want to work on, add your name to it and change the status from Open to Work in progress. When the task is done you can mark it as done.

'''More opportunities'''

Additional artwork requests can be found by searching the "needs-artwork" tag in Launchpad:

 https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=needs-artwork
