This is the place to comment on the Kubuntu theme for Edgy Eft.

== Extent ==
We've updated the theme for Knot3 (Usplash, Desktop, KDM, Window Deco, Color Scheme, etc.)

There are still a couple of open issues on the todo list, like adjusting the amarok theme to fit with the current color scheme, including a metabar theme, and perhaps most importantly, pointing the ksplash theme to the correct background pic. The Usplash theme included was created before I could actually test it on my machine, so it definitely needs more love :-)

Other thinks like updating the throbber and tweaking the about page (again) will be done depending on time.
 
=== Response ===
Since Knot3 has a blue-purple feeling instead of the bronze-purple from Knot2 I am moving the comments from Knot2 to a section called "Knot2 Comments".

=== Beta1 Comments ===
* The new artwork is superb.  Great work friends.  :D

* I have an important concern about the KDM login screen in Edgy.  The menu icon (to the left of the username and password fields) is very...cryptic?  It is completely unobvious what it does, or that it's even something a user should click on.  I'm not a newbie, so I naturally clicked it, figuring it was the menu; but a new Kubuntu or Linux user might not ever realize it's clickable, and might think that they have to log in before they can do something like reboot the computer or shut it down.  I think that it should at least be labeled "Menu", or maybe "System Menu", probably with a down arrow next to it to indicate that it's a drop-down menu.  (Really, I'm all for KDE and KDM, but I do like the way the GDM theme has always had the simple bar at the bottom with the date, time and shut down/reboot options.  Is there some way that could be done in KDM?  Can KDM themes do that?)

* I noticed the new artwork of Beta 1's... well... it's VERY professional :D I like it, you guys did a great job. I can't wait to try it out :) I still have 2 suggestions... 1: can you put a Kubuntu logo on the wallpaper in a corner or somewhere? 2: what's your opinion about QtCurve or Polyester? Adding a little gloss would be a good thing (not max gloss, just a normal ammount) :) - JohnnyLevai

* I think it looks incredible. The only things that catch my attention are the icons, and as JohnnyLevai mentioned above, Polyester would be good.

* I think the new kdm theme looks awesome! Also, is it possible to get the boot splash to match the kdm theme, so that it seems as if it loads with the progress bar, and once it loads, the username and password box just appear? Cheers guys... top job! - Abhinay

* Congratulations on the kubuntu artwork so-far -- great work! I would like to see the glossy titlebar to look a bit more subdued though. If you look at the default Ubuntu theme - the tilebars are glassy, but its very subtle.
** ^^ @JohnnyLevai ^^ -- As for the wallpaper, I'd prefer not to see any logos on it. Its just adds visual clutter and looks tacky imho :-).  
** I'm pleased that the colour-scheme is moving away purple and gold. There was nothing wrong with that idea, but the constraints of the blue icon theme made it look out of place. - <nowiki>[[David416]]</nowiki>

* Great work - it looks really professional. I still have minor issue with <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/40821|bug 40821]]</nowiki>, as you can on this <nowiki>[[http://librarian.launchpad.net/4564126/060930_205555.jpg|photo]]</nowiki>, input fields overlap with enter icon. -- LukaRenko 
* I appreciate what you've done so far - great job! What I can suggest is to change the USplash a bit: personally I'd shrink the space between the Kubuntu logo and the progress bar - it's too big I think. It might be a good idea to put it directly under the logo I mean under the kubuntu caption, just next to the kubuntu logo. I find the background could be more attractive - I don't like the current of black - it resembles Windows XP bootup screen too much I think, and it doesn't match the kdm theme, which is nice in my opinion. As it was mentioned above, I'd also use polyester by default - It would make edgy look simply amazing! I'd be also pleased to see your logout screen proposal in the final release - i think it rocks. <nowiki>[[Shade]]</nowiki>

* The artwork looks great, thanks for the great work.  My suggestions are:
** If you intend to use plastik as the default style, perhaps you could use lipstik with 'Plastik Gradients' checked and 'Draw Status Bar Contours' unchecked.  This would clean up the busy looking boxes on the status bars at the bottom of each app and everything would otherwise look the same. (Set the 'Slider Handle Size' to Small to get the same sliders as in plastik)
** Agree with David416 about subduing the glossiness on the window titlebars just a bit.  For lighter color schemes (like the inactive windows for example) the glossiness pushes through the title text just enough to make it just a little bit distracting.  Not much;  just a bit.  The buttons look great though!
** For many apps, consider using varying font sizes for different elements to control spacing, layout and emphasis.  Many of the recent KDE usability items as well as GNOME and some commercial OSes do this.  Notice the recently added kicker tool tips, many recent GNOME apps and dialog boxes and, of course, screenshots from some commercial OSes to see what I mean.  Constant size fonts throughout the app can contribute to making the app look flat and cluttered because most things appear to be of similar importance.  The result can be that the user's eye ends up unnecessarily searching.  Different font sizes and weight creates spacing and emphasis to draw the eye to specific areas, separate elements of varying importance/relevance, and groups elements of similar importance/relevance.  (This is graphic design basics so much the same applies to graphic elements as well). - <nowiki>[[Jamboarder]]</nowiki>

* It was proposed before, but I find it's worth to remind, and it would be bad to miss the idea. I think it would be really great to use some of these, don't you think ?  http://evhart.online.fr/index.php/2006/09/18/ma-knot3-my-knot3/lang-pref/en/ what do you guys think about it ? I think it rules :) GREETZ

* Love the new artwork. Lots of polish, and very well done. Blue-purple color scheme blend is a great improvement. One more thing - <nowiki>[[Kubuntu Icons]]</nowiki> and it's respective entry in Launchpad indicate that spec is "implemented", but I have yet to see a kde-icons-oxygen package available on the repos yet. Will it really make it into Edgy, or was that a mistake of some kind? -- <nowiki>[[Nael Masood]]</nowiki>

=== Knot3 Comments ===
* The wallpaper in Knot 3 has been improved a lot.  But the buttons in the window titlebars have to be made cleaner.  The color scheme is also way too dark.  A lighter color scheme and clearer window decorations would be really good.  Also reduce the amount of purple used for window decorations.

* The Edgy artwork is much better than I expected. I honestly expected straight blue and purple was a good look. While I know it is controversial (maybe someone can get a poll going) but this release is Edgy. Its not about pushing the envelope necessarily, but opening up to something new. This style is new and I hope to see KDE moving away from the static blue. Blue may be classic KDE (and one of my favorite colors) but to limit one's self to blue only would be taking away many option is developing. My only wish is to get more colors, icons, window decorations etc installed when the system is installed. *nix is supposed to be about choice and I don't feel like I have many customization options off the bat. Sure there is kde-look.org however, I don't see the average user going to look for custom icon sets, but I can see the average user requesting this. Also. the panel needs to be overhauled, there are all of six things that one can do out the box for the panel.
 
* The wallpaper is much improved; tolerable, even.  :)  However I still think the purple title bars and selection color are too purple.  I understand the desire to make Kubuntu unique, but you still need to consider that purple is not anywhere near a neutral color.  I think it would be great to provide several themes for the user to choose upon installation, and if purple is one of the choices, great.  But in my opinion, purple should never be the default theme, at all.  You risk alienating too many people.  Remember, first impressions can do a lot of good, or a lot of harm.  Imagine walking into a motel room and finding that the wallpaper was purple, the bed was purple, the bathroom fixtures were purple, etc.  If you're a person that really likes purple, great.  But if not, you'll probably hate it and want to get a different room.  That's why motels use relatively neutral colors that have wider appeal (or at least, tolerance).  I'm not saying Kubuntu should be beige and off-white, but it definitely needs to have decently wide appeal by default.

* I'd consider the existing purple-theme a no-go. It may be edgy, but less so in an innovative rather than a provocative sense. Personally I dare not show Kubuntu to anyone using the current theme. Especially the amaroK-theme is much too intense. I was very excited when Kubuntu (together with Ubuntu) started for an orange theme with dapper, but then it was plain old blue again. Now Ubuntu changes back to more brown with some blue-ish hues and Kubuntu becomes purple. *sigh* Even my wife’s first word after seeing the new purple theme was “corny”. So, dear developers, we really appreciate your efforts to create something new and innovative but PLEASE change the current theme to something less provocative, lest the first thing the majority of users will do is to change the theme.

[EDIT: Moved the comment to this section, since it applies to the new blue-ish theme, not the old gold-ish one. Just for the record I'd like to add, that event though I still don't like the new theme, it's a vast improvement to the old one.]

* I like the new blueish look, maybe Amarok could be a little "blue-er". Will there be a "Shutdown screen from MHB" and Qtcurve? If you add Qtcurve it would be a nice idea to set it to Dull Glass. Will we have the cool Oxygen icon set? Will there be a Kubuntu logo and name on the wallpaper? That would be nice to :) - JohnnyLevai

* Man, Kubuntu's looking good! Excellent job everyone, and the new gradient on the window border is...well...interesting! Still, it would look a bit nicer if we had a glossy panel, colorized to match... All it needs now is a new Kmenu border, and a shutdown screen! ''/me goes to work on some new artwork'' ~Viper550

* This colour scheme is looking very very good indeed! I do think that we need a new style(polyester). Other than that, its looking amazing guys... Keep up the good work! - Abhinay

* The new color set is better but way too purple, i approve the fact that blubuntu is pro. I think that purple is too "amateurish" even with the little addition of blue it looks like weird.... especially amarok and the top of my windows. 

* Good work  it is better than knot2, but the color set need to be more contrasted (it is too pale) by introducing another color for exemple. Grey is too sad for the widgets. And please, use another icon set and widget style. - EvHart
** I have just made a simple/clean theme, see here: http://evhart.online.fr/index.php/2006/09/18/ma-knot3-my-knot3/lang-pref/en/

* Hello, I'd like to see another icon theme, like nuvox or nuovext, but different from Crystal! Another thing, in Firefox the form items (radio buttons, buttons, checkboxes are not nice to see, why don't you use a new form theme, like the one described here?  http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-83855.html I'm sorry for my english but i'm Italian ^_^ Alexic

* After playing with Knot3 this weekend I must say: good work. The theme is friendly to the eye (at least for my eyes) and the purple is visible but no longer predominant. I sevond Viper 550's and EvHart's ideas about adding more contrast and glossyness (I guess those effects vanished with the purple), though EvHarts design is a bit too dark for my taste.It's very close to the new ubuntu-theme but I like the friendly bright colors in the KubuntuKnot3-theme better. Also the borders of the logo on the login screen could be a bit finer. I don't know, whether the pencil used for the borders the logo and the word "kubuntu" are the same breath, but the borders on the logo look much broader and make it look dark. -Sokraates
** I added a brighter version with a ''really'' purple background, you can see it at the same address. - EvHart
** Now THATS purple. Guess Prince will be singing inside my head all day now. Could you do a version using a brighter blue using the Knot3 pallette as an orientation (since that blue is a bit purplish and using blue-only would probably lead us back to the Dapper-design)? 
=== Knot2 Comments ===

* I would suggest to have more than one default theme - some application near to a enhanced KPersonalizer should be forced to be run on first KDE start to give the user the option to let the desktop adapt to their preferences. This could include usage of apps like Superkaramba or kbfx, various kicker backgrounds, color schemes, KDM themes, etc.. This would prevent users from saying Kubuntu is by default ugly. So what, they defined the default by themselves. Concerning the new colors.. I find them ugly, sorry to say that. That violet, which was suggested in the suggestions was rather beautiful - but this purple scheme kinda shocks me =( I would strongly suggest to either give the user more than just one default desktop or change the default.

* I hate the new color scheme of Edgy Knot2.  Dapper's blue was cool.  Purple is not the color with a refined look.  It pulls down the overall image of Edgy.  If at all Kubuntu wants to diverge from the KDE colors, it should go for SUSE's green or Ubuntu's brown.  In my opinion, it would be best to stick to the color scheme of Dapper.  It was soothing to the eyes.  If at all Kubuntu wants its users to customize the distro to their tastes, it should include a customization stage at the end of installation process, which allows the users to change their color schemes, window decorations, KDM themes and widget styles.

* Personally, I think purple is a bit too polarizing for the default Kubuntu wallpaper.  I'm afraid that too many people will be initially turned off by it.  My suggestion is to use a more subdued default wallpaper that has wider appeal, but upon installation or the first time a user logs in, present a customization wizard that offers to let the user change things like the wallpaper, colors, widgets, etc. right away.  Have it show the user all of the included wallpapers on one screen, and then if they like purple or whatever, then they can choose it immediately.

* I see this art work as a positive step in the right direction, however I am still concerned about how the Ubuntu GUI works for the average user. When I installed Ubuntu, I had two panels (one at the top for no good reason, I felt) plus I had to look at the orange Ubuntu Breezy background. Honestly, the first thing I did was change the background. However, I am liking the look of Knot 2 so far, and see the default Kubuntu look as advancing in strides.

* Hi, I like the purple colour scheme for Edgy knot2. I think the it should be used with the Polyester Window decoration (and the Polyester set to Glass at the buttons). And yes, a Kubuntu sign would be nice on the wallpaper. 

* hey kenneth, great job. i esp. love the last kdm look... also the yellow flower is cool. and i'd love to see polyester as style, i really miss it. btw, domino is a cool style as well, as is qtcurve.... if you like the glassy look of polyester, that is.

* Very nice. Though looking at the Knot2 preview-page (<nowiki>[[EdgyEft/Knot2/Kubuntu]]</nowiki>)gave me a small shock. Somehow the purple theme blends well with the sunflower wallpaper but not with the purple one. It simply looks much too intense.

* I don't like the purple, it's good that it's different to official KDE colours but purple is not the way to go. Purple is a very difficult colour to get right. I would suggest that either a blue, grey or brown colour scheme would be better. and what's wrong with going with the ubuntu human colours? It's probably a good idea unifying Ubuntu and Kubuntu in look/colour scheme at least to some extent. Also I think the yellow and purple coloured wallpapers etc are horrible colours, yellow and purple don't mix very well. Please please PLEASE change this.

* Nice job, I like purple and I also think it is good if Kubuntu differentiate from offical KDE colors a bit.  -- LukaRenko     * What is the plan with the icons? Do we want to also give them a bit of purple touch or not? In that case <nowiki>[[http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=23499|this icon set]]</nowiki> might be interesting to look into.
*** I would also like to have a bit less abstract wallpaper and I think we should put at least "kubuntu" somewhere on wallpaper - this is very important for reviews when they publish screenshots.

* I'm only concerned about one thing: Why does the default wallpaper have Gold and Purple? I thought it was just going to be purple...looks a bit weird like that -Viper550
* I agree, it's messing up the whole theme... I don't think the wallpaper is attractive at all... I think a mixture of blue and purple, with the Kubuntu logo and name would be MUCH better (closer to the bottom, and to the right, not at the middle)... I prefer this wallpaper: http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=43829 it's simple and professional, and it's Kubuntu-ish :D + it'll look ok with a colour changed to a mixture of blue and purple :) - JohnnyLevai

* Great job, although I don't like purple at all. My questions are: Why don't put in Kubuntu Human colors??? Why don't improving QtCurve to set up a Human theme for KDE???
*** I agree, QtCurve is easily the best-looking and most-configurable Qt style there is.  It's also in active development, as opposed to being abandoned by its author.  Edgy should really consider using QtCurve as the default style.
*** It has that glassy and friendly look combined..., I vote for QtCurve, it's what we need :) - JohnnyLevai
*** I vote for the latest Polyester, I like QtCurve but Polyester has some great features, like that wonderful fading button effect! And its design is very slick.

* I think that a bit too purple i had too get back to blue, the kdm is wonderfull but kubuntu human colors would have been better. Anyway great job but please do something for that "too much purple on my  windows"  Another thing is the wallpaper you should put "kubuntu" logo somewhere and do it less purple ... again >>this would be more professionnal and 2006 stylish <nowiki>[[https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Artwork/Incoming/Blubuntu|blubuntu]]</nowiki>

* I'd like to congratulate kwwii on the fantastic job he's doing with Kubuntu artwork. Certainly what we're seeing now is much more refined than previous artwork, and I think the gui love was something that make people feel Ubuntu had primacy over Kubuntu.
******* The amarok context bar is especially well done. Not sure how it will look contasting to all my album art but off the bat is looks great.
******* The purple is really growing on me. Initially I was a bit reserved but it looks great on my Knot 2. Not sure if I'm just wowed by the extra polish. If kwwii poured all his energy into a blue version I'd probably prefer that. Brown kubuntu could be interesting but not sure what it would mean for the Kubuntu gear logo, if it were make the same colours as the ubuntu symbol it might confuse users by being too similar to distinguish.
******* windecs are great especially the "close window" X highlight.  I agree QT curve looks great and is very slick and professional. However it looked horrible when I used it with the purple theme. Looks great on my blue dapper box.
******* wallpaper looks great I find it really defines the desktop and looks better than the flower. (although it might be nice to include the yellow flower wallpaper too and remove some of the legacy wallpapers....urgh).
******* KDM  and wallpaper make Kubtuntu and Ubuntu artwork seem more unified even with different colour schemes. Not sure about the blue Kubuntu logo though.  
 Conclusion: Love the purple but maybe its a bit too daring. Maybe its best to really refine and polish Kubuntu-blue, with royal blue colours and QTcurve as standard. Create a slick professional look. Its what I've had so far and many people have commented to me they preferred it over Ubuntu's default human look. With Vista just around the corner looking very slick I'm worried this purple slightly nuvola style look is headed in the wrong direction. Amarok context bar could easily look great in blue. I always preferred the non-crystal Kubuntu logo too, from the Hoary days and on the Dapper ShipIt CDs. From what I saw of the Oxygen icons running on Kwwii's test pics of his Kubuntu desktop they would be better complemented by a serious blue look too. Either way I would really like to see the purple theme kept in as optional in edgy, just as it is......it looks really good.       --dissidentcitizen

* Found a great kicker theme, it looks very good, using it now: http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=43121&vote=good&tan=18645268 - JohnnyLevai

* I would like to see a modernised version of the BII (BeOS-Clone) Theme... It's really handy, requires less space and makes the need for a task-list irelevant in many cases... I guess it would give default-kubuntu (and all of those BII-Lovers out there) something new... ;-) --<nowiki>[[http://www.psiplus.at|PSIplus]]</nowiki>

* as for me i dont like new artwork in edgy as well as colorset. i think old one in dapper looks better ;)  also icon in guidance is also very contrast. it has too much light green. maybe use old icon from klaptopdeamon?

* after some weeks with the purple, i still dislike it,and it's more and more. lot's of people are disliking it, i wish kubuntu artwork team will hear our voices. get back to blue (or another color) or people will leave the purple boat. (look at fedora, mandriva, suse they have a very classy/professionnal look) not the purple of that edgy kubuntu. I know we can change the default theme to a color that fits more my preference, but think of the novice (ubuntu was created for this...) think to the impact on the community, think of the screenshot of OsDir people will laugh saying that this purple is really awfull. i think that the last artwork were great, not that one. i won't tell people to upgrade to edgy (this added to the point that there is no real advance : where is the edgy part promised by mark?) i know there is still a month before the release, but i had to say this.

* I still think blue is the best. Also, what about green? - kism
* After rethinking everything, I stick to blue, but if you want to change, port the Ubuntu human look, or the Blubuntu look, that is gentle, pro, and blue :) - JohnnyLevai
* I rather liked the progress of each action showing up on the USplash screen while booting. I vote to have that back. - DaveQB
 
* For the boot (USplash), I would also prefer to have the possibility to have more information about what is going on. Why not a key like ESC to switch between the mode (as in Mandriva for instance) --fnx
