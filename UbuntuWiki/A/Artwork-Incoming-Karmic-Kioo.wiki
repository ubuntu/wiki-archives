=== Kioo ===

Kioo is the Swahili word for glass. The ''glassy'' look of this theme is why I chose this word as the name of the theme.

=== Design ===

The Kioo theme is a balance between shades of grey, brown and orange resulting in a theme which is easy on the eyes in any lighting condition.

=== Installation ===

One method to install a Gnome theme is to open the "Appearance Preferences" dialogue under '''`System>Preferences`''' menu and click the <Install> button. Gnome will prompt you to select a theme which in this case is `Kioo-0.1.tar.gz`. Once installed, select the ''Kioo'' theme from the list of available themes.

=== Recommendations ===

The Human icon theme fits into the Kioo theme very well.
