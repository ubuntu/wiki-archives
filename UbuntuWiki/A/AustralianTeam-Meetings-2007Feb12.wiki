* Meeting day review: We need to check that Monday is still the best day
to meet on.

Ok, now this one counts for everyone who could possibly want to attend
Ubuntu-Au meetings. Please register your preferences with our meeting
day decide-o-matic at http://ubuntu.org.au/meeting-prefs/

Please register your preferences by the end of next week so the new
meeting day can be announced with appropriate warning.

If you fail to register your preferences, you cannot complain about the
meeting time :P

* Paul Schulz was interested in who else catches up with other
Ubuntuites, since he caught up with people in Perth recently.

People discussed when they had met other Ubuntu users.

* Paul Schulz announced the IT Discovery Day at the Mawson Lakes Center.

Sun, 25 Feb, 2pm-5pm - IT Discovery Day, Mawson Lakes. Ubuntu-Au has a
table and has received 300 CD's to give away at the event. (Some of
these have already been distributed as promotional material.) This
effort is being supported by Bettong, Air-Stream.Org and JoelStanly
(shenki) who has a OLPC laptop. The event is organised by Delfin-Lend
Lease to launch of their new community website, and is featuring
technology demonstrations by Telstra and Harvey-Norman. PaulSchulz

* Meeting frequency discussion (Unannounced, deferred to next meeting)

* ToDo List (Unannounced)

Members present decided that a good way to increase meeting
participation would be to create more ways for people to get involved.

We decided to create a ToDo list to which ideas could be posted for
people to take up. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AustralianTeam/WhiteBoard

* MatthewV resigned from Wiki duty

MatthewV had until recently, been the assigned wiki scribe with regard
to general management (front page, categorising) and meetings.
Unfortunately he no longer has time and has gracefully stepped down.

Thanks MatthewV. We appreciate the work you've done for us  :) 

Reassigning this task has been deferred to next meeting.

== Agenda ==

* Thoughts on Ubuntu at LCA and openday. (KarlGoetz)

* Meeting day review
** We need to check that Monday is still the best day to meet on.

* Ubuntu Meetups
** While in Perth recently, I was able to catch up with a couple of people in the team, put some names to faces and pass on some Edgy CD's. Does anyone else meet up (physically!) with fellow Ubuntu-ites? and what do they get up to? PaulSchulz (pschulz01)

* Upcoming events
** Sun, 25 Feb, 2pm-5pm - IT Discovery Day, Mawson Lakes. Ubuntu-Au has a table and has received 300 CD's to give away at the event. (Some of these have already been distributed as promotional material.) This effort is being supported by Bettong.org, Air-Stream and JoelStanly (shenki) who has a OLPC laptop. The event is organised by Delfin-Lend Lease to launch of their new community website, and is featuring technology demonstrations by Telstra and Harvey-Norman. PaulSchulz (pschulz01)

* Minutes / Logs
** Unfortunately, I can no longer guarantee being able to do the minutes and logs for the meetings. I can still do them when able, but as I'm usually unable to attend the meetings, overall it seems to make sense to allow someone else to do this, or find some other arrangement. I'll try to make it to the meeting, but no guarantee :( - MatthewVermeulen (MatthewV)
