Still not sure which page is the "correct" one and which page (if any?) needs to be deleted.  For full explanation, see the "On Duplicating Oneself, A Treatise On The Misunderstanding of the Epistemology of Personal Identity" located at <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AdamBButler|that *other* page]]</nowiki>.  Still learning here, folks -- thanks for the patience!
