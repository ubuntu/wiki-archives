Subject: Artful Aardvark Beta 1 Released!

The first beta of the Artful Aardvark (to become 17.10) has now been released!

This milestone features images for Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu
Kylin, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu Studio and Xubuntu.

Pre-releases of the Artful Aardvark are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a
stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even
frequent breakage. They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu flavor developers
and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs as we work
towards getting this release ready.

Beta 1 includes a number of software updates that are ready for wider testing.
This is still an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs.

While these Beta 1 images have been tested and work, except as noted in the
release notes, Ubuntu developers are continuing to improve the Artful Aardvark.
In particular, once newer daily images are available, system installation bugs
identified in the Beta 1 installer should be verified against the current daily
image before being reported in Launchpad. Using an obsolete image to re-report
bugs that have already been fixed wastes your time and the time of developers
who are busy trying to make 17.10 the best Ubuntu release yet. Always ensure
your system is up to date before reporting bugs.
