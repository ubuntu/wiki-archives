=== Comments ===

I like this a lot! However I would have the symbols inside the window control buttons less blurry, however more blurry on mouseover -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:rugby471]]</nowiki> 
I think this is a great idea, and I agree with the previous commenter who suggested being able to see the icons faintly before mousing over them. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dbowlin17]]</nowiki>
