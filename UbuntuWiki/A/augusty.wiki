I'm an IT Consultant based in Trinidad and Tobago. I focus on helping businesses become more efficient and productive, by providing end-to-end solutions, that are customized to their needs. My focus, at them moment is on IT security.

I'm relatively new to Ubuntu. Although I used it as a primary OS for some time. I will learn more about it, especially how it can help business become more efficient and productive. I would love to become a contributor to the Ubuntu project in the future.
