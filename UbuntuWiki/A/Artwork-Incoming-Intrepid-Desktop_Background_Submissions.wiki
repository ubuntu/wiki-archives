It's more organized to keep all the submissions for a desktop background in one place, rather than cluttering up the /Intrepid/ folder of the wiki, so please put all submissions for default desktop backgrounds here under your own heading.

=== Ibex on a Mountain ===

I'm very new here  -I don't even know if I'm editing this page correctly. Let me know what you think.

=== Ibex-> Earth Blue with a fresh determined look - Parthsarathi Trivedi ===

The blends of blue used in this wallpaper are derived from the same colour palette found on our planet. Additionally, 70% of the human body consists of water. Although water itself is transparent, the great bodies of water enhance the blues in the skies by echoing the colours through the H20. Plain and simple, this wallpaper defines the Ibex as an animal who is determined, fearless and invulnerable to intimidation. Just like the operating system. The horns of this animal are rendered in this image with bold highlights and shadows, against a fresh background designed by me, specially for this piece. The eye of this animal has been given special attention to detail and makes the Ibex come alive on your desktop. I give you a wallpaper as futuristic yet simple as the operating system itself.

I would be happy to answer any queries and suggestions at parthsarathitrivedi@gmail.com. Feel free to email me. A link to the full widescreen wallpaper is given below. I will be able to produce the wallpaper in a variety of resolutions if/when required.

=== Ibex in the Style of Hardy ===

Who did the hardy wallpaper? I think it would be neat to have that same person do the Ibex wallpaper.
Salane Ashcraft

I did not create the Hardy wallpaper but really like it as well. I think that wallpapers in the style of the hardy wallpaper create a very distinct look, while still showing consistency over several releases. I started working on a similar wallpaper for Intrepid. So far it is just a b/w svg-image which was traced from a picture. The <nowiki>[[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Capra_ibex_ibex_–_03.jpg|original picture]]</nowiki> from wikipedia commons by Nino Barbieri is published under GFDL as well as CC-BY. I actually don't know if that fulfills Ubuntus requirements as for a free license - can somebody let me know? I chose this picture because the horns are so nicely circular, reminding me of the circle of friends. I'm not sure if I should make the reference more clear in a final version of the picture.

<nowiki>[[File:BackgroundIbexAtrejuThumb.png]]</nowiki>

In the current state the svg (see below list of attachments) still needs a lot of work. I'm sort of happy with the outline but now it needs to be filled with color which I only just started doing (and all the stuff is stolen from FelaKuti, so credit the maker there...) Any comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated, as is anyone who wants to work on this with me.

=== Ibex front view ===

It is hard to repeat the artwork style of FelaKuti, so I figured I might get things started by making a line drawing of the frontal view of an ibex. Here is the result. I just could not find a frontal view online... so I looked at a few and used my imagination... apparently my imagination is not all that bad!

I do not know how to make a preview of the drawing guys... could someone please somehow do it for me?

=== Intrepid Ibex in the Sands ===

This is based on a hand drawn sketch I made. I scanned and played with GIMP to make the colours and background fit, but it's far from complete.

=== Abstraction ===

This is actually an edited photo taken with a very slow shutter speed. I also have a human version that looks more like Feisty...

* Who made this?  Hobbsee (info on launchpad) would like a copy of this at 1280x800 resolution.  Thanks!

=== Sunny Ibex ===

Made with Inkscape. It needs polishing, I'll keep updating it. I can't promise to do it very often though, I should been studying for my exams! :D

=== Open Source Photos ===

Truism of the day: photography can be beautiful.  People love looking at pictures.  That is why I suggest including a decent selection of 5 to 7 open source photographs in future release of Ubuntu, starting with Intrepid Ibex.  Not the default wallpaper, just some alternates.  I suggest the following images be included as alternates, based on the way they compliment Ubuntu's Brown/Black/Orange colors.  All were downloaded from the Wikimedia Commons (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), and *I beleive* can be used free of license issues.  The only way I edited these images was to convert them from JPEG to PNG.  I present them here in their original demensions, but I would be happy to resize them if the art team wants to use them and give me some busy work ;)  -Brian Fleeger

* Please, comment any idea you have to improve this wallpaper. -- IñigoAlonso  * The first one is creepy. The Hardy Heron rip-off is beautiful but needs more form to the Ibex. The third, fourth (and was there a fifth?) I don't like. They seem to plain or childish.-- Brettalton ----

=== Orange Feathers ===
This would probably have been a bit better for Hardy as it depicts the feathers of a bird's tail (a chicken!). I think this is great as it uses ubuntu's default colors, but is more interesting than a boring brown...

{{http://img397.imageshack.us/img397/1061/chickentl0.png}}

I hope you like it.
P.S. This is my first attempt at doing something like this, i'm just getting involved in this great community - so, sorry if it comes out wrong, etc!

=== Ibex, et cetera ===
I was looking to find out more on what an Ibex actually is, and stumbled across the Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibex).

I drew a correlation between the circular shape of the Ibex horn and the Circle of Friends logo.  This is the end result:

I realize it may be a faux pas to hide part of the CoF, and if so, I apologize.  Any suggestions or (constructive) criticisms are greatly welcome.  Although I have been an avid fan of Ubuntu since way back in the 4.10 days, this is my first foray into the Ubuntu community.  I hope it's well received!

* I like this one, it's great, BUT remove the Ibex, the Ubuntu logo and the upper yellow line of dots.
The guidelines sasy that it needs to be simple and if you brand them it should be with a small logo and tasteful. --Silfiriel

* I aggree, lose the logo & top line of dots and you have a winner my friend! -/- Rugby471

=== Ibex, drawing in curves and shapes ===
Not really a finished background. Inspired to give something a go by you guys. Thought it would be interesting to do an ibex not in profile but a more interesting view. I like the way that the angle gives the impression that the ibex is on the move. Please feel free to use and modify. I will probably combine this with a proper background at some point.

I have mixed feelings about this image after i created it. Part of me likes the idea of having animal wallpaper that matches the name of the release, and part of me doesent. Part of me likes mark shuttleworth's idea that we should make it look better than mac's, but animal wallpaper can only go so far... Maybe we can combine the two by only focusing on animal fur,feathers, and scales. Then again maybe not. who knows. -Andrew Barney

I really like it!  I changed it up a bit, and put it with the beautiful Dust theme, and GNOME's GION icon set. I'll attach a screenshot of it below.
