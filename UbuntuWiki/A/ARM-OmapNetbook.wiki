== Natty Narwhal (11.04) Installation Instructions ==

To use preinstalled OMAP3/4 Natty (11.04) images, apply the following steps:

=== Downloading ===

Download the compressed image from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/11.04/
* For omap3 platforms, use ubuntu-11.04-preinstalled-netbook-armel+omap.img.gz
* For omap4 based systems, use ubuntu-11.04-preinstalled-netbook-armel+omap4.img.gz

 /!\ Warning /!\ Check the md5sum to verify the image

=== Booting the image ===

On Pandaboard and BeagleXM (rev A) just switch on the board with the SD card inserted.

==== On older Beagleboards ====
Insert SD card with new image into the beagleboard and reset while holding User1 button on system

/!\ On omap3 systems with a modified NAND (i.e. beaglebord C series) do the following:  

On a serial console connected to the system, halt any autoboot script and type 
<pre>
setenv bootcmd 'mmc init;fatload mmc 0 0x82000000 boot.scr;source 0x82000000'; setenv autostart yes; saveenv; boot
</pre>
The system should start booting (note that this step is only necessary if you have a NAND and the system does not default to reading boot.scr)

=== Update for BeagleXM Rev B & Rev C ===

Natty does not support these boards with the released image.  The updated kernel & u-boot that were in a tarball is no longer available.  We recommend just using Oneiric (11.10) or Precise (12.04) for these platforms.
