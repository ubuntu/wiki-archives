No more security updates after that date, so if you are still using 7.04 you need to upgrade to 7.10. Remember that if you want to upgrade to 8.04, you must first upgrade to 7.10, you can not skip to the most recent version.

[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:06:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	The Server Team wants to know: Where does Ubuntu Server fit into your IT environment? Members of the Server team devised a set of questions to better understand where and why you are using Ubuntu Server to support your IT infrastructure. Completing the survey, http://survey.ubuntu.com/, takes around 20 minutes and topics such as hardware, virtualization and system integration are covered.

[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:11:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	we just did the annoucements and are going to talk about release/installfest parties for intrepid
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:11:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	OK, the release date for Intrepid has been set as Oct. 30th, 2008. That's a Thursday.
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:11:22] Part	snits has left this channel.
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:11:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	From what I've found out about bulk shipments for approved teams, there should be a early order date for delivery 2 wks after the release. That would make it the 15th as a target date for the installfest. As for a release party, we could still have one closer to the release date, but...
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:12:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	i need imput on whether we want to do both

[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:13:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	my thinking is that we do a installfest for the 15th'ish and if we want to do an impromptu release party we can fit that in

[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:21:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	we can concentrate on the campus angle, but we shouldn't overlook others that might be interested
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:21:27] <kennymc0>	sooner we have a set date, place and time we can start advertising
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:21:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:21:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	Also flyers, we can probably adapt one of our previous flyers to fit.
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:21:55] <snarkster>	YES we really need to advertise
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:22:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	.
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:22:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	Again, we want to include as many of the state user groups as possible to make it a coordinated event.
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:22:16] <snarkster>	I can place posters, flyers at my campus
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:22:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	cool
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:22:25] <tyche>	I'll take a look at the fliers I've got on file, and see if I can adapt one.

[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:22:50] <snarkster>	ok
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:22:55] 	 * BaD_CrC can only imagine the possibilities if Myspace played along with Ubuntu releases
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:22:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'll get with the two contacts at the two campuses this wk and try to firm up a date that's good for all
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:23:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	BaD_CrC: :)
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:23:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, something else we've missed out on i think are: Demos, gaming, etc ??
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:23:48] <BaD_CrC>	i think i still have a couple of contacts at Westwood HS in Mesa that might be able to help. i'll check and keep ya posted.
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:23:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's something we could advertise in the flyers
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:23:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	BaD_CrC: thx

[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:24:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'm thinking on a college campus if we ran a game server at the installfest it would draw more students
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:24:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	.
[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:25:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	does that make sense ??

[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:25:16] <tyche>	Yea, but it's not something I know how to do.

[Sun Sep 28 2008] [21:27:56] <word>	johnc4510-laptop: if you talk to the right people you could probably get a mass mailer advertising the event to all of the engineering students, or at least all of the SCI students (school of computing and informatics)
