21:04 < SloggerKhan> Interesting snreen name
21:05 < johnc4510> https://launchpad.net/~norahaura
21:05 < NorahAura> I have always been interested in FOSS, but wasn't completely satisfied with the Desktop solutions until this year.....
21:05 < NorahAura> johnc: ty :)
21:05 < johnc4510> np
21:06 < Polygon89> trust me you'll like that everything is free.
21:06 < NorahAura> I first became aware of Ubuntu a couple of years ago, tried the live cd, but wasn't too impressed
21:06 < NorahAura> tried it again early this year and was very pleased
21:06 < johnc4510> cool
21:06 < tyche> It's come a long way.
21:06 < johnc4510> we likey
21:06 < johnc4510> you using gnome or kde?
21:06 < johnc4510> or one of the others
21:07 < NorahAura> I built an ubuntu-only pc in April of this year, have upraded to Fiesty, then Gusty!
21:07 < johnc4510> nice
21:07 < NorahAura> gnome
21:07 < johnc4510> :)
21:07 < johnc4510> did you have any troubles updating from feisty?
21:07 < tyche> I saw you file bug reports.  Good for you!
21:07 < NorahAura> I have learned more about linux in the past few months than all the years before! :)
21:08 < johnc4510> excellent
21:08 < NorahAura> my upgrade to gusty from feisty was great!
21:08 < johnc4510> :)
21:08 < tyche> :-D
21:08 < NorahAura> of course, I followed the upgrade guide....
21:08 < johnc4510> ok, ty NorahAura and welcome to the team :-)
21:08 < tyche> Welcome, NorahAura
21:08 < NorahAura> and had to re-install nvidia drivers... used envy, no other way in my opinion :)
21:08 < NorahAura> thx!
21:09 < johnc4510> br24: you around?
21:09 < johnc4510> shows he is away
21:09 < johnc4510> so, we'll skip the ed. team report tonight but
21:10 < johnc4510> i know the tyche and jsonders have been feeding new info to him for the ed team page
21:10 < johnc4510> on the server side, it looks like i have recruited NorahAura and enigmastrat to work with slofgren on the server team
21:10 < johnc4510> now
21:11 < johnc4510> i'd like to see if people are interested in a gutsy install party
21:11 < johnc4510> so
21:11 < johnc4510> people interested please vote +1
21:11 < johnc4510> not interested -1
21:11 < johnc4510> :)
21:12 < enigmastrat> +1
21:12 < NorahAura> +1
21:12 < SloggerKhan>  +/- 0   : No computers for it.
21:12 < johnc4510> kk
21:12 < Polygon89> cant come....so sorry
21:12 < johnc4510> kk
21:12 < johnc4510> tyche: ?
21:12 < tyche> I don't see anyone else in my area.
21:12 < johnc4510> ah
21:12 < tyche> But I'll probably be reinstalling sometime soon.
21:12 < enigmastrat> yeah, my +1 would depend on time and place
21:12 < johnc4510> kk
21:12 < tyche> On at least ONE of the partitions.
21:13 < tyche> If there are others interested in my area, then I'd have to see.
21:13 < enigmastrat> I drove *through* fountain hills on monday :)
21:13 < johnc4510> ok, i'll mention it again in the team newsletter and see if we can draw some more interest
21:13 < tyche> Didn't take long, did it.
21:13 < johnc4510> enigmastrat: tyche stole my answer
21:13 < johnc4510> :)
21:13 < enigmastrat> it just took 1:15 for me to get there
21:14 < enigmastrat> maybe 45 minutes
21:14 < tyche> That's 1 minute, 15 seconds, and he was through.
21:14 < enigmastrat> yeah
21:14 < enigmastrat> I saw the Fry's Food and then there was just desert and a Casino
21:14 < tyche> Yep.
21:14 < enigmastrat> nothin till Payson
21:14 < tyche> You blinked.  You missed the golf course.
21:14 < johnc4510> kk, i think since we have some enigmastrat and NorahAura here we should talk about what we want on the main server page.
21:15 < enigmastrat> ok
21:15 < johnc4510> kk?
21:15 < NorahAura> I got even better: arizona city is about 2 ms breezeby
21:15 < tyche> Team logo
21:15 < johnc4510> and slogan
21:15 < johnc4510> now, links
21:15 < tyche> Yep.  And "table of contents" or index.
21:15 < johnc4510> team wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam
21:16 < johnc4510> ubuntu forum link: http://ubuntuforums.org/index.php
21:16 < enigmastrat> What would be the primary purpose of this front page?
21:17 < johnc4510> support and advertisement of the team
21:17 < tyche> To lead people into all the other areas.  Membership, education, etc.
21:17 < tyche> As well as links to the LUGS
21:17 < enigmastrat> ok, so basically the wiki page with more controll over everything
21:17 < tyche> That sounds right.
21:17 < enigmastrat> sounds good
21:17 < johnc4510> a pointer to our team and ubuntu   resources in other words
21:17 < NorahAura> yeah, like a launchpad/portal for our team
21:17 < johnc4510> right
21:18 < enigmastrat> links to the forum, wiki, team pages etc...
21:18 < enigmastrat> *member pages
21:18 < johnc4510> team forum page http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=209
21:18 < johnc4510> no, i think they can link to members pages from the team wiki page
21:19 < tyche> Newsletter page.  Hee hee
21:19 < johnc4510> team launchpad page https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-arizona/
21:19 < NorahAura> Membership list https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-arizona/+members
21:19 < tyche> Yep and yep
21:20 < johnc4510> team mailing list https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-az
21:20 < NorahAura> or even more fun link to the team list: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-arizona/+mugshots
21:20 < johnc4510> we need to break out in different sub sections the things that are ubuntu and the ones that are our team
21:21 < tyche> That's not hard.
21:21 < johnc4510> NorahAura: nice
21:21 < johnc4510> :)
21:21 < tyche> Run 2 lists on the main page.
21:21 < johnc4510> LOL
21:21 < johnc4510> maybe 3 to start, because we want to link to the LUG's in the state
21:21 < johnc4510> so
21:21 < johnc4510> team
21:21 < johnc4510> ubuntu
21:22 < johnc4510> lug's
21:22 < tyche> That's just 3 colums.  Straight HTML
21:22 < enigmastrat> or php magic
21:22 < johnc4510> once we get the headers going, we can add links as they occur to us
21:22 < tyche> That would be your department, enigmastrat
21:22 < enigmastrat> :)
21:22 < johnc4510> i'm sure there are a lot i'm missing
21:23 < tyche> Yea, but it's a start.
21:23 < NorahAura> enigmastrat: I would love to see some PHP stuff, if nothing more than my selfish desire to learn it :)
21:23 < johnc4510> since i'm just trying to get a general outline
21:23 < johnc4510> that's a part of the idea of the server, for the members to learn server technique
21:24 < johnc4510> we want to keep the front page kind of simple and easy to use
21:24 < NorahAura> as a general outline, yes, we should have our logo, slogan and those three lists to start, I think
21:25 < enigmastrat> speaking of server, I've got mine shared to the outside world: 68.106.228.70
21:25 < johnc4510> we can always create subpages 
21:25 < enigmastrat> no http yet, ssh 2200
21:25 < johnc4510> cool
21:25 < johnc4510> and 
21:25 < johnc4510> i haven't forgotten your offer
21:25 < johnc4510> we may still take advantage of that
21:25 < NorahAura> to make it cleaner, it would be nice to have javascripty dropdown from a main item for each list
21:26 < tyche> I'd just have to remember to turn javascript for the site.
21:26 < johnc4510> enigmastrat: you need to talk to slofgren about your offer though
21:26 < enigmastrat> ok
21:26 < enigmastrat> well, if nothing else, it's a playground
21:26 < johnc4510> he is the team lead on this project 
21:27 < NorahAura> how about enigmastrat's pc as a test server, and the team server as the 'production' server?
21:27 < johnc4510> do we need java?
21:27 < johnc4510> not to be a wet blankert
21:27 < johnc4510> blanket
21:27 < enigmastrat> why would we need Java?
21:27 < johnc4510> NorahAura brought it up
21:27 < enigmastrat> ok
21:27 < johnc4510> ^^
21:27 < NorahAura> sorry If I caused any confusion...
21:27 < enigmastrat> missed that
21:27 < enigmastrat> I do Java too
21:27 < johnc4510> NorahAura: np
21:27 < tyche> Nope, javascript is different than java.
21:27 < johnc4510> these are team descission
21:28 < johnc4510> tyche: in what way
21:28 < enigmastrat> Java is a great thing to have on the system
21:28 < tyche> Most  browsers are javascript enabled.  Java is a separate VM
21:28 < johnc4510> kk
21:28 < Polygon89> java is slooowwww
21:28 < Polygon89> dont like it much
21:28 < johnc4510> showing my dumbness
21:28 < tyche> And, in many ways, javascript has been abused and overused.
21:28 < tyche> That's not dumb.
21:28 < johnc4510> is javascript open source?
21:28 < tyche> Most people don't know the difference.
21:29 < enigmastrat> no
21:29 < johnc4510> ah
21:29 < NorahAura> I only know html, really... so I am not sure how nifty 'web 2.0' dropdowns are done....
21:29 < Polygon89> yeah it is
21:29 < Polygon89> javascript is like an open standard
21:29 < johnc4510> kk
21:29 < enigmastrat> well, depending on how you define open source
21:29 < Polygon89> there was big news a while ago
21:29 < tyche> Javascript is a language added into HTML
21:29 < Polygon89> when adobe gave mozilla the code to the 
21:29 < enigmastrat> open standard is a good way to put it
21:29 < Polygon89> flash players like actionscript source
21:29 < Polygon89> which is essentially javascript
21:29 < johnc4510> well, i'm personally in favor of keeping the server open source as much as possible
21:30 < Polygon89> its a standard...
21:30 < enigmastrat> yes
21:30 < johnc4510> kk
21:30 < Polygon89> so it really cant be open source
21:30 < Polygon89> there are engines that parse javascript that are open source so yeah..
21:30 < johnc4510> ok, here's a ?
21:30 < johnc4510> should we use a css or wordpress template or create a new one?
21:31 < NorahAura> just for my clarification, do you know what language/platform/etc that 'dropdowns' are created in?  ie: ubuntu.com, hover over support, shows four options
21:31 < johnc4510> i don't
21:31 < enigmastrat> lemme check
21:31 < Polygon89> that is just plain javascript
21:32 < Polygon89> either that or html
21:32 < enigmastrat> I'm not seeing it, but unless unless you see a flash doc, it'll be javascript
21:32 < NorahAura> thx, I was hoping I was on the right track :)
21:32 < tyche> http://ubuntuforums.org/index.php, upper right hand corner.
21:32 < johnc4510> looking
21:32 < tyche> Hover over the words, and you'll see the dropdowns.
21:32 < enigmastrat> see it now, thx
21:33 < tyche> They're javascript.  I've got the source up.
21:33 < johnc4510> yep
21:33 < johnc4510> and a css template
21:33 < johnc4510> it looks like
21:33 < enigmastrat> yup
21:33 < tyche> Yep.
21:34 < tyche> link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="clientscript/vbulletin_css/style-dcc708dc-00074.css"
21:34 < johnc4510> i would like the page, whether template or something we create to be different than the ubuntu template
21:35 < johnc4510> i think
21:35 < johnc4510> it should reflect AZ
21:35 < enigmastrat> do we have other CSS, javascript, php/java, html coders in the group?
21:35 < johnc4510> we do not
21:35 < johnc4510> :)
21:35 < enigmastrat> ok
21:35 < enigmastrat> I mean any, not all of those
21:35 < johnc4510> that's why i was so happy to get you?
21:35 < johnc4510> LOL
21:36 < NorahAura> I have done some CSS, mostly html, little bit of javascript
21:36 < johnc4510> k back to the template
21:36 < johnc4510> cool
21:36 < enigmastrat> well, I guess I'm glad I'm wanted
21:36 < johnc4510> ty NorahAura 
21:36 < enigmastrat> ok
21:36 < NorahAura> www.NorahAura.net for example (did a couple years ago)
21:36 < Polygon89> css is easy
21:36 < johnc4510> looking
21:36 < johnc4510> oh, NorahAura that's nice
21:36 < johnc4510> :)
21:36 < johnc4510> creative
21:36 < tyche> WOW!!!!
21:37 < tyche> Sign her up, johnc4510.  Don't let her get away.  Hee hee
21:37 < johnc4510> i already did
21:37 < johnc4510> LOL
21:37 < johnc4510> ok
21:37 < johnc4510> so
21:37 < johnc4510> i would like the team page to have some kind of theme or picture representative of the state
21:38 < johnc4510> grand canyon
21:38 < johnc4510> sadona
21:38 < johnc4510> or whatever
21:38 < tyche> sadona -> Sedona
21:38 < johnc4510> what do you folks think?
21:38 < johnc4510> yep
21:38 < tyche> Definitely.
21:38 < enigmastrat> I think that's perfectly doable
21:38 < johnc4510> maybe just a picture in the header
21:38 < johnc4510> not sure
21:38 < NorahAura> yes, definitely an AZ theme
21:39 < johnc4510> kk
21:39 < johnc4510> what ideas, do you folks have
21:39 < johnc4510> pleae
21:39 < johnc4510> please
21:39 < johnc4510> we are open here
21:39 < johnc4510> and it's a team project
21:39 < johnc4510> SloggerKhan: you have any ideas
21:39 < tyche> I haven't been too many places,  but I do have some photos of RedRocks that can be used, if you like.
21:39 < enigmastrat> well, with my design posted I would like to change that side vine to a cactus like plant
21:40 < johnc4510> kk
21:40 < johnc4510> cool
21:40 < johnc4510> a good idea
21:40 < enigmastrat> I think that will help our theme
21:40 < tyche> there's plenty of them in AZ to choose from.  LOL
21:40 < enigmastrat> I believe it was tyche's
21:40 < enigmastrat> wait.. no slogger's?
21:40 < tyche> I think SloggerKhan's
21:40 < enigmastrat> anyway, not mine :)
21:40 < johnc4510> i also have some pics of the canyon and sadona that i have downloaded
21:41 < enigmastrat> but good
21:42 < NorahAura> I like tyche's RedRocks idea
21:42 < johnc4510> kk
21:42 < johnc4510> i'm looking at enigmastrat example again
21:43 < johnc4510> so
21:43 < johnc4510> maybe at the top where you have the arizona team, put the logo and slogan
21:43 < enigmastrat> ok
21:43 < NorahAura> enigmastrat's example w/ slogger's comments http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=47724&d=1193290395
21:43 < johnc4510> loss the vine and the ubuntu logo on the right
21:44 < SloggerKhan> hey, if you have your own ideas, go for it.
21:44 < johnc4510> i agree about losing the tux
21:45 < johnc4510> and the logo at the bottom
21:45 < johnc4510> it's old
21:45 < enigmastrat> yeah, the logo at the bottom is wrong anyway
21:45 < NorahAura> I agree about the official logo/slogan at the top
21:45 < johnc4510> here's another question
21:46 < johnc4510> should we and could we license the ideas once it's set up under creative commons license?
21:46 < NorahAura> I like the lighter background behind the text
21:46 < johnc4510> yep
21:46 < tyche> I see no reason why not.  Especially if its set to be non-commercial only.
21:46 < NorahAura> I don't know much about the creative commons license, what is it good for?
21:46 < tyche> It's a copyright license
21:47 < johnc4510> well, it protect your content
21:47 < johnc4510> but 
21:47 < johnc4510> is this content 
21:47 < johnc4510> or a web page
21:47 < johnc4510> ?
21:47 < tyche> Basically it's the GPL of content formats
21:47 < SloggerKhan> there are multiple cc licenses.
21:47 < johnc4510> kk
21:47 < johnc4510> i know that some folks license their blog material
21:47 < johnc4510> but
21:47 < tyche> See:  http://creativecommons.org/
21:48 < johnc4510> that is something written
21:48 < johnc4510> creative
21:48 < SloggerKhan> Generally you choose one that allows the level of freedom you want others to have when using your content
21:48 < johnc4510> ah
21:48 < johnc4510> kk
21:48 < tyche> Thanks, SloggerKhan.  I was having trouble defining it.  Hee hee
21:48 < johnc4510> maybe we don't need that, but i thought it worth bringing up
21:49 < Polygon89> it would be used for screencasts/tutorials if anything.
21:49 < NorahAura> why don't we table that for down the road once we have the concept realized
21:49 < tyche> It's good to copyright the work.  That way it can't be used in ways you don't want used.
21:49 < johnc4510> kk
21:49 < tyche> I agree with NorahAura
21:49 < johnc4510> agreed
21:49 < johnc4510> :)
21:49 < johnc4510> tabled
21:49 < johnc4510> any other ideas
21:49 < johnc4510> ?
21:50 < johnc4510> about general look and feel of the page
21:50 < enigmastrat> I'd like to finish up my design with suggestions tossed in and get them posted this week
21:50 < johnc4510> kk
21:50 < enigmastrat> I'll get it into the forums, and I'll hop in here to keep people posted
21:51 < johnc4510> such as, if we lose everything on the right, what do we put in there?
21:51 < tyche> That sounds great.
21:51 < johnc4510> or do we leave it blank?
21:51 < johnc4510> where the vine was
21:51 < tyche> On the right is a good place for links.
21:51 < NorahAura> I think it would be good to put the pic of sedona/redrocks/cactus, etc.... on the right
21:51 < johnc4510> oh, right
21:51 < enigmastrat> That scares me design wise
21:51 < tyche> That, too, could be done.
21:51 < johnc4510> :)
21:51 < johnc4510> enigmastrat: the pic or links?
21:52 < enigmastrat> pic
21:52 < tyche> Why?  Just layer it in Gimp, then flatten the layers.
21:52 < enigmastrat> nah, not code wise
21:52 < enigmastrat> just design
21:52 < johnc4510> ah
21:52 < enigmastrat> that's not to say the picture does not have a place in the page
21:52 < johnc4510> well, you and NorahAura are the ones with the experience
21:52 < enigmastrat> I'll play with it
21:53 < johnc4510> we have to rely on you two
21:53 < tyche> Let me know what you need, enigmastrat, and I'll help with  the graphic.
21:53 < johnc4510> cool
21:53 < enigmastrat> ok
21:53 < johnc4510> ok, i have one more thought
21:54 < johnc4510> the fuzzy lines across the top and bottom
21:54 < johnc4510> could we make those solid
21:54 < johnc4510> i like
21:54 < johnc4510> the fuzzy around the color edge
21:54 < johnc4510> but not the dividing lines
21:54 < enigmastrat> leave the inside a little more clean cut?
21:54 < johnc4510> yep
21:55 < enigmastrat> that would look nice
21:55 < johnc4510> what do you folks think
21:55 < tyche> That's a thought.  Makes it easier to move, too.
21:55 < johnc4510> NorahAura: ?
21:55 < NorahAura> I like all that I hear, I would like to hear what others think :)
21:56 < johnc4510> SloggerKhan: you have any thoughts
21:56 < enigmastrat> with the magic of PNGs moving will not be an issue
