== RedGlass ==

A concept of making everything glassy, each menu. With the power of modern computers and the power of Linux to draw the maximum out of them, this looks like a bright future. Might be considered as a competitor to other glass themes for other OSs.

=== Concept ===

Terminals, window backgrounds, everything would be a RedGlass with heavy Gaussian Blur. Any selected item would be a yellow glow. Every single action, even the appearance of the Yellow glow for selected items will appear with a smooth fade effect when hovered/clicked.
