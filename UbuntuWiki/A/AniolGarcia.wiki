== Brief Description ==

I'm a Mathematics and Computer Science student, and I'm a supporter, user and contributor of free (as in speech) software and hardware. I began using GNU/Linux at school, with Linkat 2.0 and quickly became interested in technology. When I got my first computer in 2011, I decided to install a GNU/Linux distro, and Ubuntu was my choice. I have been using it since then and in 2015 I got involved in the Catalan LoCo Team, helping them with everything I could in Release Parties, UbuntuGlobalJam and translations. In 2016 I became a member of the Organisation of the CatalanTeam.
