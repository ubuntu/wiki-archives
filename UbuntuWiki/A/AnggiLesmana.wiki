I am 24 years old. I work at an engineering company in jakarta, and I as an IT administrator. Every day I use linux for IT needs, there are enough I use Linux on servers for the needs of the firewall, internet, email, Jabber and others. I am very interested in linux, especially to ubuntu. I will continue using it forever.
