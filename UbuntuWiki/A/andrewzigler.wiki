== About ==
Hello!

I am a college student at the University of Texas at Austin. While I may not be a computer science major, I know my way around a computer and I like integrating my liberal arts education into the technology that I interface with daily.

I am looking to learn Python and work on projects related to Ubuntu. I also want to work with bugs and documentation writing. I'm still looking to get my feet wet, so if you have any new projects that you want help with, let me know!
