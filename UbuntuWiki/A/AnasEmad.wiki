His communication skills is more than perfect. We depend on these skills in every event we hold also his marketing knowledge is great. He helps greatly in our marketing plans. I can't find a way to thank him for his great help in the Egyptian open source community, actually he is one of those who are shaping our community.

* Anas is the dynamo of our LoCo. Without his enthusiasm, reliability, and communication skills the LoCo would not have been to where it is Today. Anas was instrumental in allowing us to network with the rest of Egypt's FOSS and IT communities.

Anas, thanks for all you have done for Ubuntu-EG, and please keep up the good work.

* I have been a member in many organizations in school & college, and i have never seen a public relations representative like Anas ! It has always been a problem in Linux communities, dealing with the public & successfully making campaigns, reaching out to students, non-geeks, new users, everyone, and that's what makes Anas special person, whichever organization that has him in its public relations team is going to succeed in reaching out for many new audience of different cultures & interests. I personally would like to thank him for his efforts, and i wish him best of luck in getting Ubuntu membership & his life.

Almost no project I know related to Ubuntu or Open source but I found that Anas part of it or somehow contributed in it! He had contributed -and still- in a lot of wonderful community activities, Anas is DEFINITELY one of the most active people who I know!
