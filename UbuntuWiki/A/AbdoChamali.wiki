__TOC__

I am not sure where this should go in terms of posible develpment, for the next release of ubuntu i would love to see this feauter implemented.

the way it works is like this, the user would use the normal functions of right click to get access to the say file properties and so on, however, when they hold down the CTRL and right mouse click over a folder then a new menu item is shown. that gives them the option to add Emblems or give the folder/File a background colour,

before anyone deletes this please advise as to where i should place it or do with it. cheers

Hi, this suggestion needs to be made to the nautilus developers, either through an email to the <nowiki>[[http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/nautilus-list|nautilus mailing list]]</nowiki> or by filing a bug in <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.gnome.org]]</nowiki>. When you've seen this comment, you can delete this page :) -- <nowiki>[[mdke]]</nowiki>
