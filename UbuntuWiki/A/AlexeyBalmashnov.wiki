__TOC__

Hi, I am Alexey Balmashnov (aka Kwah), originally from Russia. I can characterize myself as a computer geek. 

Currently, I am being involved in various activities around Ubuntu and Russian Ubuntu Community. Mostly, these activities are translations and help to Russian speaking community. Taking it to more ''official'', level I am:
* active member and Team Contact of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-ru|Russian Team]]</nowiki> 
* active member of UbuntuRussianTranslators team
* moderator of the <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu.ru|Russian Community Forum]]</nowiki>

I think, that I am able to do at least something to spread and adopt FOSS, and I hope to see <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1|BUG #1]]</nowiki> fixed.
