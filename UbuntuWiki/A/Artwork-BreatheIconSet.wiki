== About ==
Ubuntu's icon theme could benefit from a refresh. Oxygen is a good, comprehensive and modern icon set. It doesn't have overly heavy outlines like Tango, but for our needs, it lacks the "Human-touch". So we will use it as a starting point.

We start with a base Oxygen set and replace the icons as suitable ones are created. The idea is to create as modern a set as Oxygen but with that distinctly Human feel. The set will also conform the the <nowiki>[[http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html#guidelines|FreeDesktop Naming Spec]]</nowiki>.
