=== Installation ===

One method to install a Gnome theme is to open the "Appearance Preferences" dialogue under '''`System>Preferences`''' menu and click the <Install> button. Gnome will prompt you to select a theme which in this case is `Pepper-0.1.tar.gz`. Once installed, select the ''Pepper'' theme from the list of available themes.

The Mist icon theme fits into the Pepper theme very well.
