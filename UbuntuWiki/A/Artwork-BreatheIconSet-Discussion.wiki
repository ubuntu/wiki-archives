== Folder Discussion ==

Below we have the two folder icons to work from. Please list below it good elements & bad elements from each so that we can go forward to create a better breathe folder icon.

=== Design Points to hit ===
* Color must be orange
* Use of the dots on the inside is strongly suggested
* Bottom glow (a totally artistic decision separate from reality) on the front of the folder.

=== Human ===

'''Good:'''

* Orange!! - Matches the human feel, however it needs to be a bit less saturated for a less cartoony look

* I think the question is which shade of any colour, think of the all the Pantone colours.

* 

'''Bad:'''

* Glossy when it doesn't need to be

* Do we need those dots when it is one of the most commonly used icons? Is that extra detail that we need?

* 

=== Oxygen ===

'''Good:'''

* The design shows it is 3D

* 

* 

'''Bad:'''

* Blue - Not human-like

* 

*
