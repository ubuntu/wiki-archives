=== Speakup overview ===

Speakup is a program that reads the text console, and sends what it 
reads to a speech synthesizer. It is in fact a kernel patch that is 
applied against any 2.4 or 2.6 kernel, and can be either a module, or 
compiled into the kernel. When it is in the kernel, it starts reading as 
soon as it loads, which is very early in the kernel load process.

For this reason, the speech synthesizer drivers are also kernel code, 
and can also be loaded as modules, or compiled directly into the kernel. 
When they are in the kernel, Speakup is able to read all the kernel boot 
messages as they are displayed, allowing the user to troubleshoot any 
problems.

Speakup offers a good default set of keys that can be used for screen 
review functions. The number pad, with numlock turned off is used for 
this task, allowing the user to read by line, word, and character. 
Colours, as well as current cursor position information can also be 
obtained with a press of a key. It is also possible to copy and paste 
text with Speakup. A default set of key commands is also provided for 
laptop users, with a modifier key, in this case the capslock key. The 
key commands are also fully customizable.

Speakup provides access to all virtual terminals, and keeps track of 
cursor position for each terminal. The copy and paste feature mentioned 
above can be used between terminals.

=== Issues ===

The fact that Speakup is kernel code presents one problem, the 
synthesizer drivers, which are also kernel code. Some of the speech 
synthesizers supported by these drivers are not supported by any other 
speech back-end under Linux. In order for these devices to 
be used for other software such as GNOME, these drivers will have 
to be ported to a userspace backend, that also needs to be 
decided. Read the Userspace Backend document for more information.

Speakup does have a way of allowing the user to send data directly to 
the speech synthesizer, which could mean the use of the kernel drivers for all 
devices with all software. However, the direct sending of text to the 
synthesizer doesn't support synthesizer commands, which would make it 
difficult to adjust speech rate, punctuation, etc.

The one notable exception to this is the software synthesizer driver. 
This driver allows speakup to be used with software speech synthesizers 
that are either in the kernel, or in userspace. Work on a kernel 
software speech synthesizer was started, but development has currently 
stalled, very likely indefinitely. However this would also allow Speakup 
to be used with any chosen backend that supported both hardware and 
software speech.

=== Conclusion ===

Speakup is by far the best console screen reader available, and would be 
a very good choice for an accessible Ubuntu installation, allowing 
access to the console. The kernel drivers for speech synthesizers would 
have to be ported as mentioned above, however they would still be useful 
in allowing users to receive speech feedback during the kernel boot 
process. The software synthesizer driver could then be used to allow 
speakup to work with any other speech synthesizer that is supported by a 
userspace backend.
