Blubuntu theme subpage for GTK Themes

== Submissions for the Blubuntu GTK Theme ==

=== Bluman, by Who ===
I have updated Bluman and called it Blubuntu. The theme file is here: <nowiki>[[attachment:blubuntu.tar.bz2]]</nowiki> and here is a screenshot for you all:

I would like to know whether you find the background too bright and the blue to light - I hope not, but I have an old CRT so I don't know what TFT people will feel :)

The old version can be seen <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome-look.org/content/pre1/39792-1.png|here]]</nowiki>

Bluman-Murrine.tar.gz

I modified it so that everything used the Murrine engine except for the scrollbar and progress bar

I like the Ubuntulooks Quicksilver theme created by madman2k, this theme is nice and conserve an original trait of the Human theme.

I really like the Blubuntu theme; I also made another theme using progress bars from the Aurora GTK engine and with non-glossy menubar items: http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Blubuntu-Aurora?content=62176
