__TOC__

Ayatana is a collective effort to improve the user experience of software in and for Ubuntu. It encompasses a number projects started by Canonical and is open for feedback, ideas and initiatives from the community. Activities reach from problem definition, research and conception to implementation.

The focus of the project is to improve the perception and presentation of information in the desktop, hence the name; the Buddhist term for a ''sense base'' or ''sense sphere''. Specific areas of interest that take priority over everything else are: notifications, indicators, window management, launcher, places, settings and menus.
