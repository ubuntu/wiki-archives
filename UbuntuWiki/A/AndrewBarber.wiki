=== About ===

My name is Andrew Alexander Barber, a young contributor from Scotland. I am currently studying Software Development at the <nowiki>[[http://www.centralcollege.ac.uk/|Central College of Glasgow]]</nowiki>. I am an active Scout leader in the non-geek world, devoting a few hours per night on different Scout groups.

=== Usage ===

I use ubuntu on my server and also my iBook G4. 
The Apple iBook G4 is my daily machine as I don't spend large amount of times at home, meaning I need something portable. The book dual boots with Mac OSX.
I have Ubuntu installed on home x86 machines however I never get to use these.

I started using Ubuntu very early on, however it never stuck untill fairly recently.

=== Translations ===

I am a member of the Ubuntu translation team, helping out primarily with the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/dapper/+lang/sco|Scots]]</nowiki> translation. I am slowly learning <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/dapper/+lang/gd|Scottish Gaelic]]</nowiki> too, so may soon be able to contribute with that group also. 

=== Support ===

==== IRC ====

I often use Internet Relay Chat to communicate with many members of the GNU/Linux and F(l)OSS community. I am an active helper in the #ubuntu channel, as well as many other channels stretching across the network. Other semi-large channels include #tuxhacker and #tapthru. <nowiki>[[http://tuxhacker.org|TuxHacker]]</nowiki> is a community set up by myself and others to help GNU/Linux users in a friendly way. A lot of the other channels that I am part of, are channels that I have chan-op status and help maintain their community.
I now moderate the official freenode channels; #freenode and #defocus

==== Fora/Forum Work ====

I currently only tend to use one fora, which is one that I also help moderate. The fora is called <nowiki>[[http://nuxified.org|Nuxified]]</nowiki>, and is aimed at providing help to Free/Open source software. It is part of the <nowiki>[[http://libervis.net|Libervis Network]]</nowiki> and has thus made me more active in the network as a whole. I used to help out on <nowiki>[[http://linuxforums.org|LinuxForums]]</nowiki> but left due to my stance on many activities of the fora.
Slowly but surely I am using more and more of ubuntu forums.

==== Launchpad ====

I often check on the answers section of the <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net|Lauchpad site]]</nowiki>.

=== Documentation ===

I have started working on community documentation for the Ubuntu Documentation team. Submitting articles on things I have worked on in the past and learning new things to document to help other members of the Ubuntu Community.

=== Testing ===

I have helped out with the laptop testing team, producing the following two articles;
* <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-FujitsuAmiloL7300]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-Apple_Macintosh-iBookG4]]</nowiki>

=== Promotion ===

I have handed out many, many live and install disks during my years as a GNU/Linux enthusiast. Even when not an Ubuntu user in my past, I would still pass out the Ubuntu distro as I thought it was best for new users. I also have asked local computer shops to keep a pile and hand out if possible. 
Along with that, I semi-regularly email my member of parliament (currently John McFall) about my views on F(l)OSS and Open Source matters. Including GNU/Linux usage in Schools, and within the local Council.
I hope to help out, and promote Ubuntu Linux (if the chance a rises) at any GNU/Linux event I attend this year.

=== Events ===

This year I should be attending;
* <nowiki>[[https://debconf7.debconf.org|DebConf]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://akademy.kde.org/|aKademy07]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.lugradio.org/live/2007/index.php/Main_Page|Lug Radio Live]]</nowiki>

=== LoCo ===

I am fairly active on the <nowiki>[[UKTeam]]</nowiki> mailing list, as well as the IRC channel. Much of the chat is genreal discussion but I help out with any problems too.
Also designing the new look loco pages, still in progress though.
 
=== Membership ===

I officially became an Ubuntu Member on April 3rd 2007.
