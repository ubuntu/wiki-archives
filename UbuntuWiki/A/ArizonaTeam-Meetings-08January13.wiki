[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:36:05] <ianmcorvidae>	that does seem reasonable
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:36:10] <tyche>	I'd need more information than I have now.  I'll talk to you about it.
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:36:14] <ianmcorvidae>	mid-june is kinda bad for arizona, though :P
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:36:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so we will set tentative dates
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:36:29] <ianmcorvidae>	I suppose we'll be inside, but nonetheless

[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:37:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so that leaves meetups
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:37:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	for the local ones, we can leave that up to tucson and phoenix to put together as seems fitting
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:38:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:38:08] <ianmcorvidae>	hopefully
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:38:19] <tyche>	We can work on something, I'm sure.
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:38:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	and if we do the barcamp, we can incorporate a statewide meeting into that
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:38:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:38:44] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:38:49] <ianmcorvidae>	it will probably end up as one anyway
[Sun Jan 13 2008] [21:38:59] <ianmcorvidae>	if any reasonable number of us participate :)
