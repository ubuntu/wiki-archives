== Edgy Inspired Button Concept ==

I decided to fire up Illustrator and see if I couldn't do better.

=== Concept ===

I'm a Windows user with no plans on moving to desktop Linux any time soon, but I'm fascinated by its progress and wish it the absolute best. Browsing some site (OSNews or digg or something), I came across a screenshot of some new Ubuntu login screen. I was struck by how poorly done the buttons were, so I decided to fire up Illustrator and see if I couldn't do better.

* Looks a little bit windows-ish but good. -- DrSilly

* I think that I like the original somewhat better. But it's great that you're helping out. Keep up the good work. -- AsjdfwejqrfjcvmMsz34rq33

* Imho it's a nice improvement, and I wish the new Ubuntu wouldn't introduce a whole different theme - the current one rocks. It's original and smooth, from what I've seen from the new one is that it's just ugly. Is it so hard to create something really good looking AND original, like Oxygen?

* Thanks for submitting your idea. FYI: The shiny outlined buttons idea is somewhat implemented by the (customizable) GTK/QT cross compatible theme "QTCurve". -- Zeroangel
