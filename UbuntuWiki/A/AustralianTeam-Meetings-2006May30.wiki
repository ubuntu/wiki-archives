* Ubuntu-in-schools / Distribution of Dapper
** There was a recent request for software from a (remotely located) School in South Australia. The SA Department of Education and Children Services is being contacted to see of there may be a more appropriate/efficient method of getting Ubuntu into the hand of people that want it, in particular for the distribution of Dapper. -- PaulSchulz (pschulz01)
