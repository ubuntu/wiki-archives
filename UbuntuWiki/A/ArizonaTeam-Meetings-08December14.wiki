[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:05:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	.
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:05:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	br24_: evening
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:05:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	.
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:05:34] <br24_>	hello
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:05:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, i have some news from the U of A
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	this is from Shawn Nock who was at the ABLEconf
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	.
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:21] Nick	br24_ is now known as br25.
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	From Shawn Nock at U of A
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	1. I can make this happen
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	2. There are several choices for rooms
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	3. There is a computer lab (quite large, lots of power available) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Building (30-40 people). This room is not under my direct control, we'd have to be very careful to leave it as we found it (or I'd never hear the end of it!). The lab is also open for general use at this time (no classes, but students in the department can use the lab).
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	4. There are also a couple of conference rooms that are 'mine' that would be more convenient to book, but would only provide power / room for around 15 people.
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	5. Let me know what you would prefer
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:06:44] Quit	br25 has left this server (Client Quit).
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:07:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	so
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:07:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	i can't tell if the conference rooms have internet access
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:07:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	to me
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:07:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	it doesn't look that way
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:07:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:07:43] <kennymc0>	well i dont know about you tucson people but us phoenix people clean up after ourselves rather well :)
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:07:59] <tyche>	What kind of equipment would we have to be careful of in the computer lab?
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:08:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	yeah, i don't see that as a problem
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:08:04] <johnc4510-laptop>	except
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:08:07] <tyche>	Computer lab implies computers.
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:08:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	if we happened to get some high strung students
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:08:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:08:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: agreed
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:08:41] <tyche>	Is there any other kind?
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:08:57] <kennymc0>	a science lab doesnt have computers usually
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:09:06] <kennymc0>	but a computer lab normally has computers
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:09:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:09:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	so
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:09:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	we need the internet access for sure
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:09:49] <kennymc0>	yeah so that we can run updates to fix any problems that might come up
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:09:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	so, should i reply and ask if the conference rooms have access?
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:09:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	and if so
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:09:59] <kennymc0>	and so we can chat between locations :)
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:10:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	and they are next to each other
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:10:23] <kennymc0>	yeah if you can get 2 or so next to eachother that would probably be best
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:10:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	we could use one or both and expand if necessary
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:10:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	or
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:10:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	we try to use the lab and hope nothing happens
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:10:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	if
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:10:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	the conference rooms don't have access
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:10:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	we should try the lab
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:00] <kennymc0>	could even set one up as first time installs and then have the other one for demonstrations and other fun stuff with ubuntu :)
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	kennymc0: good idea
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:14] <tyche>	That sounds good
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:30] <kennymc0>	but that all depends of if the conference rooms have internet access
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	i can't imagine a conference room that doesn't have internet access at a college
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:46] <tyche>	Check on the availability of internet in the conference rooms.  It all hinges on that.
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:46] <kennymc0>	you never know
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:49] <kennymc0>	it is in tucson
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:50] <kennymc0>	:P
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:11:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	the campus is wired for wireless i think
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:12:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:12:10] <kennymc0>	that doesnt help much for desktop installs though
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:12:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	he said the times didn't matter
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:12:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	kennymc0: right
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:12:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	i asked for 2-5 or 6 PM
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:12:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	on the 24th of Jan
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:12:52] <tyche>	Sounds good
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:13:16] <kennymc0>	i would have to leave around 4ish
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:13:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	now, i had discussed having some demos with azteech
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:13:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	kennymc0: np

[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:13:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:14:04] <johnc4510-laptop>	hmmm, maybe not
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:14:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, tyche or kennymc0 can you help me watch for azteech during the week ?
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:14:27] <kennymc0>	sure

[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:16:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: i think it might be best to wait until after the holiday for that??
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:16:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	slofgren: hurray
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:16:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:16:24] <tyche>	Depends on how you send them.
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:16:26] <kennymc0>	after xmas probably would be fastest

[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:17:10] <kennymc0>	yeah that probably wouldnt matter when you sent it

[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:18:31] <kennymc0>	it's ok as long as we get a place there's no problem
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:19:02] <tyche>	If all else fails, johnc4510-laptop can hold it in his house.  Hee hee
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:19:09] <kennymc0>	unless you're secretly trying to sabotage us so that tucson has the install fest this time and not phoenix
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:19:19] <kennymc0>	:P
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:19:25] <kennymc0>	lol
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:19:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	we can finish up the flyers as soon as i get zach's answer and tie down the u of a problem with rooms
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:19:40] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:19:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: that would be ok, you can watch mom and give me a break
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:19:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:20:04] <tyche>	She'd want to disown you.  Hee hee
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:20:07] <kennymc0>	well if we were driving that far we might as well go to u of a for the install fest
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:20:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:20:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	i asked zach about a game server set up for the ASU event too
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:20:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	so hopefully we'll have that to add to the flyer to further promote the event
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:21:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think that would be a hoot
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:21:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	if we can keep tyche away from it and his mind on business
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:21:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:21:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)

[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:21:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:21:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	cool
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:22:31] <kennymc0>	as long as we dont let the event run too long we should keep him interested enough in his mini to not break anything
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:22:33] <kennymc0>	hee hee
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:22:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	so, we have cds, need to finish up the flyers, rooms are being worked on, what else
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:22:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah flyer distribution and media if possible
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:23:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe we can get gutsygeeks to plug the event
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:23:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:23:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	zach should have some ideas about flyer distribution for the ASU event i think
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:24:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	but we'll still have to do the printing
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:24:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	so keep that in mind
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:24:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	we'll need some volunteers closer to time
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:24:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	what else?

[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:25:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	i don't think we'll need tables and such
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:25:25] <tyche>	cords, routers, power strips, cat5e
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:25:42] <kennymc0>	extra batteries for tyche's camera
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:25:45] <kennymc0>	:)

[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:26:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	especially since kennymc0 has the mind of an elephant

[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:27:00] <kennymc0>	my mind isnt the size of a peanut

[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:30:40] <kennymc0>	oops
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:30:51] <tyche>	Maybe he forgot his batteries.
[Sun Dec 14 2008] [21:31:12] <kennymc0>	that can happen when you are lounging on a lazyboy like that
