__TOC__

For Karmic we are creating a new look for GDM2 (the screen one logs in on). The current design:

<nowiki>[[File:gdm_1.png]]</nowiki>

We need to create a metacity and gtk theme to match this design.

* This is the final design ?
* Well, seeing as how we've already passed the UI Freeze and are creeping up on Artwork Deadline next week, then yeah, I would guess this is probably it (or pretty close, at least). -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:blueyonder64]]</nowiki>
