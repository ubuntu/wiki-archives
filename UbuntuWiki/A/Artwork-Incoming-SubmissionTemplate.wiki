=== Platypus ===

Being a shy but elegant animal, the platypus is often ignored by the Ubuntu artwork community. This must not go on. We need art that can bring the characteristics of this wonderful little animal to Ubuntu.

=== Concept ===
The platypus, is shy, cute and dangerous. An interesting mix. The artwork should be in adorable colours, with a few small, menacing areas. Mostly orange and pink. Touches of danger, can be expressed in small, dark, shapes difficult to define. Make them reminscent of the poisonous hind spur in shape.
