===== Tucson =====

   I will be making contact soon with people in the CS Dept at the University to start planning our next installfest.  We will be needing alot of help.  Please be thinking about doing a presentation, helping with planing, bringing needed power cords and power strips, etc.  The CS dept was very excited about our last installfest because they have migrated to Ubuntu Linux!  As a matter of fact, they billed the event as a Windows Removal Event.  This is a great way to get involved in serving the community.
