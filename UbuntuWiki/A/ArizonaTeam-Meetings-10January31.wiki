[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:09:39] <scott_ev>	that's it for generic stuff
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:09:50] <scott_ev>	We may have a chance to move the venue of the monthly installfest that has been at UAT for the last 1 1/2 yrs.  If it happens, there's a good chance of it being advertised on TV and in the newspaper:  it would be promoted by the city of Tempe.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:10:13] <scott_ev>	This really could be a chance to bring lots of local attention to Open Source Software.  We'll need a volunteer or volunteers to work with PLUG to arrange this if we get the go-ahead.  They suggested we do install fest at both locations for a while before completely switching.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:10:32] <scott_ev>	This sounds like a great idea because we don't want to burn a door with UAT before we know our new venue is actually going to be a good fit.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:10:45] <slofgren>	that is awesome
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:10:45] <scott_ev>	The PLUG guys that are always at installfest seemed to think this could be good, so we aren't stepping on anyone's toes by trying to do this.  I'm bringing this up now, because if it happens, I'd hope our LoCo will represent.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:11:08] <scott_ev>	no kiddin, huh?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:11:10] <xHans>	scott_ev: where to?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:11:14] <scott_ev>	Think about how much fun and productive it could be.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:11:18] <scott_ev>	todd?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:11:34] <scott_ev>	xHans: toddc is working on it
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:11:46] <toddc>	I I will be have more info this week on location
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:11:51] <xHans>	toddc: where to? :)
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:12:04] <scott_ev>	I forget where he said, but it will be big enough and will have brodaband wifi
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:12:17] <toddc>	The city has several locations availible  i need to go look at them
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:12:30] <xHans>	a city-owned location?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:12:30] <scott_ev>	We'll have morfe definite info next week
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:12:35] <scott_ev>	yes
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:12:58] <scott_ev>	xHans: would that be a problem?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:13:21] <xHans>	not really, but I need to know about it :)
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:13:28] <scott_ev>	understood
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:13:40] <scott_ev>	this is in the early pre planning stages
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:13:53] <scott_ev>	like it's almiost too early to mention
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:14:10] <azteech>	is the city looking to go open source, this being their interest in hosting the installfest?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:14:15] <scott_ev>	PLUG will be very very well informed
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:14:15] <SlickMcRunFast>	My taxes are help with install fests?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:14:21] <toddc>	We are looking east tempe to keep it close for west siders
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:14:26] <SlickMcRunFast>	going to
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:14:37] <scott_ev>	SlickMcRunFast: yup
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:14:59] <xHans>	east Tempe for west-side?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:15:02] <SlickMcRunFast>	wow this local goverment might be okay besides taking forever to build roads
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:15:20] <toddc>	west
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:15:45] <scott_ev>	we'll have some more info next week.  So, let's move on
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:15:56] <scott_ev>	There will be a 10.04 Lucid Lynx release party at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe (http://www.bouldersonbroadway.net/) on the 24th of April. Boulders on Broadway has a room upstairs that we will have all to ourselves.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:16:18] <azteech>	the other possibility may be to look at hosting two installfests up there ... on different dates ... one for the new location and the other being at UAT ....
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:16:18] <scott_ev>	We'll have wifi access too.  It's going to be a good chance to eat some good grub, have a few drinks or brewski's and meet some of the other UbuGeeks that you have only met online
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:16:36] <azteech>	we don't want to burn bridges with UAT for hosting ABLEconf ...
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:17:00] <scott_ev>	true. that's something we have to consider
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:17:17] <scott_ev>	we might have to keep dooing installfests there and at the new venue too
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:17:27] <xHans>	two Installfests in the same area would probably not be good
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:17:31] <scott_ev>	if we can get people to show up to help
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:17:58] <xHans>	we won't burn bridges with UAT, but that's why I need to be involved to make sure communication with UAT goes well
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:18:08] <Doorman352>	tempe is a long drive for some....
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:18:23] <scott_ev>	like I said this is just being discussed at this time and no decisiond will be made without alot of planning by us and by PLUG
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:18:34] <Flakeparadigm>	Doorman352: You in Tucson?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:18:36] <xHans>	we could also do an Installfest on the west side, we just need a venue and volunteers :)
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:18:42] <Doorman352>	nope North Phoenix
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:18:48] <azteech>	fully agree that you need to be kept in the loop there xHans ....
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:19:13] <scott_ev>	xHans: you'll know everything that happens long before anything happens
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:19:26] <Flakeparadigm>	Doorman352: Ah, the other direction of far away.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:19:27] <xHans>	Doorman352: same for north Phx :)
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:19:27] <azteech>	Flakeparadigm ...Crymson is from tucson ...
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:19:35] <Flakeparadigm>	ah
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:20:07] <scott_ev>	don't worry.  we're just trying to help bring Open Source stuff to llarger audience and not wanting to do anything hasty
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:20:09] <Doorman352>	perhaps rotating them...
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:20:18] <scott_ev>	lots of planning would have to go into this
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:20:48] <scott_ev>	nothing is going to happen this week but some recon....
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:20:50] <azteech>	agreed, lots of planning, and coordination will have to be done to make this effective, and successful ...
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:21:03] <xHans>	Doorman352: we don't want to rotate the monthly Installfest, but we could do a quarterly Installfest in different parts of the Valley
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:21:28] <Doorman352>	just a suggestion for those who wont drive as far....
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:22:00] <scott_ev>	In time that might happen...
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:22:10] <scott_ev>	on to other business, ok
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:22:16] <scott_ev>	There will be a 10.04 Lucid Lynx release party at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe (http://www.bouldersonbroadway.net/) on the 24th of April. Boulders on Broadway has a room upstairs that we will have all to ourselves.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:22:29] <scott_ev>	We'll have wifi access too.  It's going to be a good chance to eat some good grub, have a few drinks or brewski's and meet some of the other UbuGeeks that you have only met online.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:22:40] <scott_ev>	You're not going to want to miss this.  Ok, that brings up another point:  We need volunteers for a couple of things:  we'll need a few extension cords and power strips.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:22:53] <scott_ev>	Who's planning on attending that can help out with that?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:23:07] <scott_ev>	an projector setup would be a real score too
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:23:16] <scott_ev>	anyone have one we could use?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:23:21] <toddc>	y
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:23:28] <scott_ev>	excellent
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:23:39] <scott_ev>	Someone can pick out new features in 10.04 and present them or concentrate on one for example.  Anything to do with Ubuntu will be OK.  Things like how to navigate Launchpad and report bugs...
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:23:50] <Doorman352>	I have one as well, not sure about schedule...
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:23:54] <scott_ev>	Actually, if you have a favorite piece of software that you use you can present that even if it's not in Ubuntu's repos.  Please be thinking about this.  It will only make the Release Party more of a success.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:24:04] <xHans>	scott_ev: I have plenty of extension cords and power strips to loan
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:24:07] <scott_ev>	kk, we have time to work it out
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:24:21] <scott_ev>	xHans: ok than I'll quit asking
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:24:22] <xHans>	green extension cords tend to be really cheap at the beginning of January every year....
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:24:29] <scott_ev>	and will make arrqngements with you
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:24:39] <Doorman352>	I can bring PowerPoint..... [Ducks]
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:24:40] <scott_ev>	true
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:24:46] <scott_ev>	hahaha
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:24:51] <scott_ev>	you better run
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:25:04] <odameyer>	hit the door Doorman352
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:25:12] <scott_ev>	we only have one presentation comitted so far, but there will be a few more
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:25:18] <scott_ev>	Actually, if you have a favorite piece of software that you use you can present that even if it's not in Ubuntu's repos.  Please be thinking about this.  It will only make the Release Party more of a success.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:25:19] <tyche>	PowerPoint?  Isn't that a pen?
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:25:34] <scott_ev>	Here is a link to the Lucid Lynx planning page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/LucidLynx  Feel free to add to the ideas section or fill in anything that might be missing
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:25:36] <odameyer>	tyche: don't you use quills
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:25:47] <scott_ev>	We will be heading there from the monthly installfest at UAT. http://tinyurl.com/yemru26 If you've never been to an installfest at UAT, you may want to consider checking it out.  Our LoCo co-sponsors it with PLUG but we are poorly represented.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:25:56] <ghopper>	I also have a projector, if you need a backup.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:25:56] <scott_ev>	There's a proposed flyer posted at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1388113 please give us your feedback in the form of a vote with coments if needed.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:26:01] <scott_ev>	nice
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:26:23] <scott_ev>	at this point all I want to know is that we're covered
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:26:34] <scott_ev>	we'll sort out details closer tot he event
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:26:51] <scott_ev>	It's a chance to help another linux user or, better yet, possibly install Linux an a computer that currently is running that other OS.
[Sunday 31 January 2010] [21:27:03] <scott_ev>	http://azloco.com/node/120
