'''An icon set to go along with the Peace theme'''

== Screenshot ==
<nowiki>[[File:peace-icons-rev1.png]]</nowiki>
In the screenshot above, you can see the subtle color shifting I have done to some of the Gnome icons to make them fit better with the Peace palette.  A little less gray, and a bit more tan.
