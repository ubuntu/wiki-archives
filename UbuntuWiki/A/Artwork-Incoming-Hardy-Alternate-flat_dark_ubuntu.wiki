== Dark Flat Seamless Ubuntu ==

This is a theme I've been developing and tweaking for my own personal use for a while. It can be replicated by using the color settings of the glossy theme and making a simple emerald theme using the legacy engine.

=== Concept ===
Made to be an attractive, usable, dark theme based off of the Ubuntu colors.

==== Reference ====
I had originally based this off of the ubuntu studio theme, so they deserve some credit.
