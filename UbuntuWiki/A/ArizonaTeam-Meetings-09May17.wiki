21:03 < Jazzy_Jeff> no, my third
21:03 < tyche> Um . . . Old age, again, johnc4510?
21:03 < Jazzy_Jeff> hehe
21:03 < johnc4510> yeah
21:03 < johnc4510> lol
21:03 < johnc4510> ok, any new members then
21:04 < johnc4510> if not, on to announcements
21:04 < johnc4510> .
21:04 < tyche> Now THAT'S the safe way to do it.  Hee hee
21:04 < johnc4510> yep
21:04 < johnc4510> Karmic Koala Alpha 1 Released: Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 1 has been released. Pre-releases of Karmic are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stablesystem or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage. This release consists only of the alternate and server CDs; the desktopCD will follow in the next Alpha release.
21:04 < johnc4510> Ubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/karmic/alpha-1/
21:04 < johnc4510> Kubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/karmic/alpha-1/
21:04 < johnc4510> Xubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/karmic/alpha-1/
21:05 < johnc4510> ok, unless your a developer i would suggest not installing this early release
21:05 < johnc4510> you'll have lots of problems usually
21:05 < johnc4510> but it's great to see another new version in the works
21:06 < johnc4510> final release will be in October
21:06 < johnc4510> :)
21:06 < johnc4510> Landscape 1.3 released: Landscape is the package that allows server and desktop administrators to maintain Ubuntu on physical, or virtual servers, and to more easily manage their deployments. The new release, Landscape 1.3, also makes that service available to the Amazon EC2 cloud. Landscape is available as part of the commercial support package, or as a stand-alone service. http://www.ubuntu.com/news/manage-ubuntu-server-in-amazon-ec2-c
21:06 < johnc4510> ok, server pkgs are getting more user friendly with every release
21:07 < johnc4510> i think before too long it will be easy for the non geek to run his/her own server
21:07 < johnc4510> turnkey is another server product that is making it easier
21:08 < johnc4510> Ubuntu Podcast #28: http://ubuntupodcast.net/
21:08 < johnc4510> WorksWithU Vodcast: Episode #1 - http://www.workswithu.com/2009/05/11/workswithu-vodcast-episode-1/
21:08 < johnc4510> nick and josh have been asked to expand and are now doing workswithu podcasts
21:09 < johnc4510> they are entertaining
21:09 < tyche> Are they getting paid for it?
21:09 < johnc4510> and nick is a big person in the community
21:09 < johnc4510> tyche: i doubt it
21:09 < johnc4510> lol
21:09 < johnc4510> are you?
21:09 < johnc4510> :)
21:09 < tyche> Josh is a bigger person.  But not necessarily in the community.  Hee hee
21:10 < johnc4510> right
21:10 < tyche> Laurel and Hardy.
21:10 < johnc4510> ok, Jeff_Martin has a great idea for our future installfests
21:10 < johnc4510> Jeff Martin: Live streaming of installfests and other team events
21:10 < johnc4510> via ustream
21:10 < johnc4510> Jeff_Martin: you around?
21:10 < Jazzy_Jeff> that would be cool
21:11 < johnc4510> nods
21:11 < Jeff_Martin> Live Video Broadcast: InstallFest live feeds, with a small amount of preparation, we could run live video from our install festivals -- that is live from Tucson, PHX, and anywhere else we desire.
21:11 < johnc4510> :)
21:11 < johnc4510> do you still have the one up you had earlier today?
21:11 < Jeff_Martin> You can see examples of live feeds at http://www.ustream.tv
21:11 < johnc4510> ah
21:11 < Jazzy_Jeff> install fest Hawaii  :)
21:12 < word> *sneeze* +1
21:12 < Jeff_Martin> The one I had earlier was live, but it is not running now
21:12 < johnc4510> word: hey
21:12 < johnc4510> k
21:12 < tyche> And, for some reason, it won't see my camera on the Mini 9
21:12 < johnc4510> hmmm
21:12 < johnc4510> tyche: is that a preinstalled webcam?
21:12 < tyche> Cheese does.  But USTREAM doesn't
21:13 < tyche> Yep
21:13 < Jeff_Martin> Ustream.tv has many little gadgets that you can use: polls, scrolling text, video in video
21:13 < johnc4510> hmmmm
21:13 < johnc4510> Jeff_Martin: do you think we need a dedicated box to do that??
21:14 < Jeff_Martin> I would suggest a desktop, it sure gives my laptop a workout
21:14 < johnc4510> i figured
21:15 < johnc4510> ok, well, i think it's a great idea and something extra to promote for the event
21:15 < johnc4510> ??
21:15 < johnc4510> tyche: ?
21:15 < tyche> +1
21:15 < johnc4510> k

21:15 < Jazzy_Jeff> +1
21:15 < johnc4510> well, lets try it then
21:16 < johnc4510> :)
21:16 < johnc4510> Jeff_Martin: do we need an account at ustream?
21:16 < johnc4510> or any extra software installed?
21:16 < Jeff_Martin> accounts are easy to setup
21:17 < Jeff_Martin> and it works with FF and Flash10
21:17 < tyche> I'll say they are.  Even *I* could set one up.
21:17 < johnc4510> ah ok
21:17 < johnc4510> lol
21:17 < azmike> lo0l
21:17 < azmike> lol
21:17 < tyche> johnc4510: I'll help you through it, if you have trouble.  Hee hee
21:17 < johnc4510> that settles it, if tyche can do it, _maybe_ i can rofl
21:17 < johnc4510> lol
21:17 < Jeff_Martin> I think there is a trick to the cam setup, and I will write a how to ( for you tyche )
21:17 < johnc4510> lol
21:18 < tyche> Jeff_Martin: Thanks
21:18 < johnc4510> Jeff_Martin: thx for poking tyche
