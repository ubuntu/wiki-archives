Server: Freenode: IRC Channel #ubuntu-arizona

Greetings to everyone and welcome to the first edition of the Ubuntu-Arizona LoCo newsletter. I'm learning on the fly here, so I'm glad no one is within throwing distance, or I might be toast. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, please feel free to toss them my way. Via email of course. Seriously, anything at all folks.

Before I go any further, I want to acknowledge and thank Steve Stalcup, aka Vorian, and Aaron Toponce, aka atoponce. Both Steve and  Aaron are mentors for the Ubuntu loco teams. As you know, both dropped by to see what was going on, and to offer their assistance. What most of you don't know is that both Steve and Aaron went out of their way to help me get registered to have op status on the Ubuntu-Arizona channel. I'm sure I speak for everyone when I express our thanks and invite them to join us anytime.

Summary of last meeting
April 22, 2007

As usual, we started out with the chit chat before the actual meeting started. What follows is a very brief summary of the agenda:

1. Introductions: were made by all in attendance. 10 people total, up from 5 the previous week. Breakdown by area is as follows: Phoenix/Tempe-2, Tucson-6, Ohio-1 and Yuma-1.

2. Feisty upgrade: looks like most everyone who upgraded did so without much trouble other than minor problems or bugs that had already been known and reported. The general feeling was that Feisty was another hit for Ubuntu and therefore a hit for us as well. :D

3. How to convert more people to Ubuntu: many ideas were tossed around without us coming to any real decision about the whole matter. It was decided that we would all think on it some more, and try to come up with better ideas for this weeks meeting. Keep this in the back of your minds folks, it won't go away.

4. Programing: we didn't seem to have all that much expertise in this department, but that shouldn't deter us. More people will be joining our small, but highly motivated group. The odds are good that someone down the line will have the knowledge we need to perhaps start a project in programming.

5. Games: some of us game, and some of us don't. Some of us only game with linux based games, and others think we need to learn Wine/Cedega to attract gamers. I'm going to suggest that we ask for 2 volunteers from the team at the this weeks meeting to look into Wine/Cedega, and report back to the team as to the best option for the team to pursue.

Two announcements before I close out this (for lack of a better term) newsletter:

1. We briefly discussed whether we could get a bulk quantity of Feisty CD's. I went to the shipit site to order my allotment of CD's, and there was a place where you could request a special allotment. This allotment would have to be for a convention or install fest or something similar. There was no guarantee that they would honor the order, but if the special event was worth it, I think they would do their best. Something to keep in mind for the future, if need be.

2. After the meeting, I took one last shot at sending private messages to any and everyone who had posted to the loco forum, but had not responded. I sent a total of 28 messages on Sunday evening. So far, I have had responses from 5 people. I think we can expect another increase of participants at this weeks meeting. :D:D

So long for now, I've got to go figure out what I'm going to come up with for the next newsletter :(
