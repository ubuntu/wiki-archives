=== About Me ===
I am a 24 year old Software programmer/Security Researcher/Mathematician who dabbles in a plethora of programming languages to get his work done. I am currently about to finish my Master's thesis on cryptanalysis of hash functions, and have about 2 year experience of IT Security.

I have been using a variety of *nix flavours for the past few years, though haven't been able to get my hands for a long duration on a Mac. I am using a lot of architectures, ranging from sparc to AMD64, and keep alternating depending upon my mood and time restrictions.

** Member of the Ubuntu Forums since September 11th, 2008

=== My Contributions to the Ubuntu Community ===
* I try and help my peers, and friends regarding their doubts about *nix (though thanks to the extensive existing documentation, and forums of Ubuntu, I usually end up helping them with their BSD or OpenSolaris installations).
* I try and encourage my friends who are Windows O.S. users about the benefits of using FOSS.
* Install and test the bleeding-edge Software and/or O.S. releases.  

=== Ubuntu Beginners Team ===
* Padawan on the <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam|Ubuntu Beginners Team]]</nowiki>, and hope to be a full-time member of the team in the near future.

=== Future Plans & Projects ===
* I wish to start some kernel hacking soon. Sounds pretty awesome ;)
* I hope to being a member of the Ubuntu Beginners team Security focus group.
