=== Interests ===
* Gnome. I've been a Gnome user since the late 1.x days and haven't lost my love.
* Packaging.  I've done quite a few packages as my role as an Ubuntu MOTU, and am always looking for more places to help out.  I really enjoy all that I've done though I just wish I had more time to dedicate to the project.
* I plan to help out more actively in the LoCo DetroitTeam.

=== Ubuntu Goals ===
* I'm looking for a way to help out.  E-mail me if you know of some way that I could assist!

=== Time Available ===
* Usually a few hours a day, though I wish I could dedicate more.
