[18:45:54] <Kilos> yes philipballew please do for the records
[18:46:02] <zxsinclair> though that site is in need of updating
[18:46:09] <philipballew> QA I am Philip Ballew USA - California - Local Community
[18:46:09] <QA> philipballew: Yessir
[18:46:16] <inetpro> let's try to stick to the Agenda at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AfricanTeams/Meetings/20150729
[18:46:16] <inetpro> we can always discuss the site and other info later
[18:46:37] <Kilos> zxsinclair  i think all other sites should link to this one dont you?
[18:46:50] <Kilos> inetpro  sorry sir
[18:47:01] <pieter2627> inetpro: what is our current topic?
[18:47:12] <inetpro> Kilos: you're the boss sir :-)
[18:47:16] <zxsinclair> Kilos: sure thing - am not sure if anyone from Zim Loco is here?
[18:47:28] <inetpro> pieter2627: we're still on just welcoming... guess we should move on
[18:47:30] - magespawn online
[18:47:38] <Kilos> non at meetings the chair wields the hammer
[18:47:48] - qwebirc48566 online
[18:47:54] <Stevdok_> So what the agenda for the day, hope I've not missed that yet
[18:48:02] <Kilos> hi qwebirc48566 welcome
[18:48:10] <inetpro> QA: topic Get more Africa Linux users to join us
[18:48:10] <QA> Current Topic: Get more Africa Linux users to join us
[18:48:13] * pieter2627 wonders how we are gonna cramp all the items in 1 hour
[18:48:21] <veddox> Stevdok_: here's the agenda https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AfricanTeams/Meetings/20150729
[18:48:31] <inetpro> pieter2627: gonna be tough, I know
[18:48:40] <Kilos> whew
[18:48:42] * Cryterion agrees
[18:49:01] <Stevdok_> Thanks
[18:49:11] <inetpro> our agenda might be a bit unstructured as well but we have to start somewhere
[18:49:22] <Kilos> well guys we stretched a continent, we can stretch our first meeting
[18:49:24] <raywan> Send out invitations to the different lug mailinglists
[18:49:36] <nasowah_> Ok /inetpro good so where do we start from ...
[18:49:44] <veddox> shall we move on to "Get more Africa Linux users to join us"?
[18:49:52] <K_K_N> speaking of getting more Africa Linux users to join how do we do that I know some who use Linux but can never convince them to join these channels?
[18:49:54] <veddox> that would be the next point, would it not?
[18:50:07] <pieter2627> the idea of raywan seems good
[18:50:15] <Kilos> ohi veddox sorry, didnt see you
[18:50:23] <raywan> I think the problem is exposure,
[18:50:26] <inetpro> the Agenda is pretty much drafted by you guys... I'm not sure who added the above metioned item, Kilos?
[18:50:29] - renemanasse_ online
[18:50:39] <mhall119> K_K_N: how about mailing lists, or forums?
[18:50:41] <Kilos> hi renemanasse_
[18:50:46] <Kilos> um
[18:50:51] <renemanasse_> hi Kilos
[18:51:00] <pieter2627> veddox: we are already there
[18:51:08] <veddox> good :-)
[18:51:08] - nj3ma online
[18:51:11] <K_K_N> mhall119: hmm.. good idea maybe I will suggest that to them
[18:51:11] <Kilos> someone used our basic za agenda for a base to work from
[18:51:26] <inetpro> mhall119: good point.. we have registerd ourselves at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AfricanTeams
[18:51:50] <inetpro> oops... wrong link
[18:52:06] <Kilos> mhall119  we have a mailing list on lp https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-africa
[18:52:28] <Kilos> ive never used forums so didnt even think about it
[18:52:31] <mhall119> Kilos: yup, just saw that, some people are more willing to subscribe and participate in email rather than IRC
[18:52:36] <inetpro> Kilos: thanks
[18:52:45] <K_K_N> I think we should also look at maybe converting some of the Linux users who are not ubuntu users to maybe also start using ubuntu
[18:52:46] <Kilos> np
[18:52:53] <mhall119> Kilos: you can use either forums.ubuntu.com or discourse.ubuntu.com (which has a LoCo Teams sectio)
[18:53:06] <veddox> K_K_N: I'm not sure I agree with that
[18:53:13] <Kilos> cool ty mhall119
[18:53:16] <veddox> presumably they know why they are not using ubuntu
[18:53:17] <raywan> if we let the different groups know we exist, I think more users will join us
[18:53:36] - lafricain online
[18:53:36] <raywan> the first step would be identifying the different groups
[18:53:48] <Kilos> K_K_N  the idea here is firstly to make friends with all linux users
[18:53:51] <raywan> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AfricanTeams is a starting point
[18:53:55] <inetpro> QA: idea <mhall119> Kilos: you can use either forums.ubuntu.com or discourse.ubuntu.com (which has a LoCo Teams sectio)
[18:53:55] <QA> Idea recorded: <mhall119> Kilos: you can use either forums.ubuntu.com or discourse.ubuntu.com (which has a LoCo Teams sectio)
[18:54:03] <Kilos> there are many lugs with ubuntu users in
[18:54:08] - qwebirc56634 online
[18:54:11] <K_K_N> and also get the people who are using version of other commercial OS which are not so legal since they did not even purchase the software to start using ubuntu, its free and they would then not be breaking an laws
[18:54:31] <K_K_N> yep I agree Kilos
[18:54:35] <zxsinclair> does anyone have any idea of how many companies that actively use any *buntu distro
[18:54:43] <veddox> K_K_N: that I do agree with :-)
[18:54:51] <Na3iL> we'll inform Ubuntu african users and LUGs in africa by social media, I think it's the better way to get guys/gals to here.. and as I see we don't have an account/page on social media
[18:54:59] <zxsinclair> in Zim I know that Holiday Inn used to but have no contact info
[18:55:25] <zxsinclair> thinking that if you get companies involved somehow to "spread the word"
[18:55:35] <Cryterion> Na3iL https://www.facebook.com/groups/494775420686780/
[18:55:39] <Na3iL> Also, we can apply the same project as StartUbuntu by converting and migrating users to switch to Ubuntu..
[18:55:40] <nwc> i run an internet cafe in harare that is running about 10 ubuntu machines
[18:55:41] <veddox> A couple of schools in Zambia used/still do/are planning to switch to Ubuntu
[18:55:46] <Neo31> zxsinclair, can you be more specific?
[18:55:51] <Na3iL> Cryterion, a group is not what we need
[18:55:52] <K_K_N> veddox: I did not mean that Linux users should abandon there current Linux distro just maybe start using ubuntu to become familiar and maybe start assisting us newbies when help is needed
[18:55:54] <Neo31> how companies can help ?
[18:56:27] <zxsinclair> Neo31: just thinking aloud that there might be more ppl using in than we know
[18:56:51] <zxsinclair> and could assist to "advertise" their choice of OS
[18:56:57] <veddox> Cryterion: thumbs up for the FB group
[18:57:06] <munro> Neo31 in Zimbabwe, we convinced an ISP to host the local repo and fund launch aprties
[18:57:17] <Kilos> i am sure there are ubuntu users all over the world that know nothing about irc or that there are teams all over
[18:57:17] <QA> Kilos: Done
[18:57:18] <veddox> K_K_N thanks for the clarification
[18:57:30] <K_K_N> veddox: no problem
[18:57:31] <Kilos> ai!

[18:57:58] <h0912> thanks
[18:58:23] <inetpro> clearly there's lots more we can do to improve visbility and get new users
[18:58:37] <nwc> i suggest first strengthening the local teams. the africa team can drive local teams that is the only way we can get more users. locally we can influence our peers
[18:58:38] * Kilos agrees
[18:58:43] <Na3iL> Besides, I think we should make LoCo teams in Africa to add in their official wiki page a category of Ubuntu africa..
[18:58:51] <mhall119> translations are a good way to both encourage local participation and make Ubuntu more appealing to local users
[18:58:52] <veddox> have we announced the group on the Ubuntu forums?
[18:59:12] <zabear> QA I am Rusty Beukes  South Africa  local
[18:59:12] <QA> zabear: Alrighty
[18:59:15] <raywan> How about a website that introduces such groups to irc, and the different local teams around them?
[18:59:17] <h0912> QA: i am Thomas POKAM - Cameroun
[18:59:17] <QA> h0912: Alrighty
[18:59:35] <pieter2627> to me it seems that each of us has a medium(facebook, lists, irc, etc) that we are familiar with. Shouldn't each focus on the users within their medium?
[18:59:38] <zxsinclair> nwc: you are on the zwubuntu mailing list?
[18:59:41] <Kilos> hi zabear
[18:59:50] <inetpro> shall we move on to the next point... otherwise we might never finish
[18:59:50] <klem__> QA I am Gustave NIAMKE  Ivory Coast  local
[18:59:50] <QA> klem__: Sure
[18:59:52] <Neo31> mhall119, I think we might be lacking more of a great marketing strategies in Africa
[19:00:07] * Cryterion agrees with pieter2627
[19:00:09] - otenh online
[19:00:18] <Neo31> Ubuntu has the right tools (including translation) but we still should work more on marketing in Africa
[19:00:23] <lafricain> hy, I saw a team in DRCongo with RenÃ© ManassÃ© GALEKWA. someone knows where he stay?
[19:00:25] * Na3iL agrees with Neo31 
[19:00:28] <mhall119> Neo31: we've never had "great marketing strategies" anywhere in the world, it's all been loco teams and local enthusiasts
[19:00:30] <otenh> Hi guys what have I missed
[19:00:36] <Kilos> mhall119  i agree but this will grow like wild fire now
[19:00:36] <inetpro> I think oom Kilos started a great initiative
[19:00:36] * inetpro suggests keeping the ball rolling
[19:00:42] <Benno-007> Yesterday I read a book over open souce in schools to the end. In Europe in Switzerland and Austria there is a debian linux stick project for some schools: http://lernstick.educa.ch/de/bezug-anleitungen I think the first link there (4 GB) is with English programs, too. So all pupils have there own system on there own stick for all computers where they can boot them.
[19:01:05] <K_K_N> I have a questions how can companies become involved? Do you think its possible for them to make money by suggesting ubuntu and other Free Open Source Software and Solutions to their clients?
[19:01:44] <veddox> K_K_N it's an intrigueing idea - would it work?
[19:01:49] <mhall119> K_K_N: we have some hardware companies that sell devices with Ubuntu, others that provide support for Ubuntu (and Edubuntu for schools)
[19:02:12] <Neo31> I think the best thing to do is to go to the end user, which we usually and mostly find on social media. We can bring them to a website with an iframe for IRC and more interesting stuff then.
[19:02:18] <mhall119> also non-profits that like to use Ubuntu and FOSS to help their communities
[19:02:29] <veddox> Neo31 I like that!
[19:02:34] <Cryterion> It's the hardware systems you can do, keeping the cost down with ubuntu!
[19:02:43] <pieter2627> veddox: i don't think the group has been announced on the forum
[19:02:44] <zxsinclair> Neo31: I like the "irc frame" thing
[19:02:57] <Neo31> yep
[19:03:09] <ongolaBoy> mhall119: yep some non-profits (like where I work ) use only ubuntu for their workstation in Africa ;)
[19:03:12] <Neo31> I mean whatever is easy for a new Ubuntu user
[19:03:16] <veddox> pieter2627 I think that would be an important avenue to pursue - many users end up on the forums at some point
[19:03:20] <mhall119> Neo31: is right, social media posts, blogs, youtube videos, podcasts, etc are all great ways of attracting the attention of end users
[19:03:27] <lafricain> K_K_N, I don't know about companies, but for particular person it can give job, the big problem is viruses on windows.
[19:03:52] <inetpro> QA: accepted keep suggestions coming to improve visibility and sign up new users
[19:03:52] <QA> Accepted: keep suggestions coming to improve visibility and sign up new users
[19:03:54] <otenh> Guys u are going too fast for me to keep up
[19:03:56] <lafricain> The important is formation to use.
[19:04:02] <inetpro> QA: topic Get more Ubuntu users to apply for official membership
[19:04:02] <QA> Current Topic: Get more Ubuntu users to apply for official membership
[19:04:14] <Kilos> lol me too
[19:04:18] <otenh> Ok
[19:04:20] <lafricain> For me too...
[19:04:22] <renemanasse_> ok
[19:04:23] <inetpro> I think this topic speaks for itself and is very related to the previous one
[19:04:36] <Cryterion> yep
[19:04:39] <gremble> What is the significance of official membership?
[19:04:44] <veddox> don't you need to show a high level of community engagement to be accepted for membership?
[19:04:46] <Na3iL> yup we should endorse our selves by leaving testimonials..
[19:04:46] <otenh> I think the best way is education
[19:05:11] <lafricain> HÃ© renemanasse_ t'es de RDC!
[19:05:12] <Kilos> gremble  maybe mhall119 can answer
[19:05:12] <mhall119> veddox: you need to show significant and sustained contributions to Ubuntu, it doesn't necessarily have to be community engagement
[19:05:16] * ongolaBoy has set his draft for membership .. still pending :)
[19:05:16] <philipballew> I think to get more visibility following more people on the social media accounts is not a bad idea.
[19:05:19] <Na3iL> gremble, â†’ https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/NewMember
[19:05:22] <philipballew> I can do that probably
[19:05:23] <nwc> bundling applications that are relevant to our targets, companies or schools can increase ubuntu usage
[19:05:29] <pieter2627> Neo31 veddox zxsinclair the irc frame is already on the site as far as i know
[19:05:40] * inetpro still needs to sign up his self
[19:05:40] <inetpro> the certificate signed by sabdfl himself will be a nice one to have
[19:05:57] <mhall119> gremble: there are some perks to being a Member, such as an @ubuntu.com email address, IRC cloak, I think LWN subscription, and you can use the community donations fund to get money for Ubuntu-related events and stuff
[19:06:06] <Kilos> mine is framed already
[19:06:09] <zxsinclair> pieter2627: which one of the sites, we have mentioned several during discussion
[19:06:10] <veddox> pieter2627 great!
[19:06:16] <mhall119> it's also a good way to highlight and thank the people who are doing good work for Ubuntu as a whole
[19:06:21] <Neo31> yep pieter2627 but we could think of more tricks to makes the entry level for new users even easier ;)
[19:06:42] <veddox> zxsinclair ubuntu-africa.info
[19:06:48] <mhall119> also, Ubuntu Members get to vote in the Community Council elections
[19:06:56] <otenh> Last week I passed through he'll
[19:07:27] <otenh> Last week I passed through hell trying to install ubuntu for a friend
[19:07:29] <veddox> well personally I do plan to apply for Membership, but I feel I really don't have enough experience/contributions yet
[19:07:31] <zxsinclair> veddox: you right, it is first time I see this site so did not notice
[19:07:40] <otenh> The touch pad was not working
[19:07:56] <inetpro> QA: accepted Official Membership is a good way to highlight and thank the people who are doing good work for Ubuntu as a whole
[19:07:56] <QA> Accepted: Official Membership is a good way to highlight and thank the people who are doing good work for Ubuntu as a whole
[19:07:58] <mhall119> the best thing anybody can do to get people to become members is to (A) help them find a good place to contribute and (B) write a testimonial for them on their wiki page
[19:08:17] <otenh> I think these are some of the thinks that scare off New comers
[19:08:24] <veddox> otenh: a common problem, but one that should be discussed on the forums?
[19:08:44] <Kilos> otenh  thats why we are here to help newcomers
[19:08:48] <mhall119> otenh: did you teach your friend how to use Launchpad to file bug reports?
[19:08:49] <veddox> mhall119 the forums are a good place to start contributing, imo
[19:08:51] <mhall119> :)
[19:09:09] <Kilos> we just need to make ourselves more visible to them
[19:09:12] <mhall119> veddox: we have lots of good places to start, it mostly depends on the skills and interests of the contributor
[19:09:18] <otenh> Yes
[19:09:34] <genova> veddox: discussed on the forums, more better
[19:09:35] <otenh> I filled it for him
[19:09:41] <Benno-007> In the "western world" there are Ubuntu phones since some months. I think they could help to diffuse Ubuntu later, on PC, too. But maybe in Africa they are too expensive in comparement with Firefox OS or Android.
[19:09:49] <inetpro> next?
[19:10:02] <inetpro> QA: topic Help to find the missing/tired LoCo's https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AfricanTeams
[19:10:02] <QA> Current Topic: Help to find the missing/tired LoCo's https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AfricanTeams
[19:10:04] <veddox> mhall119 true, what others would you recommend with a low entry barrier?
[19:10:04] <mhall119> Benno-007: not in the Americas there aren't
[19:10:05] <klem__> i agree with genova
[19:10:20] - Stevdok online
[19:10:21] <Neo31> I think to help new people get into contribution is small group mentoring (2 to 3 people)
[19:10:23] <otenh> Yes benno-007
[19:10:24] <Kilos> inetpro  i think there are 2 to find only
[19:10:35] <mhall119> veddox: docs are a good one, they don't require technical skills, Translations are another
[19:10:37] <zabear> Reaching Africa also have to do with communication - a large part of Africa speaks French and another part communicates in English. Is there a way to reach the French speaking part?
[19:10:40] <inetpro> Kilos: these topics are all related
[19:10:47] <Kilos> ah
[19:10:53] <Kilos> sorry
[19:10:55] <otenh> I would love to have one of the ubuntu phone but can't fine one to buy in Ghana
[19:10:55] <Neo31> If we can make an mentoring thing official more people will feel it is easier to start instead of getting scared
[19:11:02] <veddox> zabear: good point
[19:11:13] <renemanasse_> god ideaa
[19:11:14] <Kilos> read them quick and drop what you think is covered
[19:11:30] <Stevdok> Sorry am on mobile
[19:11:30] <Stevdok> We here in Accra meet every Saturday(Linux users) where we help new users come to terms with the new environments, we all help user to install and help win new users, current we encourage other regions to form their own user communities with the current one been (unilinux) a user group at the university of Ghana , we hoping to reach out to all universities soon
[19:12:06] <Kilos> Stevdok  keep it up
[19:12:24] <mhall119> zabear: the ubuntu-fr LoCo team is active in French-speaking regions outside of France itself, they can probably help
[19:12:25] <eebrah> QA: I an Ibrahim from Kenya
[19:12:25] <QA> eebrah: *blink*
[19:12:25] <pieter2627> zabear: a few of the users here speak french and covers that part
[19:12:26] <genova> Stevdok: good job
[19:12:33] <eebrah> QA: I am Ibrahim from Kenya
[19:12:33] <QA> eebrah: Righto

[19:13:09] <Kilos> welcome to ubuntu-africa
[19:13:18] <veddox> do we have any way of contacting members of dead locos?
[19:13:31] <chaker> Kilos: Thanks :)
[19:13:35] <Kilos> we have contacted most of them veddox
[19:13:40] <Neo31> zabear, We speak french in north africa ubuntu-tn ;)
[19:13:47] <veddox> kilos: good job!
[19:13:48] <philipballew> the old loco leads email should still be in the portal
[19:14:04] <Neo31> there is also ubuntu morocco
[19:14:12] <PabloRubianes> philipballew:yes but contact them is kind of hard to get an answer
[19:14:12] <philipballew> if not, I am sure we can track them down with a google search
[19:14:23] <genova> here in dakar most training school and university work on ubuntu 40%
[19:14:29] <philipballew> PabloRubianes, thats very valid.
[19:14:30] <Kilos> i have had contact with someone in morocco
[19:14:32] <zxsinclair> at least you got hold of a few us in Zimbabwe and we have gone very quiet lately
[19:14:35] <zxsinclair> read inactive
[19:14:37] <Neo31> two approved loco teams at least speak french and will be happy to help zabear
[19:15:11] <veddox> short questions: anybody Zambian here? We don't have a LoCo team, it seems
[19:15:11] <klem__> genova: will need your contact cause planning to do soimething like that in cote d ivoire
[19:15:29] <Kilos> zabear  the tunisians have been very helpful from the beginning
[19:15:55] - Fatar online
[19:16:04] <zxsinclair> veddox: you in Zambia?
[19:16:05] <mhall119> Kilos: daker is in Morocco
[19:16:35] <genova> klem__: I had to meet linux pensioners frome Ivory Coast
[19:16:42] <Kilosty> ai!
[19:16:53] <veddox> zxsinclair: let's say I was in Zambia when I joined ubuntu-africa. Currently in Germany.
[19:16:57] * inetpro would love to see many more countries represented on the map at http://people.ubuntu.com/~chilicuil/ubuntumembers-map.html
[19:17:23] <genova> klem__: it would be a pleasure if I can help
[19:17:31] <klem__> genevo: sure will manage to do that
[19:17:51] <Kilos> oh elacheche was doing the map but been a bit busy to get it done in time
[19:17:55] * ongolaBoy will request some testimonials after this meeting :)
[19:18:22] <pieter2627> Kilos: map of?
[19:18:38] <Kilos> africa showing where users are
[19:18:39] <zabear> I see a number of French speakers here. Do we need to have a Ubuntu-Africa page for both English and French so that French speaking Africa can follow what is happening on the web?
[19:18:47] <Kilos> http://people.ubuntu.com/~chilicuil/ubuntumembers-map.html
[19:19:06] <veddox> zabear: I would second that, a translation seems to be the polite thing to do
[19:19:08] <Neo31> zabear, That is a good idea I think
[19:19:31] <Kilos> if you guys look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AfricanTeams
[19:19:41] <Kilos> you will see you can choose languages
[19:19:42] <veddox> would somebody volunteer to translate the ubuntu-africa.info page to french?
[19:19:44] <Neo31> Some Tunisians would scare and get off any thing in English
[19:20:00] <Kilos> oh you mean the site
[19:20:06] <renemanasse_> why we have not users in DRC on the maps???
[19:20:16] <Neo31> and most African locos either speak English or French
[19:20:17] <genova> zabear: why notif the French do the translation work
[19:20:34] <pieter2627> if we are going to trans, will we also cover arabi(another popular african lang)?
[19:20:45] <Na3iL> sure pieter2627
[19:20:46] <Kilos> the map maintainer cant do it anymore renemanasse_ so we have a new guy taken over
[19:20:48] <genova> pieter2627: yes
[19:20:51] <inetpro> QA: idea discuss creating more sub teams grouped by language
[19:20:51] <QA> Idea recorded: discuss creating more sub teams grouped by language
[19:20:55] <veddox> might as well add kiswahili
[19:20:58] <klem__> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AfricanTeams/Fr french already there it seems
[19:21:10] <ongolaBoy> veddox: I can help in translation sometimes :)
[19:21:15] <Neo31> pieter2627, I would vote for English and French only. more effort might be a distraction for now
[19:21:33] <Kilos> and arabic i think
[19:21:34] <inetpro> time really moving too quickly... nice to see the active discussion and all the ideas
[19:21:46] <R0ok__> veddox: most Swahili speakers are pretty much fluent in English too
[19:21:47] <Kilos> Na3iL  thats your section
[19:21:48] <veddox> let's take the discussion on translations to the mailing list
[19:21:54] <klem__> by language will be great
[19:22:06] <inetpro> moving on...
[19:22:06] <Na3iL> yup Kilos I can handle Arabic Neo31 u know :P
[19:22:09] <inetpro> QA: topic Events
[19:22:09] <QA> Current Topic: Events
[19:22:09] <genova> Neo31: if volunteers why not add more language
[19:22:23] <R0ok__> pieter2627: English + French is good enough
[19:22:30] <klem__> how can i had lyself on the map
[19:22:34] <zabear> Kilos:  I had been looking at the AfricanTeams web but did not see that it was available in more than English - perhaps I looked at wrong place?
[19:22:46] <veddox> ongolaBoy: great! Do you have a Launchpad account to participate in https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-africa?
[19:22:48] <inetpro> anyone know of any Ubuntu related events on the continent coming up soon?
[19:22:51] <ongolaBoy> inetpro: you skip some items .. :-\
[19:22:58] <Kilos> yes the website is englklish only so far
[19:23:20] <Neo31> if we have more than enough resources of course that would be so great genova
[19:23:24] <ongolaBoy> veddox: https://launchpad.net/~manga-willy
[19:23:27] <inetpro> ongolaBoy: we're running out of time... anything in particular you want raised?
[19:23:28] <pieter2627> zabear:  the wiki has a few trans
[19:23:32] <Kilos> our maintainer and host is snowed under unti some debconf is over
[19:23:34] <Na3iL> the website there's a plugin like a button let u navigate the website with every language u want :)
[19:23:44] <ongolaBoy> inetpro: it's ok .. I will talk about it later
[19:23:58] <veddox> could we quickly discuss Launchpad?
[19:24:02] <inetpro> we can keep talking after the meeting and in the coming days
[19:24:15] <inetpro> I just want to stick to the one hour as far as possible
[19:24:30] <inetpro> for those who have hother things to do
[19:24:34] <inetpro> other*
[19:24:52] <veddox> Could somebody explain to me why the Ubuntu Africa team has joined the Moroccan team instead of the other way around?
[19:24:57] <Na3iL> Why not we do a UGJ event for the next version of Ubuntu in a specific country and we should be present
[19:25:01] <Na3iL> at least half of us
[19:25:08] <Kilos> vedothat was me
[19:25:14] <Neo31> inetpro, I have a little thing to offer :)
[19:25:24] <inetpro> Neo31: ?
[19:25:30] <Kilos> it was the only way i could get reaction from some of the teams
[19:25:39] <Kilos> feel free to remove it
[19:25:52] <veddox> kilos I think it would be better the other way around
[19:26:04] <Neo31> I would love to help with a Drupal distribution that helps new african teams get a website online easily
[19:26:14] <Kilos> veddox  you sre right
[19:26:22] <Neo31> since I do Drupal I would be more than happy to help developing a solution like that
[19:26:40] <Kilos> as i say it was the only way i could get reaction from some of the teams
[19:26:52] <Neo31> and it would make the entry level for new teams so easy, not to mention how it helps reaching more end users (marketing)
[19:26:59] <genova> Neo31: I can help fronthand & design
[19:27:14] <Neo31> perfect genova
[19:27:26] <inetpro> Neo31: sounds like a good idea to discuss with teams who have no presence yet
[19:27:32] <Neo31> I would love to get help on designing nice mockups
[19:27:37] <Na3iL> Neo31, I'll help surely if u are in Tunis
[19:28:13] <genova> for me i'm in DAkar
[19:28:19] <pieter2627> Neo31: i can also help
[19:28:22] <veddox> ok, I gotta go - thanks for the good discussion everyone!
[19:28:32] <inetpro> veddox: thanks for coming
[19:28:32] <Neo31> stick around on the mailing list and we can discuss that further :)
[19:28:36] <Kilos> ty for coming veddox
[19:28:43] - veddox offline
[19:28:45] <genova> but with a github acount thinks be eaasy too
[19:29:21] <Neo31> I also think we should all introduce ourselves on a mailing list thread
[19:29:27] <Kilos> inetpro  lets move on
[19:29:32] <Neo31> a dedicated thread
[19:29:33] <inetpro> QA: accepted discuss hosting of team websites on the mailing list with those who do not have a presence yet

[19:31:00] <R0ok__> yes
[19:31:02] <R0ok__> Kilos: is ubuntu-africa on github ?
[19:31:11] <inetpro> QA: move Miscellaneous to next meeting
[19:31:11] <QA> inetpro: Sorry...
[19:31:11] <Neo31> I think it is very important for everyone to introduce themselves in a dedicated thread on the mailing list
[19:31:12] <Kilos> nop
