[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:01:07] <johnc4510>	ok, everyone ready?  +1 please so i know who's here
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:01:11] <soldats>	+1
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:01:11] <kennymc0>	+1
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:01:11] <tyche>	+1
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:01:15] <paul928>	+1
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:01:30] <johnc4510>	hmm ok
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:01:50] <johnc4510>	I want to start off by thanking all of you for you concern regarding my Mom and her problems. She is somewhat better, but still having some problems that we are trying to work through. We are hopefull that in time she can get back to her normal activities. Until that time, I will be somewhat limited on the amount of time I can spend in channel. If this becomes a problem, I will be the first to let everyone know, and we can address it at tha
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:02:31] <tyche>	"and we can address it at tha"  Want to complete the sentence?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:02:33] <johnc4510>	i really appreciate everyones concern over the past wk or so
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:02:43] <Spreadsheet>	oh its a meeting
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:02:48] <johnc4510>	at that time
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:02:49] <kennymc0>	it's no problem
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:02:55] <johnc4510>	lol
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:02] <tyche>	We deal.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:11] <johnc4510>	Next I want to relate some news that I got this week, and that some of you may already know of. I received an email from a IT Manager here in Tucson wanting to donate a server to our team. I am suppose to call him tomorrow morning and then pick up the server around noon. Here are the specs and a link to a similar server:
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:16] 	 * tyche has 5 aces
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:23] <paul928>	john4510: this channel is SO quiet when you're away
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:34] <johnc4510>	paul928: ty
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:35] <ianmcorvidae>	ooh, another server
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:36] <ianmcorvidae>	sweet
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:59] <johnc4510>	2.4 GHz dual core xeon processor
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:59] <johnc4510>	2 gigs of memory
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:59] <johnc4510>	3 36 gig HD's
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:59] <johnc4510>	Raid control
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:03:59] <johnc4510>	Tape drive(for backup)
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:06] <johnc4510>	http://www.stikc.com/dell-poweredge-4600-rackmount-p29790.html
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:13] <johnc4510>	...
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:14] <Spreadsheet>	sounds pretty good
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:18] <ianmcorvidae>	ooh, much better than our current one
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:22] <johnc4510>	oh, it's a dandy
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:28] <kennymc0>	shiny
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:37] <johnc4510>	well it is used
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:41] <tyche>	It's a brute
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:48] <johnc4510>	that's not the real pic
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:04:55] <kennymc0>	still shiny even if it's used
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:05:28] <johnc4510>	After I get it home we will see what kind of shape it's in and then determine how to best put it into use. Going by specs alone, it should be a much superior machine than the one we are using now, and we would own it. I believe with the release of Hardy LTS that's due out in April, this would be a great time to "upgrade" and get rid of the current server we are using.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:05:52] <tyche>	Sounds good to me.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:06:07] <kennymc0>	sounds like a plan
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:06:07] <johnc4510>	..
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:06:13] <johnc4510>	I have looked into upgrading my home cox account to a business account with a static address. The cost isn't terribly restrictive. I am thinking we could do a lot more with this machine than we been able to do with the one we have. Examples would be using drupal or wordpress themes for our team website, hosting our own team blog for all to use, along with individual member blogs that we could transfer to this server for hosting, email hosti
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:06:27] <paul928>	can you get it into a datacenter?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:06:51] <johnc4510>	paul928: i don't know
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:06:51] <johnc4510>	maybe
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:06:51] <johnc4510>	i will have to look into that
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:06:52] <soldats>	that would be best
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:06:57] <johnc4510>	and i haven't been able to yet
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:07:18] <johnc4510>	but i will look into it
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:07:22] <paul928>	I doubt that you would be happy with home server performance
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:07:33] <johnc4510>	could be
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:07:46] <tyche>	paul928: I don't think it would have that much of a strain against it.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:07:49] <johnc4510>	i'm still open on what to do
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:08:16] <johnc4510>	right now i'm just throwing out ideas and i want everyone else to also
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:08:23] <tyche>	Plus putting it in a datacenter would increase the expense
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:08:50] <johnc4510>	Now...Paul has suggested a hosting service he uses, and of course we will consider that route too. He set up a test page for us to look at also. It's here: http://ubuntu-az.nfshost.com/
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:08:55] <soldats>	but it wouldnt up the cost of a business class cox account
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:09:22] <johnc4510>	upgrade to business is about 15 dollars a month
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:09:26] <soldats>	ok
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:09:28] <johnc4510>	for me
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:09:39] <tyche>	I'm willing to chip in $20 a year to help with expenses.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:10:01] <johnc4510>	we will have to see what a data center would charge us too
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:10:26] <johnc4510>	paul's option is _very_ inexpensive
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:10:34] <paul928>	Free
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:10:37] <johnc4510>	and something to look at
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:10:38] <johnc4510>	lol
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:10:41] <johnc4510>	yes
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:10:58] <tyche>	It's even possible that we could mix the 2 ideas
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:11:04] <johnc4510>	of course
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:11:09] <Spreadsheet>	yeah but i really do not believe something can be so good without a disadvantage
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:11:27] <soldats>	thats all her say Spreadsheet
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:11:31] <soldats>	here*
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:11:33] <Spreadsheet>	are there that you know of paul?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:11:37] <johnc4510>	well, with pauls, we get web site hosting free
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:11:37] <tyche>	The advantage of johnc4510 having the server is that we could learn how to setup and run servers.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:11:57] <ianmcorvidae>	I'm in favor of the server, especially given we'd be upgrading
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:15] <kennymc0>	yeah sounds good to me too
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:15] <ianmcorvidae>	that way we can continue to do things such as: the stats, tetrinet server, so forth
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:16] <johnc4510>	the other way we have the advantage of setting up a LAMP server with file hosting and email hosting etc
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:32] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:36] <ianmcorvidae>	nearlyfreespeech.net does email forwarding which works just as well in that respect
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:40] <ianmcorvidae>	but yes :)
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:44] <johnc4510>	ah
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:45] <johnc4510>	ok
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:50] <johnc4510>	i didn't know that
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:12:54] <ianmcorvidae>	we can also do more customization of our server
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:01] <kennymc0>	the learning aspect alone makes me think the server is worth it
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:10] <ianmcorvidae>	such as, for example, mod_python, which would allow us to use django
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:10] <kennymc0>	expecially since the machine itself is free
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:11] <tyche>	We're not locked into someone elses themes
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:23] <johnc4510>	if we go with me hosting thru cox here, we also get 10 free email addy's thru them
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:27] <tyche>	What is django?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:32] <ianmcorvidae>	well, nearlyfreespeech is a real host, so we can at least do anything they have physical support for
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:38] <ianmcorvidae>	are you familiar with ruby on rails?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:44] <tyche>	Nope
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:48] <ianmcorvidae>	It's basically that but for python, and much better.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:13:51] <johnc4510>	i've heard of that
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:14:12] <paul928>	ruby on rails performs poorly on nsf....no fastcgi
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:14:25] <tyche>	From what I've heard, just about ANYTHING including banging on rocks is better than ruby on rails
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:14:35] <ianmcorvidae>	django doesn't run at all because there is no mod_python on nfs :)
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:14:42] <johnc4510>	anyway we have a couple of options to think about and discuss in the next few wks
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:14:45] <ianmcorvidae>	php is worse than ruby on rails, lol
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:14:59] <ianmcorvidae>	php is of course the common-usage thing, which is terrible
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:15:03] <johnc4510>	we wouldn't be doing anything with it until the hardy LTS release
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:15:05] <ianmcorvidae>	but usually the worst option is the one in most use ;0
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:15:31] <tyche>	Are you going to wait for the full release, or start with the Beta?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:15:44] <Spreadsheet>	i think we should wait for the new release
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:15:51] <johnc4510>	i think we should wait for the final
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:15:54] <tyche>	After all, that's what a Beta is for - Testing.  Hee hee
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:16:26] <johnc4510>	once we start the server, if we do, we want it to run non stop without having to upgrade
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:16:37] <Spreadsheet>	well, gutsy gets more support
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:16:41] <johnc4510>	thoughts??
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:16:48] <soldats>	Spreadsheet: no it doesnt
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:16:49] <Spreadsheet>	i think the final
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:00] <soldats>	hardy is an LTS gusty isnt
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:10] <johnc4510>	sure, but once hardy hits, it will get most of the forum support and such
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:17] <soldats>	yep
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:22] <ianmcorvidae>	soldats: at the moment, gutsy is released and hardy is alpha, so gutsy gets more support :P
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:22] <Spreadsheet>	yeah
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:23] <johnc4510>	and we want an LTS
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:34] <johnc4510>	so the timing is good
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:35] <ianmcorvidae>	Yes, wait for the full release :)
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:38] <soldats>	ianmcorvidae: im talking about the final in the long run
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:41] <tyche>	Ok
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:17:51] <johnc4510>	final   yes
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:18:16] <paul928>	If you would like, you can alway start using the http://ubuntu-az.nfshost.com server and later I'll transfer the database to you
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:18:22] <johnc4510>	we have several advantages with servers
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:18:39] <johnc4510>	slofgren and ian have good experience on them
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:18:47] <johnc4510>	and a lot of knowledge
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:18:56] <johnc4510>	and i'm sure others of you do to
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:19:08] <ianmcorvidae>	slofgren has experience, I have time to kill reading stuff on the internet, was what you meant :P
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:19:30] <johnc4510>	one thing that concerns me is that we really haven't been using the old server very much
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:19:49] <soldats>	but this is a chance for everyone to pitch in
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:20:03] <soldats>	and learn collectively
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:20:05] <ianmcorvidae>	we haven't? Stats, webpage, so forth are all there
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:20:25] <ianmcorvidae>	Once May rolls around I'll probably start contributing a lot more, and a server would be my focus, heh
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:20:30] <soldats>	he means to its full potential i think
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:20:30] <johnc4510>	if we _are_ going to use this one as i have said, i don't want us to be laying out extra $'s every month for something we aren't putting to the best use
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:20:34] <tyche>	The old server was rather restricted, and I, for one, felt that it would be better if I didn't put a strain on it.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:20:53] <johnc4510>	tyche:  yes
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:20:56] <johnc4510>	i agree
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:21:01] <johnc4510>	it wasn't the best
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:21:07] <johnc4510>	but it was what we had
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:21:08] <johnc4510>	lol
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:21:15] <tyche>	Yep.  I agree.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:21:17] <ianmcorvidae>	Perhaps we should discuss what people would like to do with a server (that they would actually be willing to help implement)
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:21:40] <johnc4510>	ok, i think you all see what i'm saying about utilizing this if we commit
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:21:55] Join	rrbox has joined this channel (n=rr@ip68-228-44-25.tc.ph.cox.net).
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:21:59] <soldats>	i think the team blog and personla blogs would be nice as well as email
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:22:12] <johnc4510>	soldats: agreed
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:22:14] <tyche>	And forums
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:22:20] <soldats>	yea yea
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:22:23] <johnc4510>	they would get a lot of use i think
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:22:52] <johnc4510>	i think we could also use it for support for the installfests too
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:04] <kennymc0>	yeah that would be nice
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:05] <johnc4510>	and as advertising for same
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:07] <soldats>	yea
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:29] <johnc4510>	i am thinking that if we do this we should
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:37] <soldats>	+1
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:43] <ianmcorvidae>	for blogs we could probably set up wordpress-mu
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:46] <johnc4510>	have one person as a server leader   like slofgren
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:47] <ianmcorvidae>	so that's quite possible
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:54] <ianmcorvidae>	webpage stuff is certainly possible
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:54] <Spreadsheet>	yeah
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:23:55] <ianmcorvidae>	heh yeah
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:24:12] <johnc4510>	and then maybe have small groups working on different aspects of the serve
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:24:15] <johnc4510>	server
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:24:22] <johnc4510>	like say drupal
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:24:27] <johnc4510>	or email
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:24:35] <johnc4510>	or whatever
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:24:38] <johnc4510>	ten
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:24:40] <johnc4510>	then
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:25:09] <johnc4510>	maybe we have a instructional by each subteam on what they are doing
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:25:11] <Spreadsheet>	can i work on graphic?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:25:13] <johnc4510>	setup etc
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:25:13] <Spreadsheet>	s
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:25:20] <johnc4510>	thoughts?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:25:32] <tyche>	Sounds like a possibility.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:25:42] <Spreadsheet>	i think its goof
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:25:42] <soldats>	johnc4510: that could work forum based
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:25:43] <Spreadsheet>	d
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:26:14] <ianmcorvidae>	Seems like a reasonable plan, so long as there is enough interest within the group, such that we'll actually HAVE those groups
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:26:18] <soldats>	since we will have a personal forum as well we can have subsections for that
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:26:19] <johnc4510>	in that way, we could all be learning and at the same time teaching the rest of us
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:26:28] <johnc4510>	ianmcorvidae: agreed
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:26:39] <johnc4510>	soldats: k
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:27:07] <soldats>	so how i feel now is i really would like to do this but maybe we should pull a few more people into regular mettings and see if more people want to be involved
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:27:22] <johnc4510>	ok, well, we can't go to much further until i get it home and look it over and see exactly what we have
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:27:36] <johnc4510>	soldats: agreed
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:27:40] <johnc4510>	hopefully

[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:27:53] <ianmcorvidae>	in all likelihood, we can't get anything started until April, no?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:28:05] <johnc4510>	the newsletter about this meeting might draw some in to learn about servers
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:28:13] <johnc4510>	ianmcorvidae: right
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:28:28] <tyche>	I heard that, johnc4510.  I'll do my best to push it in the newsletter.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:28:31] <johnc4510>	usually releases are around the 18th of the month

[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:28:48] <soldats>	so we still have time so we should put forth effort to gain more people and more discussion later on the topic in smaller portions

[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:32:02] <soldats>	last page
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:32:48] <soldats>	i should have put it up a few days ago but i was busy
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:33:04] <kennymc0>	that's ok

[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:33:33] <tyche>	Yea, the penguin sets off the heading nicely
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:33:41] <soldats>	i think so too
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:33:54] <soldats>	personally id really like to keep it
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:10] <kennymc0>	i think it gives the flier a finished look
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:11] <paul928>	penguins are good
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:23] <kennymc0>	gives the whole thing an ending point
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:30] <tyche>	ianmcorvidae: Did you ever get with soldats about the wording you were concerned about?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:36] <Spreadsheet>	add a gnu
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:43] 	 * johnc4510 i am concern a little on "what to bring" section
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:44] <kennymc0>	if that wasnt there i could be confusing for some people and seem like there should be more if it ended with just text
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:48] <ianmcorvidae>	yeah, I posted it on the forum
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:55] <ianmcorvidae>	most of the wording on the flyer appears to be mine
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:34:58] <soldats>	tyche: its been added
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:35:22] <tyche>	Ah, good.  I hadn't heard the latest on that.  Old and slow, you know.  Hee hee
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:35:32] <ianmcorvidae>	hehe
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:35:38] 	 * johnc4510 see my last ? above please ^^
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:35:57] <ianmcorvidae>	yeah, that's missing a lot of the actual stuff on 'what to bring'
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:36:05] <johnc4510>	ok, now
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:36:06] <tyche>	Yea, we need a list of what is needed
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:36:22] <johnc4510>	the way it was before had to much stuff to bring i think
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:36:26] <johnc4510>	this way
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:36:30] <johnc4510>	has to little
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:36:31] <soldats>	shit i forgot
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:36:31] <johnc4510>	sorry
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:36:33] <soldats>	oops
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:36:40] <johnc4510>	it should include
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:37:11] <ianmcorvidae>	I figure it should be fairly specific
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:37:12] <johnc4510>	computer, keyboard, mouse, cables
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:37:23] <johnc4510>	should we have monitor?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:37:25] <tyche>	monitor?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:37:26] <ianmcorvidae>	see my post a couple up from soldats' for my suggested text
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:37:31] <ianmcorvidae>	yes, they should bring monitors
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:37:34] <soldats>	ian had the list i forgot to add it
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:37:34] <johnc4510>	looking
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:01] <soldats>	i was super busy when i did it
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:09] <paul928>	does anyone in phx or tucson own a kvm switch?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:23] <ianmcorvidae>	not I
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:29] <johnc4510>	not i
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:33] <kennymc0>	not i
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:34] <johnc4510>	now
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:39] <tyche>	Nope.  I've barely heard of them.
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:44] <ianmcorvidae>	although a good many-head kvm switch would be an easy way to do that
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:57] <ianmcorvidae>	still, having them bring monitors/keyboards/mice is probably easier
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:38:58] <johnc4510>	i'm not sure about the wireless stuff
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:39:10] <paul928>	I have a 2 port that I'm not using
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:39:25] <johnc4510>	if we start configuring wireless cards, well that's a pain
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:39:31] <ianmcorvidae>	I included the wireless cards there because those ARE a pain :)
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:39:46] <ianmcorvidae>	but typically, it's just a matter of installing the right package
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:39:55] <soldats>	if it needs to be configged we need to be there to help
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:39:59] <ianmcorvidae>	that would just be a matter of  brushing up on the wiki before we come, so forth
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:40:03] <ianmcorvidae>	yeah
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:40:23] <ianmcorvidae>	I figure we're there to help with that sort of thing that's not REALLY that complicated, but which a new user would find difficult
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:40:43] <johnc4510>	well, different cards need different drivers, some need ndswrapper, some don't etc
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:40:50] <soldats>	we at least need to give good advice on it
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:40:52] <ianmcorvidae>	exactly
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:40:53] <johnc4510>	i'm just throwing out stuff here
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:40:57] <ianmcorvidae>	but the wiki has most cards covered
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:41:14] <ianmcorvidae>	hence, we can probably do what needs doing and teach new users about the wiki at the same time
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:41:23] <soldats>	the broadcom is a pain so we should read the frums on thoise as well just in case
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:41:32] <johnc4510>	ok, everyone agree with that?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:41:40] <ianmcorvidae>	a lot of the broadcom cards work fine with the restricted drivers now, though
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:41:40] <tyche>	OK
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:41:57] <tyche>	Except my wife's
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:42:01] <ianmcorvidae>	also, just a random question: does someone by chance have access to a large number of ethernet cables or a big switch?
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:42:03] <johnc4510>	well, in tucson, i know we have ian to fall back on
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:42:04] <tyche>	That's the one that's a pain
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:42:09] <johnc4510>	what about phoenix
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:42:31] <soldats>	i might be able to get one
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:42:31] <kennymc0>	i can make some if i went out and bought the stuff
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:42:32] <johnc4510>	i'm hoping that will be provided
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:42:32] <ianmcorvidae>	because if te have a reasonable number of people we could come against some fairly interesting problems without enough cables/ports
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:43:01] <johnc4510>	ianmcorvidae: i'm working on pima right now, but i don't have a final word yet
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:43:11] <ianmcorvidae>	especially given that wireless is often very difficult to get working, we want wired connecitons
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:43:15] <ianmcorvidae>	ah, that's pretty excellent
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:43:18] <johnc4510>	i know that pima west has all the stuff we need
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:43:36] <johnc4510>	not sure of the other branches
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:43:44] <johnc4510>	nothing is final yet
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:43:55] <johnc4510>	well, you know how schools are
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:44:11] <johnc4510>	25 people to get the ok from
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:44:13] <johnc4510>	etc
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:44:23] <ianmcorvidae>	yeah, hehe
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:44:48] <johnc4510>	i also have the addy for the phoenix location to add in
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:45:16] <johnc4510>	i'll give it to tyche for the newsletter as i'm not at my desktop right now
[Sun Mar 16 2008] [21:45:24] <tyche>	OK.
