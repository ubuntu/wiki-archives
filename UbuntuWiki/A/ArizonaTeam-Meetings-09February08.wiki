[Sun Feb 8 2009] [21:21:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	and anything else we can think of
[Sun Feb 8 2009] [21:21:44] <kennymc0>	probably should have links to member's blogs that are external from the server
[Sun Feb 8 2009] [21:21:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	drupal have lots of modules(plugins) to use
[Sun Feb 8 2009] [21:22:09] <tyche>	Those members may move their blogs to the team site.

[Sun Feb 8 2009] [21:23:15] <kennymc0>	basically just have to sit down and decide what we want
[Sun Feb 8 2009] [21:23:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	the main thing is to advance at a rate we can learn at
[Sun Feb 8 2009] [21:23:30] <kennymc0>	yep
