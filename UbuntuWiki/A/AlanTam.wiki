=== About Me ===

I'm currently studying Doctor of Philosophy in <nowiki>[[http://www.cs.hku.hk|Department of Computer Science]]</nowiki> of <nowiki>[[http://www.hku.hk|The University of Hong Kong]]</nowiki>. I am one of the directors of the IT startup <nowiki>[[http://www.tnc.hk/|Team and Concepts Limited]]</nowiki> located in Hong Kong. TnC developed <nowiki>[[http://www.editgrid.com|EditGrid]]</nowiki>, a Web 2.0 Spreadsheet software for people to access, collaborate and share their spreadsheet with their colleagues, friends and the public.

I believe in freedom in software and others, but the current business world does not allow my company to live with it yet. In addition, at the moment I still cannot live without non-free software, books, music, movies, etc. I will work hard to fix <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/1|Bug 1]]</nowiki>, but not only to bring freedom to one person, to one company, to one city, or to one country, but to one world.
