=== Level of Difficulty ===

This project is for advanced users who have the time to work through issues that may develop along the way and are willing to reinstall the Mac OS and their data if problems occur during the process.

There may not be any huge issues, but the potential exists. Be prepared, have a current backup, and read through the whole process before installing Ubuntu.

=== Install ===

First, download the Ubuntu ISO image you want and prepare the bootable medium (flash drive, external hard drive etc.).

Connect or insert the bootable medium with the Ubuntu installer on it and boot the Mac

Now there are two ways to boot from the medium.

During boot (after the boot chime, if it has one), hold down the option key, it should automatically boot from the medium and run the installer (this may only work if using an optical disc, I’m not too sure)
During boot (after boot chime), hold down the Option key, the boot manager should come up (looks like the image below), there should be a CD or USB drive icon with the word “Windows” below it, click it and continue (the boot manager calls everything that isn’t macOS “Windows”), now it should boot from the medium and run the installer.

Use the Ubuntu installer to wipe, partition and format the SSD, then continue with the install.

After Ubuntu is installed, remove or unplug the install medium and reboot, the Mac should now boot directly into Ubuntu.

At this point, install the software you want to use and enjoy.
