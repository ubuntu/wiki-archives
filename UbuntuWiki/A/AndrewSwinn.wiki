== About ==

Based in Central West New South Wales, Australia, I am a Network Technician working mostly with Microsoft Windows networks.

Although I spend a lot of time working within a Microsoft environment I also have a large interest in other operating systems and in particular Ubuntu. I have a strong interest in building computer networks with multiple operating systems.
