APT is the system that Ubuntu uses to download and install programs. 

== package xxxxxxxxxxxxx failed to install/upgrade ==

Sometimes, APT thinks it has downloaded a package and then discovers it's shorter than expected or broken. This can happen when the connection to the internet is severed or by a disk fault or other problems. It's not something you should see often. Most people never see it.

The full message is usually, '''package ''packagename'' ''versionnumber'' failed to install/upgrade: cannot copy extracted data for ''filename'' to ''filename'': unexpected end of file or stream'''.

The fix is not difficult, but involves opening the ''Terminal'' program and typing

`sudo apt-get clean`

and pressing Enter. Then `exit` if it didn't complain. That will remove the incomplete file and you should then be able to try upgrading or installing again.
