=== Problem ===

Change the theme is one of the "killer-feature" of GNU/Linux desktops in front Mac0S o Microsoft Windows.
In gnome2 was very easy to change and add new ones, but in gnome 3 this thing is more hidden, difficult to find and not enjoyable.

=== Solution ===

I made some mockups for future implementation theme selector as wallpaper style in gnome setting preferences, with new icon.

=== Mockups ===

Mockup 1(new system settings option) 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <nowiki>[[File:settings.png]]</nowiki>
| <nowiki>[[attachment:settings.png|Download]]</nowiki>
|}

Mockup 2(Theme selector with small and big autogenerator previews) 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <nowiki>[[File:theme_small.jpg]]</nowiki>
| <nowiki>[[attachment:theme.png|Download]]</nowiki>
|}

=== New icon ===

With a new metaphor it will be necessary.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <nowiki>[[File:icons.png]]</nowiki>
| <nowiki>[[attachment:icons.tar|Download scalable icon set]]</nowiki>
|}
