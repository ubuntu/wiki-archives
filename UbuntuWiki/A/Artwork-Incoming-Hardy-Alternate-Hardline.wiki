== Ubuntu 8.10 Mockups ==

Here are some mockups I made. Just trying to further develop the ideas expressed and mockups made so far, in the process of developing a art concept for the upcoming Ubuntu Hardy Heron

=== Wallpaper ===
First of all, we need a wallpaper. I really like this one:
<nowiki>[[http://www.sxc.hu/photo/346151]]</nowiki>
Reasons:
* it has nice Ubunu-ish colours
* Looks dangerous and intense, yet flurry
* Gives associations to deserts, african environment etc.

=== Palette ===

=== Comments ===

* I love polar bears! Thanks - Anonymousman123 Today, during Twilight. 
* What's funny is it looks a lot like the BasicIdeals theme. -- Lmessenger  * This mockup looks fantastic, goodluck! - Hamish14
* The wallpaper is perfect !, we still need improve the GTK Theme -- MarceloAtie (2008-01-27)
* Looking pretty good, but shouldn't an animal wallpaper be more thematically tied-in? This looks too much like an Apple wallpaper. What about taking a cropped close-up of a heron wing and colorizing it? -Sumit
* Exist only two themes what i prey for to be used in 8.10 and this is one of them.
