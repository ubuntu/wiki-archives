__TOC__

I should be avila, I think I created an account multiple times. damn.

So this is the page about me, apparently. I'm educated but boring; female but not necessarily obsessed with pink; and am no programmer but play with Perl every day.

I don't like peanut butter but I will tolerate it with grape or strawberry jelly, preserves on a good day. 

I'm a handywoman which is basically a handyman with a little WOW in there.

Someday I might possibly consider maybe uploading an image of myself.
