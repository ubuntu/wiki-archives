The simple things are the best! I tried to make it as easy as possible! But at the same time to introduce modern concepts! I used a color related to ubuntu! And a graphics engine( Aurora) that allowed me more rounded!

=== Concept ===
 many gray And edges rounded, I changed the theme aurora in depth and in almost all aspects!
