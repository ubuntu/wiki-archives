=== IRC Channel guidelines ===
* No SMS speak (lo, vry1!, k, thx, hw r u?)
* No flooding the channel with long messages
* The <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> should always be obeyed
* Being nice to each other, being cooperative and respecting each other is a must
* Be Lively & Friendly
* No trolling 
* Off-topic chat is ok, but to an extent
* Personal talk should be moved to private messaging
* Telugu is allowed, but english is easily understandable to your friend
* #ubuntu-ap welcomes any help, but we do ask you to stay as helpful as possible. If you get stuck, say so instead of guessing; someone else will step up and continue. Telling people to RTFM or to "just google it" is not very polite, find them a url or at least give them some directions to documentation they can use.
* Try to complete your sentence in single enter. Don't give couple of enters for one sentence.
* If you are new to IRC, read the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-in.org/wiki/IRC_FAQ|IRC FAQ]]</nowiki>
