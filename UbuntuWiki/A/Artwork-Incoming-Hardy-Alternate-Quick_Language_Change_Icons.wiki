__TOC__

== Language Change ==

This idea would be of excellent use, making it easy to change between multiple languages easily. Having the current language in the notification bar, much like mac, where an image is displayed. This program would hopefully change and ad accents to letters in accordance to the language.

=== Concept ===
Small language flag icons in the notification bar, clicking on the flag would create a drop down menu with other language flags on it.
