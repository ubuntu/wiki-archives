21:24 < johnc4510> xHans: k
21:24 < xHans> the 25th is the Installfest at UaT
21:25 < johnc4510> k
21:25 < johnc4510> well, we could have it there, what about food and drink?
21:25 < kennymc0> do we want to have it that night after the install fest so that some plug guys can come afterwards if they want?
21:25 < xHans> deciding tonight to have it there would be good as tomorrow I will be helping them with community feedback for their accreditation review ;-)
21:26 < xHans> we would have to get food and drink from their cafe
21:26 < scott_ev> do it on the 25th
21:26 < tyche> How's their cafe stocked?
21:26 < xHans> the cafe will work with us, but we'll want to make sure they know we'll have people there
21:26 < johnc4510> xHans: what about that, we go to the installfest then we all go to peter pipers for party?
21:26 < johnc4510> i remember the cafe
21:26 < xHans> johnc4510: or head to Boulders on Broadway for a party

21:27 < tyche> I don't know how to find Boulders
21:27 < scott_ev> gim him a map
21:27 < johnc4510> it's not far from the UAT, and you could follow
21:28 < SlickMcRunfast> not far at all
21:28 < xHans> weekend hours for the cafe are 11.00 - 13.00 and 16.00 - 18.30
