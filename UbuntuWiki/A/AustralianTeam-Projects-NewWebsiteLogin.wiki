== Logging in to the new UbuntuAU Website ==

=== What has changed? ===

Upgrading to Drupal 6 has allowed us to make use of the Ubuntu Single Sign On service provided by Launchpad and integrate it into the site. This will dramatically reduce the amount of spam accounts generate on the website and make running the site easier and more efficient. 

The upside is that it means that anyone with a current account on the website will now be able to log in just pressing a button instead of having to remember yet another login for yet another website. The only downside is anyone who current has an account on the website will need to add the Launchpad OpenID login credentials to their account.

To make this migration easier we've written a step by step guide (with screen shots - I love Shutter!) to guide you the whole way through.

=== Adding OpenID to an existing account ===

=== Visit the website ===

----

=== On the right hand side of the website you will see the login section on the website. If you have an existing account you will want to select the "cancel openid login" option ===

----

=== This will open up the familiar login window where you need to put in your username and password that you previously used on the ubuntu.com|org.au website and then press the log in button. ===

----

=== Upon logging in it will present you with your user account screen from there select the "OpenID Identities" tab along the top. ===

<nowiki>[[File:UbuntuAUNewWebsiteF.png]]</nowiki>

----

=== This presents you with another screen where you need to click on the "Add a Launchpad OpenID" button ===

<nowiki>[[File:UbuntuAUNewWebsiteG.png]]</nowiki>

----

=== If you have logged into the Single Sign On facility before on this computer it will remember you and give you your login details, for example mine is shown below, all I would need to do is press the "Yes, sign me in" button. If you have any problems there is the "Login Support" button on the bottom right hand side to guide you. ===

----

=== Upon completion this will take you back to the ubuntu.org.au website and show you your user account page and state that the OpenID addition was successful ===

<nowiki>[[File:UbuntuAUNewWebsiteI.png]]</nowiki>

----

=== To test this works, log out of your account by using the logout button on the User menu on the right hand side. ===

<nowiki>[[File:UbuntuAUNewWebsiteE.png]]</nowiki>

----

=== You should now be back on the main front page. To log in now and into the future all you need to do is press the "Login" button underneath the "Ubuntu Login" heading ===

<nowiki>[[File:UbuntuAUNewWebsiteJ.png]]</nowiki>

----

=== This will take you to a familiar page and select "Yes, sign me in" ===

<nowiki>[[File:UbuntuAUNewWebsiteK.png]]</nowiki>

----

=== Tah DAH! It works! ===
