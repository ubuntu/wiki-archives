Hello, my name is Adam Warren.
I'm learning how to triage bugs, hopefully going to start making a bigger impact with the ubuntu community. 
I'm currently attending Butler University for Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering, but have considered changing to Computer Science.

Currently I have no interest in a specific area of bugs, I'm still undecided.
