== About me ==
I am currently working as a Kernel Engineer in the <nowiki>[[KernelTeam|{{https:--launchpadlibrarian.net-7080714-ubuntu-kernel-team-small.png}}]]</nowiki><nowiki>[[KernelTeam|Ubuntu Kernel Team]]</nowiki> at Canonical. I am specialized in operating systems, embedded systems, virtualization solutions and system architectures. I received the Laurea degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Siena on 2004.

I have contributed to many open-source projects, with a particular interest with the Linux kernel. As an outcome of my development efforts I have implemented the <nowiki>[[https://lwn.net/Articles/332839/|cgroup io-throttle]]</nowiki> patch set, that ultimately evolved into the blkio cgroup controller (merged into the mainline kernel), I have also experimented <nowiki>[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ariyHxpYw8E|opportunistic memory reclaim]]</nowiki> techniques to speed up hibernation in cloud computing environments and I periodically contribute with bug fixes / little improvements here and there in the Linux kernel.
