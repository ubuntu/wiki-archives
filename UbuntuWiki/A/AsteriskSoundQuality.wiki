__TOC__

Although the default install of Asterisk installs sound files in gsm format, this often results in poor sound quality (some would say awful quality). 

The wav format files are often a preferable choice and will dramatically improve the quality of the prompts which are used. These are available at the digium site:

http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/sounds/

For english prompts, you would use:

http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/sounds/asterisk-core-sounds-en-wav-current.tar.gz

http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/sounds/asterisk-extra-sounds-en-wav-current.tar.gz

After unpacking, these can be copied into the /usr/src/asterisk-sounds subdirectory, as well as removing the .gsm files.
