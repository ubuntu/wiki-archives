=== Email Clients ===
One of the most popular uses of the Internet is email. Everyone, in some manner, communicates to one or more individuals through electronic mail. While most email providers have web pages for users to use webmail, many people prefer to use email clients, which is an easier way on obtaining email.

==== Evolution ====
<nowiki>[[Evolution]]</nowiki> is the primary email client for Ubuntu, which is already installed. It comes with a Calendar, Contacts, Memo, and Tasks, along with its email services. You can also configure Evolution with an <nowiki>[[EvolutionExchange| Exchange server]]</nowiki>, as well as synchronization with <nowiki>[[NokiaEvolutionBluetoothSyncing| Nokia phones]]</nowiki>. Here are some other documents on using Evolution:

* <nowiki>[[HowToEnableSpamFilteringInEvolution| Enable Spam Filtering]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[UsingGmailWithEvolution| Configuring Gmail]]</nowiki>

There is also a <nowiki>[[http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/Introduction_to_Evolution|Screencast]]</nowiki> available on Evolution.

==== Thunderbird ====
<nowiki>[[ThunderbirdNewVersion| Thunderbird]]</nowiki> is a free email and news client that is modeled after Firefox. It contains the same features as Evolution, with the exception of mobile phone synchronization.
