This is a scratchpad of notes and documentation for the OverView presentation tool.

OverView is an application for Ubuntu written using the Quickly framework and OpenGL. The intention is to provide a large planar openGL drawing area on which the user can place text, images and perhaps other stuff like videos and 3d objects. Objects can be at any scale. After assembly the Camera position will move in a sequence from object to object zooming in and out and rotating as appropriate such that each object when displayed is the right way up and nearly fills the screen. This will allow the user to conduct a presentation of their material as the camera moves about the scene. It is similar in concept to some software as a service web based presentation tools, but as a native client it uses hardware acceleration and could do interesting things such as having objects that come in and out of the plane.
