== Basics ==
Hello, world! 

I've been an Ubuntu user since 9.10, Karmic Koala. I'm continually looking at new ways I can contribute to the open-source community, but until I've had a bit more practice with my programming, I've been happy to spend the last few years translating.
I have skills in French, German and Latin but most often simply alter americanised spellings into their british english variants and correct grammar errors, in package translations on launchpad.
* Obviously, I spend a lot of time on studying and generally living lol but I do like to keep my 'launchpad karma' high: I think at the time of writing, I'm still the highest contributor to british english translations.

{*} ON SEPTEMBER 12TH 2012, I was accepted to be an official ubuntu member. THANK YOU, EVERYONE! :D

== Launchpad's British English Translation Team ==
Since September 2011, I have headed the British English Translation Team in launchpad (https://launchpad.net/~lp-l10n-en-gb) 
and we're always looking for new members with a high proficiency in correcting spelling and grammar mistakes, before they find their way into the british english locale. Admittedly, we do tend to focus a lot on the ubuntu packages and often step in in lieu of the official ubuntu team to oversee revisions and complete translations for the userbase.
The team is extremely dedicated and it's not uncommon for us to work through 1000s of translations in a few weeks...or sooner! 

== Latin locale ==
UPDATE: 16/7/2014
The ubuntu latin team, after years of inactivity, is now underway to being restored. This team, combined with the Launchpad sister team (https://launchpad.net/~lp-l10n-la), will now be able to coordinate an effort to bring Latin to ubuntu and the 21st century!!

Latin itself is a language which is scarcely written and almost never spoken, but it remains the root of romance languages and is a great contributor to english itself. It binds together english, spanish, french and italian speakers etc and ultimately allows a large fraction of europe to speak with one tongue. 
I occasionally get the odd email from those who can write in latin, so i hope we can generate some interest in getting strings translated in the years to come.
A few particulars are left to iron out. Members might not necessarily have a language in common other than latin e.g. someone who can speak spanish and latin but not english will have difficulty if messages are displayed in english. There is also room for error, as latin is certainly not an '''easy''' language - that's what makes it so accurate - and allows you to say so much with so few words!
To sum up, It would be nice to get Ubuntu translated into latin, and I can certainly see it happening in the next few years if interest steps up a bit.  

== Plans for the (immediate?) future ==
* When i heard that users new to Ubuntu's new layout were having trouble figuring out what the available options actually did, i slipped a translation change into the update-manager package and changed it to appear as "Software Updater", so that when users clicked the cog in the corner, it would show that rather than the alternative at the time, which i thought was a bit open-to-interpretation for new users who weren't familiar with it. Glad to see the change stuck! Also the change to 'Rubbish Bin' for nautilus and beyond!

* I'm always on the lookout for any other tweaks I can throw in to improve the user experience. Everything my teams do is for the comfort of the enduser in their native language.

== Testimonials etc ==

* As a member of the en_GB translations team, Anthony has provided excellent leadership to the team and has been an example of pure dedication to the Ubuntu Project. Translation plays an important role in making Ubuntu available to all. I support his request in becoming a member. VibhavPant - Sat, 01 Sep 2012 22:38:01 +0530
* I would like to thank Anthony for his great and quick contribution to the German translation of emesene, just days before the release of emesene 2.12.9. Great job, thanks! Geoffrey De Belie (computergeoffrey) - Sat, 01 Sep 2012 20:10 (GMT+1 with summertime)
* As a member of the en_GB translations team, I would like to thank Anthony for his great leadership and dedication. Also, as the coordinator of the elementaryOS en_GB translations team, I would like to thank him for his excellent contribution and the accuracy of his translations. Alfredo Hernández (aldomann).
