=== Forest ===

Inspired by a recent trip through the Great Smokey Mountain National Forest, this theme is a calming blend of natural woodland colors.

=== Concept ===

Green is a very natural color, unlike bright blues and purples, but is also a cool/calming color, unlike oranges and reds.  It keeps with the "human" feel of the original Ubuntu color scheme, without the harsh colors that so many people find off-putting.

* Nice break/alternative from the typical brown and orange color schemes. Even if this doesn't make it as a default, I would still certainly like to see it available as an option in the additional themes in the repos. Very soothing color scheme. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:blueyonder64]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>
