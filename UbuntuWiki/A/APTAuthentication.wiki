__TOC__

The 0.6.x branch of APT contains support for cryptographically authenticating package repositories.  Packages for testing are available here: <pre>
deb http://people.ubuntulinux.org/~mvo/apt-authentication/ /
</pre>

The only remaining issue which needs to be dealt with before enabling it by default is to implement a policy for key management:

* How will keys be provided in a fresh install?
* How will keys be authenticated?
* How will new and updated keys be distributed to existing installations?
* How will key revocations be processed?

Once this has been addressed, apt 0.6.x can be uploaded to Hoary.  Once it is in place, the frontends can be modified:

* synaptic will be modified by MichaelVogt (partly done)
* aptitude will be modified by MichaelVogt or DanielBurrows
