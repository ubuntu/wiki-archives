This page describes how to do a server install of Ubuntu Lucid (10.04) on a Beagle C4 board.

==== Requirements ====
You will need an SD card, a USB disk/key (the target device you install to, if you want to install to the SD you run the installer from, use the <nowiki>[[ARM-BeagleNetInstall|NetInstall]]</nowiki> image) and a powered USB hub. 

==== Downloading the installer files ====
Get the ubuntu-10.04-server-armel+omap.img image file from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/lucid/release/

<pre>
wget http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/lucid/release/ubuntu-10.04-server-armel+omap.img
</pre>

==== Preparation work ====

Write the image file to an SD card:
<pre>
sudo dd if=/part/to/img/file of=/dev/mmcblk0
</pre>

Attach your display and a keyboard to the beagle. 

If your NAND setup is still the default that was shipped with the beagle you can just boot now. 

In case your uboot setup is not able to boot a boot.scr file anymore, use the following uboot commands in a serial console to boot from the Ubuntu SD card:

<pre>
OMAP3 beagleboard.org # mmc init
OMAP3 beagleboard.org # fatload mmc 0 0x82000000 boot.scr
...
OMAP3 beagleboard.org # source 0x82000000
</pre>

==== Installing ====
After kernel and initramfs were loaded from the SD you will be presented with a debian-installer screen on the attached DVI display. 

Just follow the installation process, at the end you will have a fully working Ubuntu server installation on your beagleboard.
