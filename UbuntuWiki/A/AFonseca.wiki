Hello my name is '''Antonio Fonseca''' and I'm a software developer and system administrator here in (Belem-PA) Brazil. 

'''Why Ubuntu?'''

Because in my humble opinion it's one of the best and most consistent Linux distributions around. Ubuntu is powerful, secure and user friendly at the same time, it has an excellent set of resources and a great user base.
