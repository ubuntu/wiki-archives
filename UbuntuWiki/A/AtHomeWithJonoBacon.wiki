__TOC__

This page is a place to collect items that you would like Jono Bacon, the Ubuntu Community Manager, in his live weekly ustream.tv videocast that happens every wednesdat at 11am Pacific / 2pm Eastern / 6pm UTC.

Feel free to add content you would like to see on this page. Please consider the following guidelines:

* It is recommended that you ask for general best practice topics and skills growth topics that are of general interest to the community (e.g. bug triage).
* Jono regularly has a Q+A in each session, so if you have specific question, that may be the best place to ask for very specific things.
