Name: ZevenBlue

Author: Leszek Lesner

Version: 1.0 

Comment: based on the ZevenOS GTK-Theme and the Plastique Metacity Theme 

Licensed under Creative Commons 3.0

=== Concept ===

'''Objectives'''

'''*''' modern and clean

'''*''' not too dark and not too many fancy colors

'''*''' comatibly with openoffice,firefox and evolution

'''*''' default two-panel configuration of GNOME.

'''*''' It's visually neutral. Grey is a good color for this purpose

So this are the main points of the ZevenBlue Theme.

=== Desktop ===

Heres a concept of the Desktop

The greyish look of the panels does not take away the focus. the focus remains on the blueish desktop and the icons on it.

=== Metacity ===

<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Karmic/ZevenBlue?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ZevenBlue-2.png|<nowiki>[[File:ZevenBlue-2-thumb.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

Here its the same like with the panels. Keep it simple. Round borders and buttons that show their function when hovering over them (i.e. close button shows a red x)

=== GTK Theme ===
The GTK-Theme still needs some work but it should focus on a blue menuitem background when hovering and a font switching from the normal black background to white. 
The menus should have 'round corners' at the bottom. Menuitems that are selected are overlayed with a nice blue gradient. 

The Buttons need a clear round border (black) and a color gradient showing if they are pressed or not. 

The progressbar should be a blue one with the same colors as the menuitems. It should have a plastic like effect. So it is necessary to keep it flat. 

Examples:
            Menuitems :

            Buttons :

            Tabs :
