=== Screen-Reader Tests ===

Most of the content on this page was taken from <nowiki>[[http://library.gnome.org/devel/accessibility-devel-guide/nightly/id2599257.html.en | Gnome Testing]]</nowiki>.

These tests are used to test any screen-reader, but may also be used to test any application. They involve using a screen-reader to read the page audibly, so a sound card and speakers or headphones are required.

==== Graphical Elements ====

Test the application using a screen reader and confirm that:
* Labels and text are being read correctly, including menus and toolbars.
* Object information is read correctly. 

==== Keyboard and Mouse ====

* Confirm that all keyboard commands are audible.
* Confirm that correct information is heard when navigating with the mouse. Clicking with the mouse and navigating with the keyboard should result in the same command/text heard.

==== Text only ====

* Confirm that text is read correctly. 
* Confirm that all text-only or read-only areas be read by the screen-reader.
** Are any special keys required to allow the text to be read?
