 04:23 <stephenm> :p

 04:23 <toddc> I should be available online

 04:24 <collie> not I....I will be out of town, as well

 04:24 <toddc> moving on

 04:24 <toddc> We are discussing a change in the way we vote.

 04:25 <toddc> Currently IRC voting can allow someone to to use multiple nicks or friends and or family to vote. We are discussing changing it those with a

 04:25 <toddc> Launch Pad account and a Code of conduct

 04:25 <toddc> Most of us have done this so there should be little to no changes and we will be happy to assit anyone with this.

 04:26 <toddc> So far there have been no objections and all in favor of this change we will vote next week

 04:26 <toddc> any comments?

 04:26 <toddc> Ideas?

 04:26 <toddc> MajB has written a activity reporting procedure with the end goal of  filing our monthley report

 04:27 <toddc> that

 04:27 <toddc> we have not been doing. So after each event/meeting we mail event,date attendees and activity to

 04:27 <MajB> To vote you must have a launchpad account, be a member of AZLOCO, and have signed the Ubuntu code of conduct

 04:27 <wmack> Just to clarify - voting on azloco business would be done on launchpad, and those in the azloco launchpad group are eligible..

 04:27 <toddc> MajB: correct

 04:28 <toddc> voting could be done here but we would need to verify each vote on LP

 04:29 <toddc> then thesreports@azloco.come can be included in our monthley report to the ubuntu community.

 04:29 * wmack applauds MajB

 04:29 <toddc> http://www.azloco.org/node/208 is a rough draft

 04:29 <wmack> Thanks MajB!
