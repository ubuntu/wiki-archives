__TOC__


Below are a few screenshots of the current look of the Peace theme.  It's nice to look at but built for speed.

=== Peace GDM theme ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:login2.png]]</nowiki>
Deep red tones and a face chooser

=== Splash Screen ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:screenshot-splash.png]]</nowiki>
A sunken splash, just inserted for kicks and grins.

=== Theme Manager ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:theme2.png]]</nowiki>
This is the new theme preview window.

=== Evolution ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:evo2.png]]</nowiki>
Evolution with the Peace icons and a new mail message open.

=== Nautilus ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:nautilus2.png]]</nowiki>
Simple veiw of Nautilus

=== Terminal ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:terminal.png]]</nowiki>
The terminal came out looking very appealing.

=== Mixing with Human ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:edgy-peace.png]]</nowiki>
Until system wide themes are implemented, Gnome meta-themes must work well with the default wallpaper and splash screens.  This is how Peace looks with Human.

=== Logout screen ===
