=== Feisty test GDM ===

It seems that no one has created a feisty test GDM theme so I have created one! I have based it on 
a orangey look for the next release! Thanks to all. Well Im David 774.

* I think it looks really great, and it fits to feisty! (Slyon)
* Very nice -- ÉtienneBersac  * Why did someone create a exact page like my original? original page:Fiesty test GDM (david)
* Think this is gone way too far, too much orange here (lahansen)
* I agree that orange is beginning to dominate the colour schemes.  This example included. (thayerw)
