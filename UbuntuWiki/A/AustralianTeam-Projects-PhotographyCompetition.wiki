== Photography Competition ==

'''Please note, this is not a confirmed competition. At this stage, it is just an idea. Please DO NOT SEND SUBMISSIONS YET'''

=== What is this about? ===

You may, or may not have, heard about the distribution of <nowiki>[[http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=02/03/09/1727250|Linux]]</nowiki> known as <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com|Ubuntu]]</nowiki>. Within the Ubuntu comunity, there are various Local Community Teams (LoCoTeams) including one for Australia.

The Australian Ubuntu LoCoTeam is seeking contributions for use in a wallpaper package for use mainly in the Ubuntu distribution. The resulting wallpapers will be usable under any Operating System, but will be branded with the photographer's information (name and URL) and the abbreviated name of the Australian Ubuntu LoCo Team, which is '''Ubuntu-Au'''.

Here is an ''example'' of the attribution:

<nowiki>[[File:hillside.jpg]]</nowiki>

Please note: Do not do the attribution directly on the photograph, yourself. This will be done at a later stage for the sake of continuity through the series.

Attribute yourself either:
* In the meta of the digital image
* In a text file contained on the CD
* On a piece of paper sent with the submission, or
* With an archive quality, soft-tipped pen on the back of the print/s

=== Prizes ===

As yet undecided. It will not be anything major though.
