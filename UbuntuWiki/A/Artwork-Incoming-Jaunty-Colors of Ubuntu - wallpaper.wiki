=== Comments ===

* Thank you very much for this amazing work, I personally use the dark version as my default background (with the Dust theme) and, well, it's just perfect ! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:Malaria]]</nowiki>
* Realy nice work. I like the dark one but I choose the light one with my "Darklooks" theme for a better contrast. Thanks. -- Bobinours
