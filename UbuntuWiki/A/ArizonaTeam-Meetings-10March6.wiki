Mar 06 21:27:30 kennymc0 might have to. checking now to see who else has admin access to it
Mar 06 21:28:32 kennymc0 yep he's the only one other than the person that created it, whom i have never talked to or met before and wouldnt know how to contact him
Mar 06 21:28:43 toddc scott_ev and talked about keeping 4 active admins so this does not happen
Mar 06 21:29:13 toddc scott and I
Mar 06 21:29:30 kennymc0 before john had to back away he was starting to do that, but i guess he hadnt gotten to the launchpad site
Mar 06 21:30:38 kennymc0 i think craig might have had admin access but he left a while back
Mar 06 21:31:03 toddc we also thought about contacting conical about it but I may wait and email john about the installfest and see if I can talk to him there
