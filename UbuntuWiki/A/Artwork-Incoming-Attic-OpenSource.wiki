Perhaps a new wallpaper for Ubuntu

== Open Source - Open Minds - Open Future ==
I'm still very inexperienced in creating wallpapers and contributing, but it's worth to try. The idea for this slogan comes from a user of ubuntuusers.de and I now tried to do some good artwork with it. It's a bit transparent, so you can change the appearance with changing GNOME's background color. Perhaps it will find an own place in Ubuntu ;)
