Though this theme can be a bit distracting with the matching background, It keeps with the earth tone feel of Ubuntu, yet makes it more eye catching
 
=== Concept ===

A big part of this theme is making the Applications, Places, Systems, desktops, etc. buttons stand out.  Using the design itself would not be necessary to the aspect of it. The Photoshoped pictures are not high enough resolution to be able to show the buttons, so I have a sketch of them.
