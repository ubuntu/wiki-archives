== Arena (v2.75) ==

A sane default theme with a smooth pallete of colors for a pleasant experience in linux.

=== Concept ===

A theme that uses some specific ubuntu old theme concepts (orange pallete, metacity ..) but makes a change to a complete clearlooks engine. The purpose is use a theme standard, easy for the eyes and fast. It uses the standard GNOME visual look: No excesive pixmap painted widgets, all from engine and all coherent.

Engine tweaks:

- Uses orange for the selected color and  sand color for the rest.

- Buttons are contrasted and more shiny that the background.

- Menu is background color  and creates continuity with the rest of the window.

- Toolbar and the notebook are more shiny that background and create sensation of volume.

- Panel has a gradient effect and resizable up to 48px.

- Metacity is original and based on clearlooks code.

- The fonts use a dark color but not totally black.

Is compatible with any size of font but I recommend sans 10 for metacity and sans 8 for the rest.

For my taste, metacity transparencies makes the theme look bad. All other composite effects looks perfect.

=== Comments ===
* Too soft, hard to read the title bar.-- Brettalton  * It's true, the new version is more sharp -- dw
* I fail to see what is new in this. Looks like Hardy pretty much, and too much (IMHO). -- Karoliina Salminen <<DateTime>>
