== Fresh theme for Hardy ==

==== Concept ====
I'd like to get the ball rolling for a new theme for Hardy.

The new clearlooks theme is great.  It has gradients on the menubar and toolbars.  In trying to keep the theme light and quick I'm using that and the smooth engine to create this theme.  Only one pixmap is being used for the panel background.  Maybe we could update the Ubuntulooks engine to pull the best of these two engines together.

Clearlooks is the default for most widgets.

Items using Smooth:
Buttons
PanelButtons
Scrollbars
Menuhighlight.

Metacity is a slightly altered human.  The buttons are larger and adjacent to each other.

Below is the work in progress theme.

=== Comments ===

* Nice ''but'' some parts are too squarish in contrast with the rest of the theme which is rounded. --DrSilly  10/6/07
* I like it. It's simple, light, easy on the eyes, and still looks modern. Great job!
