__TOC__

== Concept Art ==

This is a place to put concept art.

=== Tips ===

* Be mindful that widescreen displays are much in use now, as well as higher resolutions.
* Make sure that your images aren't too busy
** Wallpapers: people need a place to put their icons! Make sure that at least the top left is clear to place things. ### Perhaps all four corners ?
* Use a representative thumbnail, no taller than 240 pixels, with a link to the larger piece, to keep the page tidy.
** Your message and composition should still be clear in the thumbnail. If it isn't, it's time to rework your artwork.
** Use <code> attachment:thumbnail.png and [attachment:file.png linkname] </code>
* Keep things constructive
* Each new concept should stay under its own heading, like so <code>=== Concept 1 ===</code>

==== Blobs ====

This is my attempt at smooth shapes created using the "human" colors. I've avoided any sort of branding, and any bezier curves, shwoops, auroras etc. I made it using Paint.NET (something like "GIMP-Elements" for Windows). Unfortunately, I sized it at 1280x800 (my screen's rez), and exported it as a jpg; forgetting to keep the pdn file that has all the "steps" stored in it. If people like this thing, I hope someone with more skillz will make an svg, large png etc. I also submitted this in Incoming/GutsyIdeas.

I personally loved this stuff the most: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Animals

I'm a wiki noob, so I don't know how to use the internal link system or how to make thumbnails appear here.

==== Glossy ====

I would love to see this kind of fresh and modern wallpaper in Ubuntu (only maybe with smaller logo) http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Glossy+Ubuntu+wallpaper?content=66593

==== Animals ====

A concept I had. I figure someone is going to do the feather texture soon (a la "elephant" and "lion") so I tried something else. I know the colors are wrong, and the branding may be much, but it was an idea I had. My attempt at an orange/brown sky had little success. Maybe someone else can make it work? I originally had the "flare" set so that I could only see the Ubuntu logos clearly when I tilted my laptop screen a certain way, as I'm of an anti-branding bent and prefer things subtle. I also hope my Heron doesn't look too much like a goose.

You figured right! Animal skins were so popular for Gutsy, that I figured it would be a shame not to console those who really wanted them as default. Animal skins are so groundbreaking, that they are a perfect match for such a defining release. I'm not really an artist, so I'm hoping someone can take my concept and make it actually acceptable. Below, I have included a package containing more feathers and mockups (without logos); use them at will.  - <nowiki>[[Nanley_Chery]]</nowiki>

==== Stand Tall Hardy Heron ====

I´m submitting content for Ubuntu for the first time and i must say, it´s a great feeling.
The wallpaper style has been widely used on Ubuntu, but i wanted to add some words that would reflect what we all 'ubuntu-ers' feel when we talk about this amazing OS.
Hopefully this new version will even get more people on the world of Ubuntu.
Thanks for viewing!

Please edit if something´s wrong with how i edited this entry.
