[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:00:59] <scott_ev>	welcom
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:01:06] <scott_ev>	I believe most of you know that I am only moderating meetings on a temporary basis:  I am not the team leader.  Our team leader, johnc4510, is taking some time off from moderating our meetings.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:01:08] Join	Flakeparadigm has joined this channel (n=tann@c-98-225-121-106.hsd1.az.comcast.net).
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:01:13] <calimer>	howdy
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:01:18] <Flakeparadigm>	here!
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:01:24] <scott_ev>	 He is still around handling other aspects of running our LoCo and generally taking care of things that don't require a public presence.  In time, this should change and we'll again be rewarded with the opportunity to interract with him.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:01:40] <scott_ev>	 Until then we'll just have to see what we can do to keep this team active and on track.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:01:52] <scott_ev>	Feel free, at any time during the meeting, to ask questions, make productive comments or observations: we want your input.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:02:17] <scott_ev>	Before we get started with the rest of the meeting, I'd like to introduce calimer.  He's a long standing member of this team that we don't get to see ofter.  Calimer has been living and working in New York for awhile.  He's here tonight to ask us to give his project some support.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:02:24] <scott_ev>	They have really been getting some recognition in the gaming industry.  Calimer, tell us a little about you, your project, and how we can help support it.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:02:41] <calimer>	okay if you don't mind me pasting the blurb
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:02:45] <calimer>	and thanks for the intro :D
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:02:55] <scott_ev>	that's perfect
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:02:59] <calimer>	I'm happy to be a part of this team and also ableconf
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:03:07] <calimer>	and to meet some great folks
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:03:14] <calimer>	Platinum Arts Sandbox Free 3D Game Maker is an open source game design program for kids and adults.  Through the ingame and cooperative editing and focus on ease of use the program is easy enough for kids to use but powerful enough for full game projects.  Sandbox includes Save The Princess Gameplay, an RPG Maker, a Sidescoller maker, a Movie Maker aka Machinima, Save The Banana Base Capture, and more!  Sandbox is already bein
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:03:14] <calimer>	g used in many schools and colleges throughout the world and included in game design contests.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:03:34] <calimer>	I originally started the project for my K-5 before and afterschool kids
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:03:50] <calimer>	because I wanted some way for them to express their imaginations and create stories beyond just 2D stuff
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:04:21] <calimer>	then I decided to release it online so other people and kids could enjoy it
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:04:32] <calimer>	and a few years later it is up for best indie game of the year
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:05:05] <calimer>	unfortunately it is a popularity contest and not a quality contest, but if you have a few minutes and would like to throw a vote our way it would be much appreciated
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:05:07] <calimer>	http://www.moddb.com/games/platinum-arts-sandbox
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:05:29] <calimer>	the instructions are towards the top, sorry the process is kind of annoying
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:05:52] <calimer>	also I'm really excited that tyche is a part of our community
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:05:58] <calimer>	and he will soon have some of his content in Sandbox
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:06:03] <tyche>	BTW, if you want to see what can be done by an "amateur", see: http://tinyurl.com/yl72f8o
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:06:40] <tyche>	many of the textures used in that map were created by me.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:06:58] <calimer>	here is another nice picture
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:06:58] <tyche>	Including the Arizona desert rock

[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:07:10] <scott_ev>	see, this loco team is more than just wasting time on IRC....
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:07:29] <calimer>	any friends you can tell, posts on facebook and wherever else are really helpful too
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:07:34] <calimer>	every little bit helps
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:07:37] <tyche>	calimer: you should say that the Ship was done by Eagle
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:07:48] <calimer>	that ship was done by eagle, haha
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:08:21] <scott_ev>	excellent, you have my support and hopefully others will help too
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:08:28] <scott_ev>	anything else calimer?>
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:08:37] <calimer>	the project has been kind of tough to get out there because people run away when they see the kids part
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:08:41] <calimer>	but it really is for everyone
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:08:49] <scott_ev>	nice
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:08:51] <calimer>	and that is why winning the contest is important to us
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:08:57] <calimer>	because of the cred
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:09:12] <calimer>	we'll give away most of the prizes because we don't nee cds on modding halflife 2 haha
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:09:24] <calimer>	also the competition is out of 12 thousand or so projects
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:09:32] <calimer>	and we're in the final top 100 round
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:10:06] <calimer>	I think I'm about set, hehe
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:10:15] <calimer>	don't want to take up too much meeting time, but here is the link again
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:10:16] <calimer>	http://www.moddb.com/games/platinum-arts-sandbox
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:10:46] <scott_ev>	outstanding, thanks
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:11:01] <calimer>	thanks for your time and support
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:11:04] <scott_ev>	Ever wonder why we have LoCo teams? My opinion is that one of our main functions is to promote the use of an OS that allows people to be freed from confines of the closed, unstable, inflexible, expensive, Operating Systems that they may think they are stuck with - and we want to have fun doing it.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:11:17] <scott_ev>	So we get together on IRC and set up Installfests, Release Parties, etc.  Here's part of what Ubuntu has to say:
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:11:21] <calimer>	that reminds me of a funny little story
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:11:23] Join	toddnb has joined this channel (n=chatzill@67-60-15-0.cpe.cableone.net).
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:11:34] <calimer>	this guy was telling his friend about sandbox
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:11:49] <calimer>	and the dude went on a tirade about why doesn't it work for linux and no one makes anything for linux
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:11:53] <calimer>	and we were like uh, it works on linux
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:12:08] <calimer>	so yeah, we love linux :D
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:12:14] <calimer>	a bunch of our devs are linux only users
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:12:29] <scott_ev>	Ever since the birth of computers, enthusiasts and fans around the world have collected together in garages, universities and pubs to talk about their interest, learn from each other and help promote their interest. Combine this with the huge popularity of Ubuntu, and you have the Ubuntu LoCo project.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:12:45] <scott_ev>	With the incredible success of Ubuntu around the world, the LoCo project is here to help groups of Ubuntu fans and enthusiasts work together in regional teams to help advocate, promote, translate, develop and otherwise improve Ubuntu. Our worldwide network of LoCo teams is providing a strong backbone to our already vast and extensive Ubuntu community.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:12:56] <scott_ev>	Ubuntu 10.4 Lucid Lynx Alpha 2 Released

[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:13:23] <Flakeparadigm>	And is working great!
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:13:26] <scott_ev>	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/edubuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-2/ (Edubuntu)
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:13:36] <scott_ev>	Alpha 2 includes a number of software updates that are ready for wider testing. Please refer to http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/alpha2 for information on changes in Ubuntu.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:13:47] <Flakeparadigm>	Nvidia drivers are all fixed up and the Gnome notifications no longer report their urgency.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:13:49] <scott_ev>	flakeparadigm and I have been working on getting it installed and running properly.  Flake, do you have a report for us?
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:14:00] <Flakeparadigm>	Nvidia drivers are all fixed up and the Gnome notifications no longer report their urgency.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:14:15] <Flakeparadigm>	However I personally had one problem with Nvidia:
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:15:16] <Flakeparadigm>	The nvidia-settings (yes, it was running as root) wouldn't save an xconfig file anywhere. If you have this problem, just click "Show Preview" on the save dialouge box and copy the contents of that and save it to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:15:41] <syn-ack>	Thank god for Intel. :P
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:16:16] <scott_ev>	I'll be reinstalling tonighjt

[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:16:36] <scott_ev>	Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 2 Removes HAL
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:16:37] <scott_ev>	http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Online/News/Ubuntu-10.04-Alpha-2-Removes-HAL
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:16:55] <scott_ev>	There will be a 10.04 Lucid Lynx release party at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe (http://www.bouldersonbroadway.net/) on the 24th of April. Boulders on Broadway has a room upstairs that we will have all to ourselves.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:17:05] <scott_ev>	We'll have wifi access too.  It's going to be a good chance to eat some good grub, have a few drinks or brewski's and meet some of the other UbuGeeks that you have only met online.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:17:16] <scott_ev>	You're not going to want to miss this.  Ok, that brings up another point:  We need volunteers for a couple of things:  we'll need a few extension cords and power strips.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:17:27] <scott_ev>	Who's planning on attending that can help out with that?
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:17:57] <scott_ev>	anyone know if they're commin?
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:18:01] <bitflip_>	I'll be there ... I can bring a power strip or 2
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:18:05] <LuftHans>	Ubuntu's HAL?
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:18:06] <scott_ev>	nice
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:18:16] <scott_ev>	Someone can pick out new features in 10.04 and present them or concentrate on one for example.  Anything to do with Ubuntu will be OK.  Things like how to navigate Launchpad and report bugs...
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:18:23] <LuftHans>	who created the HAL?
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:18:25] <syn-ack>	If you dont mind a quick intteruption... I've been running Lucid since the toolchain drop due to what I've been doing with the project and I have to say that Alpha 2 is starting shape up quite nicely... and I thank god every day that HAL has finally been removed.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:18:32] <[R]>	HAL is a freedesktop project
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:19:18] <scott_ev>	Actually, if you have a favorite piece of software that you use you can present that even if it's not in Ubuntu's repos.  Please be thinking about this.  It will only make the Release Party more of a success
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:19:33] <syn-ack>	heh
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:19:46] <scott_ev>	Here is a link to the Lucid Lynx planning page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/LucidLynx  Feel free to add to the ideas section or fill in anything that might be missing.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:19:59] <scott_ev>	We will be heading there from the monthly installfest at UAT. http://tinyurl.com/yemru26 If you've never been to an installfest at UAT, you may want to consider checking it out.  Our LoCo co-sponsors it with PLUG but we are poorly represented.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:20:13] <scott_ev>	It's a chance to help another linux user or, better yet, possibly install Linux an a computer that currently is running that other OS.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:20:13] <syn-ack>	and re the Party... I'm sorry to say that I'm not going to be able to attend since I'm in Tucson and will be working.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:20:16] <scott_ev>	http://azloco.com/node/120
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:20:27] <scott_ev>	too bad
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:20:36] <scott_ev>	you can set up one down there
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:20:48] <bitflip_>	I wouldn't mind doing some video encoding programs. I don't have enough material for a full presentation, but could pretty easily demo handbrake, makemkv, etc ...
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:20:52] <scott_ev>	use that page I gave you
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:21:10] <scott_ev>	bitflip_: get with me after the meeting, ok
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:21:17] <bitflip_>	sure
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:21:21] <scott_ev>	nice
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:21:51] Quit	[R] has left this server ("Leaving").
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:21:52] <scott_ev>	I think Flakeparadigm will be doing something that will have to br presented without him
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:21:59] <scott_ev>	he can't mnake it either
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:22:08] <scott_ev>	It's a chance to help another linux user or, better yet, possibly install Linux an a computer that currently is running that other OS.

[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:22:43] <scott_ev>	the planning page can be edited by anyonie with a LP login, si feel free to volunteer there, etc
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:22:45] <Flakeparadigm>	I'm definitly hoping to get something.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:22:50] <Flakeparadigm>	to make something**
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:22:53] <scott_ev>	I monitor it pretty rugularaly
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:23:31] <scott_ev>	It's a way off, but we're about to make fliers to be handed out at PLUG meetings ,
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:23:35] <scott_ev>	red7, etcv
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:23:47] <scott_ev>	I finally made contact with a friend in Tucson that has the contacts we need for planning future Installfests at the University.  He will be getting me in contact with the people on campus in the CS department that we coordinated with last time.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:24:00] <scott_ev>	So, it's time to start thinking about how we want to organize this event.  I'll need feedback from those of you that attended last time.  And I'm open to input.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:24:12] <scott_ev>	We'll need to do alot of planning so we can put on a good show for all attendees.  Remember that the University called it a Windows Removal Event.  That's because the CS dept has migrated to Ubuntu Linux!
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:24:23] <scott_ev>	Id imagine they are wondering where we've been since they wanted us to schedule regular installfests.  This would be a great opportunity to promote Ubuntu Linux to students and the general public in Tucson.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:24:29] <Flakeparadigm>	That would be very convienient.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:24:35] <br24>	sorry Im here
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:24:41] <scott_ev>	welcome
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:24:50] <scott_ev>	it's gonna be big..
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:24:55] <scott_ev>	We'll need fliers, etc. etc. We'll need volunteers for a variety of duties so please please spread the word in channel and via email that we are calling for help.
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:25:05] <scott_ev>	If no one else steps up and offers to be the main contact point and organizer I'll do it.  Is there anyone livint in Tucson that will volunteer to be the person to make face to face contact with our contacts on campus?
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:25:24] <syn-ack>	hrm
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:25:29] <scott_ev>	I can drive down there fot thais, but if someone will be the face, it would save me money
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:25:49] <syn-ack>	lemme think about it scot... Starting a new job for CPS so I'm not going to have quite as much time
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:26:06] <syn-ack>	(Need something full time till I can get on with my venture)
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:26:16] <scott_ev>	understood
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:26:41] <scott_ev>	I'll be setting a date pretty soon since I have made contact woth the p[eople down there
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:26:50] <scott_ev>	Also, I need someone to compose an email and mass mail everyone in our mailing list an announcement about this and the upcomming Release Party.  Anyone that's willing to do this this week? tyche do you have the mailing list or can you get me a link to where it is?
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:27:10] <tyche>	Standby
[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:27:12] <scott_ev>	Be thinking about it and we'll revisit the issue next week.

[Sunday 17 January 2010] [21:28:34] <scott_ev>	I'm proud to announce an Ubucon at SCaLE8X on Friday, February 19th, 2010.
