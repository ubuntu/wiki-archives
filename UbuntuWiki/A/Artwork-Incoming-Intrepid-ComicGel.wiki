An idea I got after looking at the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Hardy/Alternate/gelatin|Gelatin theme]]</nowiki>. I'm not saying it should be the default theme or anything, I just think it would be a good theme to have on the disc.

=== Download ===
Now available for download <nowiki>[[http://www.divshare.com/download/4421291-d58|here]]</nowiki>. 5.5 MB zip file, with instructions on installing enclosed. Works perfect on Hardy.

=== Concept ===
It is a theme based off of the Gelatin controls and window border, the HumanElephant Savane icon theme, and the ComicCursor White cursor.

=== Comments ===

* Finally, a complete theme! Good work. I like your color choices and the combinations used, but I think that a few more original elements couldn't hurt. -- PitrTMayhew  * Too much orange on the one (its too bright) and not enough contrast on the other (too dark).-- Brettalton  * -whistles- by far the best theme i've seen! very clear, light and distinct. well done! -- KhaaL
