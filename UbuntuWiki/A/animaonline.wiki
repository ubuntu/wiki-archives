__TOC__

I was born on October 23rd in the city of Murmansk, Russia
I and my family moved to Norway when I was a little kid.
I got early interested in computers; actually, everything about computers fascinated me; hardware, software, etc.
My first programming language was QBasic running on my old Win3.1 machine
Now I use C# C/C++ for my programming needs, I mostly focus on .NET Framework development as it interests me most of all, and I use it for work purposes.
In my opinion the .NET Framework has a great future.
The only major issue that it faces is the portability possibilities (I use Mono)
In my spare time, I’m interested in programming of compilers, virtual machines, hardware virtualization/automation software, as well as networking server/client applications, Application Programming Interfaces, and simple programs that make user’s life easier.
Most of my projects are open sourced.
I believe in Open-Source but I also believe that people have to eat to live and you honestly don't need (or even want) EVERYTHING to be open-source.
In my opinion interoperability may be a better solution and the key to international business!
