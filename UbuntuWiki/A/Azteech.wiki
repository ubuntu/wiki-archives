=== About Me ===
First Name: Stevan

I am 51, a divorced father of two, and grandfather to five grand-children. I am a native of Tucson, but was raised in Southeastern Washington State. I returned to Tucson in 1999 and currently work for a local distribution company. 

I spent 22 1/2 years in the U.S. Army and retired in 1997. Throughout my military career I gained an invaluable and extensive background in installing, testing/troubleshooting, and inspecting Military and Government communications networks and systems (telephone and computer) and telecommunications facilities (test centers, microwave radio and satellite). Since retiring I have worked as a Network Operations Center Manager for a major Internet backbone provider in Maryland, an installation/troubleshooting/support supervisor for a commercial communications design and installation firm in Virginia, a Telecommunications Center Manager for a major Military Telecommunications contractor in Sunnyvale, CA, and dabbled in other miscellaneous endeavors, including some independent web designing.

I am an active member of the <nowiki>[[ArizonaTeam|Ubuntu-Arizona LoCo]]</nowiki> team, and the <nowiki>[[ArizonaTeam-Teams-Membership|Ubuntu-Arizona Membership]]</nowiki> sub-team. Using computers has become a 20+ years hobby of mine.  Over the years I have built and repaired computers for friends and associates, as well as myself. I have been an on again/off again *nix user for over 20 years (mostly Unix during my military days). I have been learning and using Ubuntu Linux since Warty Warthog (October 2004), and never looked back. I currently am running Edgy Eft (version 6.10). Ubuntu Linux has been the most stable, and usable desktop operating system I have found to date.

In my spare time I enjoy various activities including (but not limited to) traveling, camping, hiking, bowling, tinkering with computers (troubleshooting/upgrading), a little computer gaming, listening to music, and watching the History channel. I am an avid outdoor sportsman, both fishing and hunting.

Like many, I have my system set up for dual booting of Ubuntu Linux and another legacy operating system. I have it setup for dual boot because there is one type of software which I run once a year that I just do not trust to have done online, and couple of games which I periodically run. I will attempt to get them to run in wine, now that wine is loaded :)
