[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:07:52] <toddc>	my finger hurt!
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:08:08] <toddc>	some new ideas about installfest...
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:08:10] <toddc>	It has been noted that not many people have been making it to out installfests looking for help.  This is, perhaps, because there's no real advertising.  So a few of us got together and discussed options.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:08:11] <toddc>	What we came up with is adding another installfest at the Tempe Escalante Community Center on a trial (3 months) basis.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:08:33] <toddc>	This way The City of Tempe offers us 3 ways to get the word out:  via their newsletter that goes to every resident of Tempe, by adding us to the bulletTODDin board on channel 11, and by adding us to the website for the city.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:08:50] <toddc>	We can get more advertising by putting fliers up at other city locations like schools, libraries, community centers, and other city facilities.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:09:09] <toddc>	We went ahead and made arrangements because we were trying to get into the newsletter.  The manager of the Escalante Center thought we could get into it this quarter but he was wrong.  It's not a huge commitment so we went for it without team approval.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:09:19] <toddc>	Please also not that this is a co-operative effort between PLUG and the AZ Loco and every effort is being made to keep it that way.  We want everyone to be informed and have an opportunity to add their input.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:09:33] <toddc>	So the schedule for installfests will be as follows for the next few months:  Feb 27th - UAT, Mar 20 - Escalante, Mar 27 - UAT, April 10 Escalante, April 24 - UAT, April 24 - Licid Release Party - Boulders, May 8 - Escalante, May 22 - UAT

[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:09:46] <toddc>	http://www.azloco.com/node/128
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:09:56] <toddc>	We are testing a standerized install for ubuntu that should help new users install a complete system start to finish if anyone would like a
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:09:58] <toddc>	copy to test and give me feed back please email me at toddc@azloco.com
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:10:20] <toddc>	we also are making new check in sheets for the installfests that we can use if they get real busy that should help speed installs
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:10:21] <toddc>	sheet 1 is a sign in and to find out what they are ther to do IE learn or install
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:10:35] <toddc>	#2 has them fill in machine info and what type of install dual boot or type of install IE vm,vb multi os
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:10:36] <toddc>	We trying to make the installs faster and easier for every one and more fun so come and join the fun
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:10:47] <toddc>	here will be a 10.04 Lucid Lynx release party at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe (http://www.bouldersonbroadway.net/) on the 24th of April. Boulders on Broadway has a room upstairs that we will have all to ourselves.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:10:53] Join	Dazed_75 has joined this channel (~larry@173-16-166-207.client.mchsi.com).
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:11:02] <toddc>	We'll have wifi access too.  It's going to be a good chance to eat some good grub, have a few drinks or brewski's and meet some of the other UbuGeekTODDs that you have only met online. You're not going to want to miss this.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:11:32] <Dazed_75>	Hello - sorry to be late
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:11:48] <toddc>	NP welcome
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:11:59] <xHans>	moin moin Dazed_75
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:12:07] <toddc>	Someone can pick out new features in 10.04 and present them or concentrate on one for example.  Anything to do with Ubuntu will be OK.  Things like how to navigate Launchpad and report bugs...
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:12:08] Join	Jeff_Martin has joined this channel (~jeff@student40202.student.nau.edu).
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:12:23] <toddc>	Actually, if you have a favorite piece of software that you use you can present that even if it's not in Ubuntu's repos.  Please be thinking about this.  It will only make the Release Party more of a success.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:12:39] <toddc>	Here is a link to the Lucid Lynx planning page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/LucidLynx  Feel free to add to the ideas section or fill in anything that might be missing.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:12:53] <toddc>	We will be heading there from the monthly installfest at UAT. http://tinyurl.com/yemru26 If you've never been to an installfest at UAT, you may want to consider checking it out.  Our LoCo co-sponsors it with PLUG but we are poorly represented.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:13:07] <toddc>	There's a proposed flyer posted at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1388113 please give us your feedback in the form of a vote with coments if needed.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:13:19] <toddc>	It's a chance to help another linux user or, better yet, possibly install Linux an a computer that currently is running that other OS.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:13:27] <toddc>	http://azloco.com/node/120
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:13:39] <toddc>	I've started the making plans for our next instalfest in Tucson at the University.  Andrew Lenards made the necessary introductions to get the ball rolling and start communication between us ans the CS dept. One of our team in Tucson, syn-ack, has volunteered to be our local person of contact for this.  I have sent him all contact info I have in the CS dept.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:13:52] <toddc>	So, it's time to start thinking about how we want to organize this event.  I'll need feedback from those of you that attended last time.  And I'm open to input.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:13:56] <xHans>	cool
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:14:05] <toddc>	We'll need to do alot of planning so we can put on a good show for all attendees.  Remember that the University called it a Windows Removal Event.  That's because the CS dept has migrated to Ubuntu Linux!
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:14:11] <xHans>	glad to see Tucson Installfest coming together
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:14:19] <toddc>	Id imagine they are wondering where we've been since they wanted us to schedule regular installfests.  This would be a great opportunity to promote Ubuntu Linux to students and the general public in Tucson.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:14:32] <toddc>	We'll need volunteers for a variety of duties so please please spread the word in channel and via email that we are calling for help.
[Sunday 07 March 2010] [21:14:50] <toddc>	Nagte Hutchuns brought up the point that we need to set some guidelines about hardware requirements for different types of installs at an installfest.  There are regular installs, dual boot installs, Virtual Machine installs, and Wubi installs.  Apparently there was some issue with low powered machines and VM installs.  We really should avoid trying to run into this at the next installfest.
