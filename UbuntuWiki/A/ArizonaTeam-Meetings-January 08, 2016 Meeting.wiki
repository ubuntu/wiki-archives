 04:11 <toddc> I understand it records

 04:12 <MajB> LINUX QUOTES AND JOKES:

 04:12 <MajB> 3 people had carpool: a mechanical engineer, a electrical engineer and a Microsoft programmer. But the car suddenly broke down.

 04:12 <MajB> Mechanical engineer said: "Hey! It has to be the fuel injection. Lemme fix it."

 04:12 <MajB> The electrical engineer didn't agree: "It's the magneto probably. I'll fix it."

 04:12 <MajB> Microsoft programmer shook his head and said: "Hey guys, I have a simpler idea: Let's just close all the windows, get out of the car, then get back into it, and it should run!"

 04:12 <Ron_A> Yes, but I don't know how to do it.:-)

 04:13 <MajB> There was a pilot flying a small single engine charter plane, with a couple of very important executives on board. He was coming into Seattle airport through thick fog with less than 10m visibility when his instruments went out. So he began circling around looking for landmark. After an hour or so, he starts running pretty low on fuel and the passengers are getting very nervous. Finally, a small opening in the fog appears and he sees a tall building wi

 04:13 <stephenm> you forgot to open the windows MajB

 04:13 <MajB> The passengers are amazed and one asks how he did it. "Simple" replies the pilot, "I asked the guy in that building a simple question. The answer he gave me was 100 percent correct but absolutely useless, therefore that must be Microsoft's support office and from there the airport is just a while away."

 04:14 <MajB> People say that if you play Microsoft CD's backwards, you hear satanic things, but that's nothing, because if you play them forwards, they install Windows.

 04:14 <MajB> "When you say 'I wrote a program that crashed Windows', people just stare at you blankly and say 'Hey, I got those with the system, *for free*'." -- Linus Torvalds
