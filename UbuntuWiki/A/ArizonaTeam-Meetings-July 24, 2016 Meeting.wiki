 04:13 <toddc> Linux Air

 04:13 <toddc> Disgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines decide to start their own airline. They build the planes, ticket counters, and pave the runways themselves.

 04:13 <toddc> They charge a small fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but you can also download and print the ticket yourself.

 04:13 <toddc> When you board the plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench and a copy of the Seat-HOWTO.html. Once settled, the fully adjustable seat is very comfortable

 04:13 <toddc> the plane leaves and arrives on time without a single problem, the in-flight meal is wonderful.

 04:14 <toddc> You try to tell customers of the other airlines about the great trip, but all they can say is, "You had to do what with the seat?"
