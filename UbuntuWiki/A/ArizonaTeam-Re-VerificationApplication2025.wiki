** The Arizona Team co-sponsors a Linux Installation Festival/Linux Workshop on the First and Third Saturdays of each month with the Phoenix Linux User Group (PLUG).  In addition we co-sponsor Installfest/Linux Workshops with the Cochise Linux User Group (CLUG) at various times and locations in Sierra Vista, AZ.  We currently have 1 portable server to host ISOs and have just added a PXE server to speed up some installs.  From January 2024 through 08 December 2025 we have hosted 45 installation festivals/Linux Workshops attended by 277 people resulting in 16 successful installs and numerous repairs, Linux and FOSS instruction/training sessions, and personal and Team project completions.  Because of location limitations in Tempe, AZ, the installfests there since January 2024 have been held on line becoming a Linux workshop.  The Installfests in Sierra Vista have been physical events.

** Ubuntu Hour Events are currently being held on line on <nowiki>[[https://bbb.azloco.net/|Big Blue Button]]</nowiki> on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Thursday of each month and in Sierra Vista AZ on the 2nd Thursday of each month.  From January 2024 through 08 December 2025 we have hosted 80 Ubuntu Hours (57 on line and 23 in Sierra Vista) attended by 272 people. The Ubuntu Hours in Tempe and Phoenix have been held on line since January 2024. The Ubuntu Hours in Sierra Vista were physical events.

** Team IRC meetings are held on the 1st Sunday night of each month at 9 P.M. MST. Our IRC channel, #ubuntu-us-az on http://libera.chat is operational 24 hours a day to help users with questions and communicate with team members.   From January 2024 through 01 December 2025 we have conducted 36 Team meetings.  The minutes of all Team Meetings are also sent to our mailing list to enable those who could not attend the meeting to remain current.
