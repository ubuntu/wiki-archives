Hi, nothing flashy here. 
I work in a school, have an interest in Linux and Edubuntu but I'm not a developer (...maybe that will all change later on).

I would like to help make Edubuntu really kick ass, be it testing, giving my opinion or just shouting about linux and Open Source, or even writing articles to help others.
