== AmbianceMod ==
AmbianceMod is a simple Metacity modification to the Ambiance theme.

== Concept ==
The theme is intended to restore the window control icons to their traditional locations, minimize-maximize-close on the right hand side. I've edited the button icons so they don't look ugly when reordered.

== Notes ==
Setting the theme seems to reorder the window controls, but not change the side.

<nowiki>[[attachment:bug-pic.png]]</nowiki>
 The command
'''gconftool -s --type string /apps/metacity/general/button_layout ":minimize,maximize,close"'''
should help.
