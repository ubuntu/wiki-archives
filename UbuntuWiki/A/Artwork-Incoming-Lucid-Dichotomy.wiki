=== Dichotomy ===

Dichotomy is a new work-in-progress GTK theme for the upcoming Lucid Lynx (10.04) release. Please note that all other theme elements (Icons, Pointer, Wallpaper & Metacity decoration) correspond to the new "Ambience" theme.

=== Concept ===
The purpose of this GTK theme is to integrate Ubuntu's original and distinctive identity (orange and brown) into Lucid Lynx's upcoming Brand refresh.

=== Comments ===
* Can you please this line to your gtkrc: 	GtkMenuBar::window-dragging = 1 so that it supports dragging by menubar like the default themes? BTW, thanks for the great theme. @shafin@

* @shafin: Fixed in version 0.2. Thanks for the suggestion! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:psyke83]]</nowiki> 2010-03-08

* I like this better than Ambience. Great job. That's how you we should use the GTK+ engine. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:wersdaluv]]</nowiki> 2010-03-09

* I think the orange would be better off if it wasn't so bright @yman@

* @yman: Version 0.4 has toned down the orange slightly (along with other miscellaneous changes). My intention was to create a theme with richer colours than usual; this is as far as I would be willing to compromise.  -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:psyke83]]</nowiki> <<Date>>

* @<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:psyke83]]</nowiki>: This is still better than the official Light Themes  -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:wersdaluv]]</nowiki> <<Date>>
