Hi, I'm Alfredo Matas Malavé. I worked at <nowiki>[[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/guadalinex/|C.G.A of C.E of Junta de Andalucia]]</nowiki>. 

The C.G.A is the control center of ITC schools of south region of Spain. There are about a thousand ITC schools connected to the same net. Every school has one computer each two pupils and that computer runs a modified version of Ubuntu called <nowiki>[[http://www.guadalinex.org|Guadalinex]]</nowiki>.

Now I work at <nowiki>[[http://www.emergya.es|Emergya SL]]</nowiki> since 2008
