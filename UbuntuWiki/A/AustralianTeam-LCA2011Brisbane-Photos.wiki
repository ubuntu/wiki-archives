This is a page to collect photos from the <nowiki>[[http://lca2011.linux.org.au/|LCA2011 linux.conf.au]]</nowiki> Open Day and of course focussing on the Ubuntu presence there.

=== The Kate Stewart Collection ===

These photos have all been contributed by KateStewart who kindly took lots of pictures to ensure we documented the efforts of those involved.
