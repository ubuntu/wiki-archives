21:26< johnc4510> bluecat
21:26< martyd215> Oh okay
21:26< martyd215> I was confused as to why you were waiting for a cd when you could just download it
21:26< johnc4510> bluecat is not here  but
21:27< johnc4510> jacob2440: you were working on tax exempt status were you not   for donations to comp4kids team
21:27< jacob2440> i am
21:27< johnc4510> cool   how is that going
21:27< jacob2440> I have to classify our group as a certain non-profit, so i am reading tax codes to make sure I file us properly
21:28< johnc4510> great
21:28< jacob2440> I think I have the correct one, and will be contacting the IRS next week to make sure
21:28< jacob2440> then I will get everything finished
21:28< johnc4510> excellent
21:28< ianmcorvidae> Sweet.
21:28< jacob2440> then we need to talk about who can pull money out of the account
21:28< johnc4510> nice work  and ty for the update
21:28< johnc4510> ok
21:28< ianmcorvidae> Team Approval, then: john, do you mind if I do the initial stuff on this?
21:28< johnc4510> np please do
21:28< johnc4510> :)
21:29< ianmcorvidae> Ok. All team members that haven't should go look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline/Resources
21:29< ianmcorvidae> The first is the outline for approval, the second is the volunteering sheet.
21:29< ianmcorvidae> They have both been updated since last week's meeting.
21:30< johnc4510> nice
21:30< ianmcorvidae> As the volunteer page especially shows, we can use all the help we can get on these projects.
21:30< johnc4510> true
21:30< ianmcorvidae> So, if you might be interested in a small role, please feel free to volunteer; we won't force you to be the leader :)
21:30< johnc4510> hee hee
21:30< ianmcorvidae> The CD donation and burning as well as the printer, ink, and paper sections are quite easy.
21:31< dx01> slofgren: got it your message, will do
21:31< ianmcorvidae> Since, they pretty much just involve donating materials for others to use.
21:31< ianmcorvidae> So, please look into these two pages and volunteer where you'd like.
21:31< ianmcorvidae> We'll continue to update these pages with more tasks that may need completion.
21:32< ianmcorvidae> So check back every so often, although every Sunday, we'll tell you if they've been updated.
21:32< ianmcorvidae> johnc4510, take it from here :)
21:32< johnc4510> nicely done ty ianmcorvidae    i do have some more on this though
21:32< johnc4510> ignore last part
21:32< johnc4510> hee hee
21:32< johnc4510> We need to get an idea of how many, of what version of Feisty, and who has burned CD's for the team. I think the best way is to add an area on the volunteer page so that the people who volunteered to burn them can edit in that information.
21:33< johnc4510> Ian, as our resident guru on wiki page setups, could you add that to the page for us?
21:33< ianmcorvidae> Sure.
21:33< johnc4510> ty much appreciated
21:33< johnc4510> so, then as you burn cd's or make flyers you can add it to the wiki page
21:34< johnc4510> does that seem appropriate to all
21:34< johnc4510> ?
21:34< johnc4510> ianmcorvidae: ?
21:34< ianmcorvidae> Seems effective tome.
21:34< ianmcorvidae> Adding right now :)
21:34< johnc4510> good
21:34< johnc4510> ty
21:34< johnc4510> next
21:35< johnc4510> Next, we need to work on the flyer and the jewel case insert.
21:35< ianmcorvidae> Actually, waiting a bit. Someone else was editing :)
21:35< ianmcorvidae> Yes, we do.
21:35< johnc4510> Most of us that are working on that project are going to be at the Saturday get together for the Tucson members.
21:35< johnc4510> So you folks need to be thinking about what we want in the way of design and content.
21:35< johnc4510> Then we can get it formatted correctly to let the people who volunteered to print them set up.
21:36< johnc4510> And of course present it to the other members for approval.
21:36< johnc4510> how does that sound to all
21:36< johnc4510> ?
21:37< johnc4510> ?
21:37< dx01> good
21:37< johnc4510> ty
21:37< jacob2440> good
21:37< johnc4510> ty
21:37< ianmcorvidae> Excellent.
21:37< johnc4510> just trying to make sure you are paying attention :)
21:37< johnc4510> hee hee
21:38< johnc4510> ianmcorvidae: anything else on this project from you
21:38< johnc4510> or anyone else for that matter
