Jan 30 21:27:25 LostPenguin http://gizmodo.com/5483632/apple-sues-htc-for-infringing-on-20-iphone-patents-the-complete-documents
Jan 30 21:28:13 * paul928 has quit (Quit: Page closed)
Jan 30 21:36:28 toddc nice read but very similar to the old MS lawsuit that they never acted on but I can also see two coders writing the same code for two different projects and if the code is even similar or along the same function or thought could be considered copyrighted sadly but I guess the courts will have to decide
Jan 30 21:37:57 LostPenguin apple was sued by a forign company trying to say the patent is too broad but they lost.
