== CD Artwork in Icons ==

CD cover artwork as desktop representation of inserted cd.
=== Concept ===
CD cover art is used in media players as a nice elegant way to show the currently inserted cd. It would look really 'classy' if we were able to superimpose the same cover artwork onto a svg rendered cd case icon on the desktop rather than just the generic cd icon. The image could be retrieved directly from the internet or by checking rhythmbox for a locally cached image. Obviously a fallback would be required if there is no internet connectivity or local cached image.

A related idea is to replace the icon's text of 'audio cd' with the artist/album name.

=== Comments ===

* I really like the idea! Think that'd make a real improvement to the desktop experience. But afaik this isn't just a design question, because you don't just have to change an icon, but somebody has to code it (maybe this is more a question for Nautilus or Gnome than for Ubuntu?!). -- DanielT
