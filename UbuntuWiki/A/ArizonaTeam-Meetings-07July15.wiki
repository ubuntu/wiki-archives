21:20 < Polygon89> yay
21:20 < johnc4510> don't know if it is in or not
21:20 < johnc4510> or installed
21:20 < johnc4510> i will try to find out from dx00 this wk what is going on
21:20 < johnc4510> :)
21:21 < johnc4510> moving on
21:21 < johnc4510> Comp4Kids Team
21:21 <  bluecat9> Yes
21:21 <  bluecat9> I haven't had much time to think about this proposal...
21:21 <  bluecat9> but I want to propose something
21:21 < johnc4510> k
21:21 <  bluecat9> eliminate the Computers 4 Kids and replace it with a Donation page
21:22 <  bluecat9> people (not us) can donate money or computers
21:22 <  bluecat9> or hardware i suppose
21:22 <     w9fyi> I like that idea.
21:22 <  bluecat9> and we will use that to build/buy computers for kids
21:22 <  bluecat9> without computers
21:22 <     Apple> that's a good idea
21:22 <  bluecat9> and possibly lugs also
21:22 < johnc4510> bluecat9: can we keep comp4kids and add the donation page?
21:22 <  bluecat9> lug members who do not have a pc to install linux on
21:23 < Polygon89> i see.
21:23 < johnc4510> ok, 
21:23 <  bluecat9> i think we should just have a donation page, but a section that tells what we do with the donations
21:23 <  bluecat9> the main focus being computers for kids
21:23 <  bluecat9> i have contacts for companies that will donate
21:23 <     w9fyi> maybe some cases where it has help?
21:23 <  bluecat9> if i put the focus on C4K
21:23 < johnc4510> what do other members think?
21:23 <  bluecat9> the focus should remain on C4K
21:23 < johnc4510> agreed
21:24 <  bluecat9> but i want to generalize and change to Donation page
21:24 <  bluecat9> and get that rolling
21:24 <      br24> a very interesting idea
21:24 *** johnc4510 admits he has let this project down personally
21:24 < jacob2440> i agree
21:24 <      br24> maybe donations that can also lead to other projects
21:24 < johnc4510> :/
21:24 < jacob2440> i like the donations idea
21:24 < johnc4510> me too
21:24 <  bluecat9> br24, agreed
21:24 < jacob2440> I can get us a Tax number for free so we can take em...
21:24 <  bluecat9> yes
21:25 <  bluecat9> we need that
21:25 <  bluecat9> for sure
21:25 < jacob2440> if blue's companies want proof that we are non-profit
21:25 <  bluecat9> as soon as i can get a web page up and a tax # i can start getting donations
21:25 -!- SloggerKhan [n=SloggerK@dhcp-80c4c240.rescomp.arizona.edu] has joined #ubuntu-arizona

21:25 < SloggerKh> hi all, sorry to interupt
21:25 < johnc4510> bluecat9: ok, you will need to change the team wiki page around then
21:25 <      br24> more, the merrier
21:25 < johnc4510> SloggerKhan: np
21:25 < jacob2440> we will need an 'accountant' to file our taxes...

21:26 <  bluecat9> johnc4510, a domain name will help too ;)

21:27 < SloggerKh> soory
21:27 < martyd215> How long does it take to get a tax id #?
21:27 <  bluecat9> I'm sort of going to shift my focus into getting us funding --the group can decide what is best to spend it on
21:27 < johnc4510> SloggerKhan: did you want to say something?
21:27 < SloggerKh> no
21:27 < johnc4510> k

21:35 < johnc4510> jacob2440: should handle the funds too
21:35 < johnc4510> i think
21:35 < martyd215> are they donating money or hardware?
21:35 <  bluecat9> How well do we really know this Jacob guy anyway? lol jk
21:35 < jacob2440> we would need to set up a bank account

21:36 *** bluecat9 looks at John "this guy is allright"
21:37 < johnc4510> ok, we should have another phoenix person who can sign and deposit too
21:37 < jacob2440> it will be all online
21:37 <  bluecat9> sweet
21:37 < johnc4510> so we always have access

21:37 < jacob2440> that way people can just transfer funds electronically
21:37 < johnc4510> ok
21:37 < jacob2440> and i can add as many bank accounts as needed
21:37 < jacob2440> through these companies
21:37 < johnc4510> sounds good
21:38 < jacob2440> and i will give everyone a password and username to view the money
21:38 < johnc4510> everyone agreed with that
21:38 < johnc4510> ?
21:38 < jacob2440> we might want to restrict how many people can take money out of it
21:38 <  bluecat9> johnc4510, yes
21:38 < johnc4510> +1
21:38 <  bluecat9> +1
