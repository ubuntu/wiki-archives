Mail Address : <AngeloOvidi AT netscape DOT net>

I'm a network and systems administrator and I work on Linux and Internet since 1992. I come from "The Debian School" but in the last two years I was converted to Ubuntu. I'm working actually also on Nexenta  project as a part-time developer. In the past I've developed patched Linux kernels and tools supporting xfs and gfs filesystems. I had a project on Sourceforge called XFdeb ([WWW] http://xfdeb.sourceforge.net/).

I live in Rome (Italy), exactly in a little apartment in Ostia Beach, near the sea, with my cat :)
