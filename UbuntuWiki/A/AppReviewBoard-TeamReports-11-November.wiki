* Review pilot scheme
** Allison had taken the first session a week prior to the meeting, creating packaging for a few applications & submitting one to Debian
* Issues to resolve
** Quickly creates packages that build-depend on the deprecated python-support, instead of dh_python2
*** [ACTION] Luke to look into fixing <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-distutils-extra/+bug/894582|bug 894582]]</nowiki>
** Applications submitted without source, which need to be 
*** [Action] Allison to create https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Review/Responses
* Applications submitted that aren't 'useful'
** Discussion of what guidelines we should use for rejecting applications summarised on http://pad.ubuntu.com/arb-guidelines
*** Submissions should be applications, not stand-alone documentation or media (image bundles, fonts, movies).
*** Apps should not be forks of existing applications in the Ubuntu archive (main/universe/etc).
*** Apps must be useful or interesting to a general audience.
*** The process only applies to a specific version of an application (e.g. PyJunior 1.0 or PyJunior 1.2).
*** No other software can depend on the application being submitted (e.g. development libraries should be submitted to main/universe or upstream to Debian instead).
*** Applications must be Free/Libre/Open Source software. We follow the Ubuntu Licensing Policy [http://people.canonical.com/~cjwatson/ubuntu-policy/policy.html/ch-archive.html#s-ulp].
*** When an application is approved as part of this process, Ubuntu developers may make changes or improvements to a package before it is uploaded to the archive or after it is in the archive.
*** Applications must be able to be built with tools & libraries in the Ubuntu archive. Apps may bundle additional libraries they depend on, but may not include new versions of already packaged libraries.

* Backports & ARB submissions
** ARB applications should be able to depend on backported libraries
** [ACTION] Andrew to ask about technical limitations of ARB apps depending on backported packages

* Next meeting time:
** Last Friday of December doesn't work well for most people, next meeting time was decided as 9th december, 18:00 UTC where we'll decide if we need a mid-January meeting.
** Next chair for meeting is Stéphane Graber
