=== Future Ubuntu plans ===

* To help grow the Ubuntu Honduras community and engage people to support us in carrying out various projects and help us promote the use of Ubuntu in Honduras.

* Encourage team members to make our channel # ubuntu-hn a friendly place where anyone feels like to go for help or support.

* Work closely with the rest of the team for the realization of Ubuntu Tour and reach as many schools and colleges to convince them that Ubuntu is the best choice in Software.

* Organize the project "Ubuntu for every school" and give the opportunity to every school in low economic resources, to have at least one or two computers running Ubuntu.

=== Testimonials ===
* I am the first one. Tatica1 is a great person, she rocks. She was the person who gave life to the <nowiki>[[HondurasTeam]]</nowiki>. With her help, we have organized events here in Honduras. She is a nice lady. Always available at IRC, trying to help others, and if she can't she gets you someone to help you. Tatica1 may have trouble sometimes on ubuntu, but she always go ahead and solve her problems. She is a great example here in Honduras. Go tatica1. <nowiki>[[DiegoTurcios|DiegoTc]]</nowiki>
  
* Tatica1's job is really great, I am completely convinced that the Ubuntu community is so accessible and so comfortable thanks to people like her with her willingness to always learn new things and always help as much as possible. The Ubuntu community needs more people like you !!  <nowiki>[[DKcross|DKcross]]</nowiki> ''' Ubuntu Member''' ,Ubuntu El Salvador y  Ubuntu Centroamerica.
