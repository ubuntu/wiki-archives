__TOC__

== Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn ==
The graphics (the beautiful progress bar) after selection of Ubuntu from the list of OSes (dual boot) and before the login screen, are blacked out (appears as a blank screen). Same is the behavior after shutdown and before the computer actually shuts down.
 
This is the only noticeable problem I have encountered as of now. (This might be related to some configuration that I will have to look into). 

Everything else seems to be working fine.
