System where everything revolves around Ubuntu

* ubuntu - the center of the solar system! i think the idea is expandable. let's found a religion! -- Eiche 
* I really enjoy it! I'm gonna try and out this in GNOME Art or something for everyone to download sometime. Oh, and there's a problem with the files you've uploaded. Whenever I click on the name of the file to download it, I have to rename it to a .jpeg for it to work. Excelent work, though! -- Toadinator
