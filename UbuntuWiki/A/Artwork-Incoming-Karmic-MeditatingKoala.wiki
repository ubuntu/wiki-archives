===== Comments =====
* I really like this image, it is nice and simple. The arms feel a little too stiff, and the legs seem a bit off as well. I think the logo behind his head works nicely. Well done. I think this artwork feels very playful and relaxed, which would work in many scenarios. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:adam-w-knox]]</nowiki> 
* This is really great! If shrunk down to fit the wallet size, this (IMO) would be an excellent CD Case front cover. But, I know that Mr. Shuttleworth said that colours will be changing this release - so I don't know if the colours will match. -- oddeyed. 
* I love the little fellow! Has he got a name yet? :D -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:strangequark]]</nowiki> === Koala's Karma ===

===== Comments =====
* The "animals shadow" looks a bit scary, evil. Another color and friendlier eyes could change that. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:t-w-]]</nowiki>
* Good work on the 2nd poster, with colored animals. I think you should try to vary the eye shapes a bit and try a version without eyes. The shape of the jackalope needs work, it shouldn't bend forward so much at the lower left. The slogan should be with "has", not "have", but just "Good Karma" would be best. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:t-w-]]</nowiki>  * I've tried without eyes, but it's not good. However, I've upload a new version of koala karma. Eyes are now differents for each animals.
* As already stated, the black and white one looks a bit too intense with the shape of the eyes, which is corrected in the color version. I think the black and white does look better, as it draws the focus to the koala, rather then the previous versions of Ubuntu. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:tylerbrainerd]]</nowiki>  * It's ok. I replaced eyes into the dark version. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:adrien-pilleboue]]</nowiki>  * It looks great! Nicely done. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:tylerbrainerd]]</nowiki>  * The colour version is perfect! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:strangequark]]</nowiki>  * "Ubuntu has good karma" is the correct grammar. -- -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:naturaltwig]]</nowiki>  * I really like this poster, I'm going to grok inkscape so I can play around with it a bit, but not because I feel it needs any modification.  I agree with <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:t-w-]]</nowiki> that it should be "Good Karma", but apart from that I think it looks great. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:yoda2031]]</nowiki>

===== Comments =====
* Keep it up, great work so far ;)  -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:sidi]]</nowiki>  * Excellent work. BTW, please specify a license like you can see on the Backgrounds page. Consider posting to the mailing list, as not everyone monitors the wiki and more people should see this! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:t-w-]]</nowiki>  * The under-arm fur looks odd from a gravity perspective. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:melissa]]</nowiki>  * Update : I deleted the under-arm fur and improve the netbook. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:adrien-pilleboue]]</nowiki>  * I liked very much this poster, simply and fun. ^^. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:daniplanas-a]]</nowiki> 2009-05-26 09:10
* This turned out really nice. Maybe change his eyes a little? That would be my only suggestion. Very playful -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:adam-w-knox]]</nowiki>  * If this is about the Netbook Remix, why is it showing two panels and unmaximised windows? -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:strangequark]]</nowiki>  * A small detail, but still a valid point. Good eye, strangequark. This never occurred to me when viewing this artwork before. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:blueyonder64]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

==== Ubuntu and Gwibber ====
Poster about Ubuntu's gwibber integration

<nowiki>[[attachment:necropotame_koala_gwibber.svg|SVG sources]]</nowiki>

===== Comments =====
* I wouldn't go as far as adding Facebook and Twitter (or any other!) logos in here. Although the inclusion of Gwibber is nice, the opinions about "The Right Microblogging Platform" will end badly: 'what about identi.ca, jaiku, brightkite? twitter and facebook are closed source rubbish!' -- -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:myrtti]]</nowiki> 
* I think this picture could do with some under-arm fur. :-? He looks a bit too slick to me. Go on and rough him up! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:strangequark]]</nowiki>

=== washburnello's koala ===
* Hello, I'm new but liked your work and thought I'd play around with it. I changed the Jackalope to 9.04 and gave it more of a meditative feel i think. Trash it if you like cause like I said, I was just playing with it. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:washburnello]]</nowiki> 2009-05-18 15:02:35
