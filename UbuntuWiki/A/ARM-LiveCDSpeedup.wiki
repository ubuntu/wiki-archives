__TOC__

This page details the investigation into slowness on the Ubuntu Live-CD image, specifically on, but not limited to, the ARM platform.

== Next Steps ==
A list of work items to improve the live-cd boot process are as follows.
* Speed up debconf-communicate by calling it just once, leaving it persistent through the use of a FIFO mechanism.
* Change the dpkg -P gdm-guest-session to simply rm -r /usr/share/gdm/guest-session
* Re-evaluate bootcharts to determine if there is any more scope for improvement.
