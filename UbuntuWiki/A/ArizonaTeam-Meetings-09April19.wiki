21:11 < johnc4510> xHans: let everyone know they are welcome please
21:12 < johnc4510> i'll talk to paula
21:12 < johnc4510> :)
21:12 < tyche> So will I.  HEH HEH HEH
21:12 < xHans> johnc4510: ok
21:12 < johnc4510> jurelex: we have a release party and then installfests that follow later
21:13 < johnc4510> please come and bring a friend or two
21:13 < johnc4510> :)
21:13 < tyche> johnc4510: other way around.
21:13 < johnc4510> get to know some of the folks
21:13 < johnc4510> :)
21:13 < tyche> The install fest for Phoenix is at UAT.
21:13 < jurelex> I will, I want to try kubuntu
21:13 < johnc4510> yes, info on the linked page
21:13 < johnc4510> cool
21:13 < johnc4510> look for tyche...he's the big ugly one
21:13 < johnc4510> lol
21:13 < johnc4510> jk
21:14 < Jeff_Martin> you mean tyche is the big one?
21:14 < johnc4510> right
21:14 < johnc4510> lol
21:14 < MatthewMPP> xHans: Thanks, but that link did not work. This link worked better for me: http://plug.phoenix.az.us/event/ical but again only for about 30 days worth.
21:14 < johnc4510> ok, we need to start thinking about the installfests
21:14 < as2000> jurelex: waiting for the KDS 3.5 remix
21:14 < johnc4510> get the ball rolling so to speak
21:14 < tyche> jurelex: You should be able to recognize me:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/22090195@N03/3103654354/
21:14 < johnc4510> ooooooooh, you'll scare him with that pic
21:15 < johnc4510> we lose more members that way
21:15 < johnc4510> :(
21:15 < xHans> MatthewMPP: that's the iCal link, you need the rss feed link
21:15 < johnc4510> ok, so i don't have a lot more, i thought we might discuss who's using the RC and what problems
21:16 < johnc4510> see if we can help any
21:16 < johnc4510> ?
21:16 < MatthewMPP> This is the link you just gave me:http://plug.phoenix.az.us/event/2009/04/19/feed/all/all/
21:16 < xHans> RC is working, but had some borken dependencies
21:16 < johnc4510> i know tyche has had some problems and has gone native with KDE on us
21:16 < johnc4510> :)
21:16 < Thugal> pulse bug in pidgin seems to be fixed, so people that manually went alsa can now go back to using the default.
21:17 < tyche> Yep.  But at least I can hear some music that isn't flattened out into monaural sound due to PulseAudio
21:17 < johnc4510> we've be seeing a ton of udates each week for a bit now
21:17 < xHans> MatthewMPP: http://plug.phoenix.az.us/event/feed is probably the correct URL
21:17 < MatthewMPP> Pidgin crashes a lot on me.
21:17 < johnc4510> so we know the devs are pushing stuff out
21:17 < MatthewMPP> xHans: thanks
21:17 < johnc4510> tyche: is kde not using pulse at all?
21:18 < xHans> flash needs to be removed in order for it to work, which is strange
21:18 < johnc4510> yeah
21:18 < tyche> Hmmm.  I haven't brought pidgin into this yet.
21:18 < xHans> does gnash now handle swf 9?
21:18 < Wolf_45> Only problems I've had are due to my lack of memory.  Errr, *computer* memory, that is!
21:18 < xHans> MatthewMPP: bitte
21:18 < tyche> johnc4510: As far as I can tell, it isn't using it.
21:18 < johnc4510> jurelex: are you using the new version yet?
21:18 < johnc4510> hmm
21:18 < johnc4510> a plus for them i'd say
21:18 < MatthewMPP> xHans: bitte?
21:19 < Wolf_45> You're welcome.  :-)
21:19 < johnc4510> well, i really have had no problems for a while with jaunty
21:19 < xHans> MatthewMPP: bitte == your welcome
21:19 < johnc4510> i'm running 32 bit this time on both boxes
21:20 < johnc4510> so i can get skype video to work
21:20 < MatthewMPP> okay
21:20 < johnc4510> as we all know, it didn't in 64 bit in 8.10
21:20 < johnc4510> which was a pain
21:20 < johnc4510> skype video is fine in jaunty 32 bit
21:21 < tyche> Oh, gad.  You mean when I fire up the Mini 9, I get to see your ugly face?  Talk about scaring people.
21:21 < jurelex> I installed 8.10 and update a week ago to 9.04
21:21 < tyche> Hee hee
21:21 < johnc4510> jurelex: what's the name of your computer shop?
21:21 < jurelex> Desert Computers
21:21 < johnc4510> jurelex: upgrade went ok?
21:21 < johnc4510> ah
21:21 < johnc4510> nods
21:21 < johnc4510> i'm in tucson myself
21:22 < johnc4510> but we have a lot of phoenix folks here
21:22 < johnc4510> tyche: you have webcam in the mini?
21:22 < MatthewMPP> xHans: no that one does not work at all.
21:22 < jurelex> yes, everything fine... the only problem that I have is with VLC when I try to playback DVDs but I'm sure is not related to the update
21:23 < xHans> MatthewMPP: not sure what to try, then
21:23 < as2000> have you tried installing libdvdcss?
21:23 < johnc4510> could be a compiz problem is you're running that jurelex
21:23 < tyche> jurelex: Get the repositories from medibuntu.  That should set you up with all the codecs you need.
21:23 < johnc4510> yeah that might do it too
21:23 < MatthewMPP> I have AZloco and Fridge both working properly.  And I can load about 30 days worth of PLUG.
21:24 < johnc4510> jurelex: http://www.medibuntu.org/
21:24 < johnc4510> add those repos to your /etc/apt/sources.list
21:24 < jurelex> as2000: yep I tried, but still nothing... I've messed so much with this installation that I think I will reinstall fresh
21:24 < johnc4510> nods
21:25 < johnc4510> always a good way to go
21:25 < MatthewMPP> xHans: got a permissions notice back on the last link you gave me.
21:25 < jurelex> I will try the 9.04 when it comes out
21:25 < johnc4510> jurelex: here is our team website: http://azloco.com/
21:25 < johnc4510> if your signed up with our team in launchpad, you can register an account
21:26 < johnc4510> all the links are on that page
21:26 < jurelex> perfect, will do
21:26 < johnc4510> mailing list is another good thing to sign up for
21:26 < as2000> jurelex: sure hate to see you go through all of that only to re-install.
21:26 < as2000> sometimes its best
21:26 < johnc4510> we put our a newsletter every wed. to keep everyone up to date
21:26 < tyche> as2000: Sometimes, it's the only way.
21:27 < jurelex> I want to try kubuntu so it's OK
21:27 < as2000> :)
21:27 < johnc4510> :)
21:27 < as2000> not much of a fan of 4.+, glad they are doing a 3.5 remix
21:27 < johnc4510> ok, we can go on visiting in a bit...I want to give xHans a chance to give the state lug news
21:27 < tyche> jurelex: KDE is like nothing you've seen before, unless you've tangled with some other LiveCDs.  If you have a problem, holler andI'll try to help you.
21:27 < johnc4510> xHans: announcements?
21:28 < johnc4510> yeah, we're here for support
21:28 < MatthewMPP> on my kubuntu install I have everything working including the screen saver, however, the computer never goes to sleep. It just runs the screen saver all day.
21:28 < johnc4510> hmm
21:29 < tyche> MatthewMPP: I have the reverse problem.  Mine always goes to sleep.  I can't get it to stay in screensaveer.
21:29 < MatthewMPP> try installing xscreensaver.
21:29 < johnc4510> ok, xHans seems to be off busy
21:29 < jurelex> now, a question that I have... I'm using an old laptop (Pentium M 1.5Ghz, 512MB,40GB) do you think is enough for kubuntu... gnome works OK
21:29 < johnc4510> so we'll continue until he returns...or i fall asleep
21:29 < johnc4510> so we'll continue until he returns...or i fall asleep
21:30 < johnc4510> lol
21:30 < tyche> I think I did.  Especially since there weren't any installed by default
21:30 < johnc4510> should be ok, although you may not get compiz effects
21:30 < xHans> johnc4510: yeah
21:30 < tyche> jurelex: It should do fine.  I've got a Dell Mini 9 that I put Intrepid on (the full thing) and it works great.
21:30 < johnc4510> k
21:30  * xHans was looking up info on one :)
21:30 < as2000> can you bring memory up to 1G?
21:31 < tyche> True about compiz.
