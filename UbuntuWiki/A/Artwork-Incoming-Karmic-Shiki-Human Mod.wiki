=== Shiki-Human Mod ===

It's a little bit dark and has smooth light colors. These are only a few attributes of the Shiki-Colors Theme. But I was unsatisfied with the Murrine-SVN-Mod. To my mind the theme was too flat and therefore boring. So I decided to modify the Theme a little bit to make it more attractive.

'''Those, who don't like it glassy should tell me. The gummy-style would look good too.'''

'''''<nowiki>[[attachment:Shiki-Human.tar.gz|Download]]</nowiki>'''''

=== Modifications ===
* Scrollbar-Steppers are visible
* A glassy style added to each widget
* Toolbar gradient
* Bold text removed
* Shiki-Colors-Metacity is now called Shiki-Human
* rounded Panel-toggle buttons
* selected menu-items use the original @selected_bg_color (before it was "shade (0.85, @selected_bg_color)")
* instead of gnome-human icons Humanity icons are used

=== Humanity Icons ===
Of course you can use the icon-theme you like, but this theme will use the Humanity Icons by default.

Here you can download. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Karmic/Humanity_Icons]]</nowiki>
