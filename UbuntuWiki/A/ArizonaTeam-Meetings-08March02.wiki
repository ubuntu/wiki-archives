[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:07:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	then we'll discuss
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:07:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:08:32] <soldats>	johnc4510-laptop: to let you know i had made a new post on my thread with a few other pics i made as well with different levels of finishness
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:08:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: what thread?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:08:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	link please
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:09:04] <ianmcorvidae>	in either case there are grammatical and puncutation errors that need correction
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:09:06] <soldats>	the one i made for the flyer
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:09:35] <soldats>	johnc4510-laptop: the original theread i made on our forum
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:09:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	ianmcorvidae: sure, these are not the final product
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:09:46] <ianmcorvidae>	just wanted to say
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:09:48] <ianmcorvidae>	:)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:09:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: i think that is the original thread
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:09:57] <soldats>	yyea i noticed as well
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:10:10] <kennymc0>	looks good from what i see
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:10:19] <kennymc0>	text seems a little crouded though
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:10:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	kennymc0: which one?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:10:38] <kennymc0>	install fest flyer
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:10:42] <soldats>	its a quick mockup i did last night
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:10:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	the one soldats made or tyche
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:10:53] <kennymc0>	the one soldats made
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:11:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: ty
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:11:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:11:16] <ianmcorvidae>	I like the layout of tyche's better, but they would both work
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:11:22] <paul928>	soldats:what's the link to the latest version?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:11:31] <ianmcorvidae>	the desktop-mockup thing just doesn't appeal to me :)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:11:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:11:59] <soldats>	its on the thread. i posted my photobucket and all the pics i have
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:12:10] <kennymc0>	i actually kinda like it but it does kinda limit the ammount of text that you can have
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:12:25] <kennymc0>	which is why it looks very crowded with all the text that it has
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:12:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, now
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:12:46] <rich1>	i like the desktop idea.  but it's a little cluttered.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:13:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	the one tyche made is for the hardy release, but could easily be adapted for the installfest too
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:13:23] <rich1>	maybe we could have 3 or 4 different flyers each with a different desktop.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:13:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	rich1: maybe
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:14:04] <johnc4510-laptop>	it would involve different templates being made
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:14:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:14:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	we need to proceed in one direction or the other i think
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:14:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	so a vote
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:15:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	for soldats vote +1 now
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:15:11] <kennymc0>	+1

[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:15:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	close
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:15:29] <rich1>	i'm not a member yet so no vote for me.

[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:16:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: you can vote for yourself
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:16:06] <tyche>	I can't vote, I've got an entry in there and am biased
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:16:14] <kennymc0>	lol
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:16:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so it looks like soldats   congrats
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:16:55] <johnc4510-laptop>	but we need a lot of work on it still
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:16:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:00] <soldats>	yea
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:08] <kennymc0>	yeah
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	first, i would like to see the dock at the bottom gone
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	because
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:23] <ianmcorvidae>	Might I suggest we represent the ubuntu desktop as it actually appears... yeah
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:28] <ianmcorvidae>	john beat me :)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	and it takes a graphics card to get that
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	not everyone will have that
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:17:59] <kennymc0>	yeah it looks kinda macish like it is
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:18:00] <kennymc0>	lol
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:18:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	is that ok ?  vote now please
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:18:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	losing the dock
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:18:39] <tyche>	+1
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:18:44] <ianmcorvidae>	if ubuntu shipped with avant window navigator, I'd say go with it... but it doesn't, and it's not even in the repos :)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:18:47] <ianmcorvidae>	+1
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:19:10] <kennymc0>	+1
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:19:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	enigmastrat: vote?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:19:28] <tyche>	I like the idea,  because it defines some of the programs that come with the distro.  But it is misleading.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:19:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	agreed
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:19:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so we lose the dock
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:19:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	now
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:19:55] <enigmastrat>	I was spacing.... sorry
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:20:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	for some of my ideas to bite the dust
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:20:05] <enigmastrat>	I'm checking out the images on the forum right now
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:20:10] <tyche>	What about the user@ubuntu. . .  ?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:20:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	the test is not to the point i don't thing
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:20:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	think
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:20:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's too general and it doesn't make good points
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:21:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	however, the text in tyche's does make the right points
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:21:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:21:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:21:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	comments
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:21:24] <enigmastrat>	ah... :) +1
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:21:30] <tyche>	Yea, but there's a lot of text there.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:21:42] <kennymc0>	i think that the text is a little too much of the flier but we could try to make a brochure to go with it
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:21:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	yes, but we could pare it down some i think
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:21:55] <kennymc0>	that way you can post the flier and hand out the brochure
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:22:04] <tyche>	OK +1
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:22:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	hmm
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:22:14] <kennymc0>	and a brochure lets you have a lot more text :)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:22:16] <paul928>	+1
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:22:16] <kennymc0>	just a thought
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:22:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: is that an ok to what
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:22:37] <tyche>	An ok to using the text, but paring it down.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:22:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:22:52] <paul928>	flier + brochure?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:23:00] 	 * johnc4510-laptop remember, we are going to have to print these
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:23:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	and
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:23:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	two things means twice as much paper and ink
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:23:19] <kennymc0>	well if we make it so that the color isnt very important i can print a lot out at school
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:23:41] <kennymc0>	color not being important because they are black and white laser printers there
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:23:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'd like to keep the color is at all possible
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:23:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	but that's something to think about
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	color makes it a little more professional i think
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:23] <kennymc0>	well make it so that if it was printed in black and white that you could still tell what everything is
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:27] <paul928>	and how much would Staples charge to print?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	not sure
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:39] <tyche>	Or office max
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:48] <enigmastrat>	it's like $.30 a copy
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	i plan on doing some at my house for me
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:52] <enigmastrat>	(color)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:55] <kennymc0>	they might say on their website ill check real quick
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:24:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	pretty expensive
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:25:05] <soldats>	if colol ill be paying to make the copies and doing it
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:25:42] <tyche>	I can do some printing here.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:25:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	me too
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:25:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	and
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:25:57] <paul928>	maybe we need a PayPal contribution link for members?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:26:04] <kennymc0>	i can do printing too
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:26:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	if some can't do color, well that's ok too
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:26:27] <enigmastrat>	I've got two laser printers.... (b&w though :( )
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:26:35] <rich1>	i'd be happy to donate.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:26:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:27:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	i idea is for each member to print and distribute as many fliers as possible
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:27:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	but
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:27:30] <enigmastrat>	john, did you get my e-mail about the location?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:27:32] <soldats>	so i was kinda busy the last 15 minutes, so can i get a quick run down of changes and which flyer will be used
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:27:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	some of us can help fill in the gaps i think
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:27:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: we are going to drop the dock
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:27:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	and
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:28:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe try to use the text in tyche's
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:28:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	but pared down some
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:28:24] <soldats>	ok cool
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:28:30] <soldats>	what else
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:28:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	we're talking about printing right now
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:28:47] <tyche>	soldats: If you get with me later and give me an email address, I can send you the ODT file.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:28:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	but it's general
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:28:59] <soldats>	tyche: ok
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:29:07] <kennymc0>	office max color prints are 49 cents a piece
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:29:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	lets talk about how to cut down the text
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:29:33] <enigmastrat>	ouch
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:29:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	first, the space between each item might be dropped
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:30:20] <ianmcorvidae>	however, spacing improves readability
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:30:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: does your flier use 1 page only as it is?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:30:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	true
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:30:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	ian
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:30:47] <tyche>	Yes, It was set up for an 8 1/2 X 11 page, with 1/4 inch margins.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:30:58] <tyche>	1/2 inch center, to allow it to fold.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:31:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:31:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	what about losing the "new look" in column one
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:31:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:31:59] <tyche>	OK
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:32:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's advertising 3d and that takes a graphics card
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:32:18] <tyche>	BTW, I'm doing this as you chat, so give me a second  or two in between
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:32:31] <ianmcorvidae>	also, will we be supporting wubi?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:32:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:32:44] <ianmcorvidae>	because if we won't be helping people with that, we should probably not mention it on the flyer either :)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:32:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	i won't but some might
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:32:57] <soldats>	im not
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:07] <tyche>	I wouldn't know how.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, maybe we can lose that too
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	and
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	the "what's new"
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:23] <tyche>	OK, gone
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	has an explanation
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	it could just be a header
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:37] <kennymc0>	staples color copies are 44 cents a piece
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	wow
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	44 dollars a hundred
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:33:59] <soldats>	im good on the money for copies so no big deal for me
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:34:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:34:15] <kennymc0>	i can print them at home for cheaper
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:34:20] <kennymc0>	takes longer but it's cheaper
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:34:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	comments on the "what's new" as a header only
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:34:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	no explanation
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:35:08] <tyche>	That would be better, but we need some other things that are new.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:35:26] <kennymc0>	we can explain the new stuff when we are there
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:35:38] <kennymc0>	another incentive for people to show up :)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:35:58] <soldats>	so another idea i had was to have the flyer i did be more of a window flyer for direct advertisement to catch people as well as having stacks of smaller ones inside stores to hand out as reminders. also we can still hand both out but if its not in aggreeance ill still try to make smaller ones on my time and see how you guys feel.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:36:02] <paul928>	this InstallFest will be in Phoenix and Tucson on the same day?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:36:10] <soldats>	no paul928
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:36:13] <ianmcorvidae>	paul928: presumably, yes
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:36:13] <tyche>	Pull the "Here are a few featured ones:" and leave the rest
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:36:32] <kennymc0>	that would work
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:36:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: kill the Wubi, but we want the dual boot somewhere
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:36:56] <tyche>	Then pull the Firefox 3, completely
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:37:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:37:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	we should
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:37:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	have one paragraph listing the new or existing apps
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:37:56] <soldats>	if we are pulling the text we did last week with tyches text we still need room to at least explain what an installfest is
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:38:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	like firefox, email,   listed that way
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:38:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: agreed
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:38:31] <tyche>	Yes
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:38:35] <ianmcorvidae>	the text we did last week can be pared down to fit the first column; keep the second column
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:38:38] <soldats>	keep that in mind
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:38:39] <ianmcorvidae>	that would be my take
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:38:55] <johnc4510-laptop>	ianmcorvidae: that might work good
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:39:09] <ianmcorvidae>	s/good/well/ ;)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:39:11] <ianmcorvidae>	but yes
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:39:12] <ianmcorvidae>	:P
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:39:29] <soldats>	i made a new gobby session with the text i have now so if possible we can edit this all to fit there at some point. it labled as AZ_flyer_new.txt i think
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:39:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, the other area i see a problem with is at the bottom of the first column
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:39:48] <soldats>	it was pared down a whole lot as well
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:40:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:40:03] <tyche>	Take out the "Get it now"
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:40:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	and the family friendly help needs changing
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:40:48] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:40:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	to something like   we supply free support
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:41:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	or something like that
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:41:18] <soldats>	s/supply/offer
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:41:37] <tyche>	Free support available.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:41:37] <ianmcorvidae>	soldats beat me :P
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:41:40] <kennymc0>	we offer friendly knowledgable support maybe?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:41:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	The Arizona Loco Team Provides Free Support
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:42:12] <soldats>	yes but all of the ubuntu community as a whole offers free support
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:42:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	something along any of those lines
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:42:22] <kennymc0>	support will always run $0.00 an hour
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:42:24] <tyche>	Arizona LoCo Team is obvious from the URL and the Logo
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:42:33] <soldats>	yea tyche
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:42:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: yes, but this is an installfest and we want az people coming to the channel and joining the team
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:42:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	if at all possible
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:43:09] <tyche>	That's why the URL at the bottom of the page, along with the chat channel.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:43:17] <soldats>	just remember we are supporting both our team and ubuntu as a whole
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:43:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	yes
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:43:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	we aren't trying to take away from that
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:43:36] <tyche>	We represent Ubuntu as a whole, for this area
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:43:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	only add to our ranks
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:43:44] <soldats>	the contact for out team especially is great
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:45:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: how's it going hee hee
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:45:56] <tyche>	I've still got Firefox in, because I haven't got a list of programs to go in that area
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:46:12] <enigmastrat>	john, did you get my e-mail about the installfest location?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:46:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	enigmastrat: i did
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:46:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	ty
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:46:34] <tyche>	there's firefox, transmission, vinatre,  brasero, world clock
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:46:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'll send an answer to you tomorrow  ok?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:46:58] <enigmastrat>	ok
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:47:02] <tyche>	We could even add wubi in there
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:47:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	what's vinatre
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:47:16] <tyche>	Vinagre VNC client – Remote desktop viewer.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:47:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:47:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	new name
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:47:32] <soldats>	but if we dont support wubi locally i wouldnt add it
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:47:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	i like ssh better
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:47:52] <ianmcorvidae>	most people don't use command line, though
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:47:56] <ianmcorvidae>	so ssh is a bit hard to explain
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:08] <kennymc0>	that's true
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:14] <ianmcorvidae>	and why transmission? is that coming default with the new version?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	true but i had all kinds of problems with vnc
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:22] <soldats>	yea we want to show the "main" apps people coming from windows use
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:29] <soldats>	but linux versions
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:32] Quit	rich1 has left this server ("Lost terminal").
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:33] <tyche>	Transmission is coming default
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:37] <ianmcorvidae>	ah
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: evolution email
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:44] <paul928>	what is "wubi" , the ubuntu package search doesn't even show it?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:44] <ianmcorvidae>	shame, there are much better BT clients
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:45] <ianmcorvidae>	but yeah
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:48:51] <ianmcorvidae>	paul928: windows ubuntu installer
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:49:00] <ianmcorvidae>	allows you to install ubuntu within windows using emulation
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:49:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	wubi allows you to install ubuntu within windows
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:49:24] <paul928>	oh, I thought "wubi on wails"
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:49:28] <ianmcorvidae>	firefox, evolution, openoffice definitely need to be mentioned
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:49:31] <ianmcorvidae>	haha, paul
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:49:42] <soldats>	you got it^^
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:49:42] <ianmcorvidae>	since the major uses of computers are internet, email, and word processing
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:49:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	openoffice yes
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:49:53] <ianmcorvidae>	beyond that, it gets somewhat iffy
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:50:13] <ianmcorvidae>	mentioning games might be good, since the default install is much more game-heavy than windows or mac
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:50:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe just "much, much more"
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:50:20] <soldats>	an aim client deffinitely
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:50:33] <soldats>	majority of win users us aim
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:50:39] <soldats>	s/us/use
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:50:46] <ianmcorvidae>	oh yeah
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:50:51] <soldats>	pidgin
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:50:52] <ianmcorvidae>	pidgin should definitely be mentioned
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:06] <ianmcorvidae>	oo.o, firefox, evolution, pidgin, games
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:07] <kennymc0>	i agree
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: type faster  hee hee
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:26] <soldats>	just dont say its multiprotocol
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	jk
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:40] <paul928>	for me the most important is "free". No cost, virus-free, spy-ware free
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:43] <soldats>	or maybe say it but specifically mention AIM
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:45] <ianmcorvidae>	rhythmbox might be nice
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:47] <ianmcorvidae>	yeah, true
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:51:54] <ianmcorvidae>	just say "IM"
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:52:03] <ianmcorvidae>	don't mention anything that specific; it's not like we have that much space :)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:52:05] <kennymc0>	yeah that would probably be better
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:52:05] <soldats>	yes rhythmbox
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:52:10] <tyche>	"Ubuntu is, and always will be, including all updates, completely free. Free to use, free to share, free to do whatever you want with it."
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:52:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	security in column two covers the virus and spy ware
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:52:39] <ianmcorvidae>	yeah, security as one heading is a good idea
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:52:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	good
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:53:04] <ianmcorvidae>	mentioning disk defragmentation (ie you don't have to) in that area might be nice too, although it's not technically security
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:53:10] <ianmcorvidae>	just as a short note
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:53:12] <tyche>	What I've got right now is:  Firefox 3, Transmission, Vinagre,  Brasero, World Clock, OpenOffice.org, Evolution, Pidgin IM, and Games
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:53:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:53:25] <ianmcorvidae>	tyche: add Rhythmbox
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:53:38] <soldats>	most users dont even defrag unless they know they should do it
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:53:46] <tyche>	OK
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:53:56] <ianmcorvidae>	well, we're most likely to catch the attention of more experienced users :)
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:53:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, do we need a (torrent client) after brasero and some of the others
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:08] <soldats>	true ian
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:08] <ianmcorvidae>	johnc4510-laptop: Transmission is a torrent client
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	that windows people wouldn't recognize
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:21] <tyche>	Transmission is the torrent client
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:30] <kennymc0>	yeah
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:30] <ianmcorvidae>	Brasero is CD burning, no?
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	i thought brasero was
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:36] <tyche>	Yes
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	my bad
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:50] <ianmcorvidae>	I'm not sure Transmission is a good note to put there
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:54] <kennymc0>	or we could even just mention what it is able to do and not mention all the program names because that might confuse people
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:54:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	my point is, windows people won't know what those are
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:55:03] <ianmcorvidae>	because many, many people, even experienced users, are not familiar with torrents
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:55:20] <ianmcorvidae>	kennymc0: yeah, a focus on what can be DONE would be best, probably
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:55:21] <paul928>	why confuse people with the names of apps? just mention what they do.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:55:33] <ianmcorvidae>	perhaps put the names of the apps in parentheses, but other than that
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:55:34] <tyche>	Yes, and there are a lot of college kids that DO know what torrents are.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:55:50] <ianmcorvidae>	I suppose
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:55:55] <tyche>	We're trying to keep the size of the text down.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:55:59] <soldats>	yes but azureus work in ubuntu as well
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:56:04] <paul928>	example: "ubuntu comes with a bittorrent client"
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:56:13] <ianmcorvidae>	there are negative connotations to 'torrent' as well, is most of my concern
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:56:30] <soldats>	true
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:56:48] <ianmcorvidae>	while it's quite legal and used for all sorts of good stuff, directly advertising bittorrent capability might throw triggers for people that haven't heard about it outside of the 'oh noes illegal file sharing' context
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:56:50] <kennymc0>	we could just leave it out and concentrate on other things
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:56:56] <ianmcorvidae>	exactly, kenny
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:57:19] <ianmcorvidae>	I think we should probably have a more comprehensive online list somewhere anyway
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:57:22] <ianmcorvidae>	and link to that
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:57:35] <ianmcorvidae>	the flyer should really only be there to pique the interest of whoever picks it up
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:57:39] <ianmcorvidae>	rather than inform them completely
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:57:52] <ianmcorvidae>	simply because of space concerns, anything other than that would be completely impractical
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:58:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	we could say "all the basic programs to get you started and thousands of other programs available for installation at no cost"
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:58:13] <ianmcorvidae>	that would be good, yes
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:58:21] <kennymc0>	that would work
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:58:21] <tyche>	OK, how about:  Web browser, email client, remote desktop app, CD/DVD burning app, office productivity suite, instant messenger, audio player and games.
[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:58:38] <paul928>	very good, Tyche

[Sun Mar 2 2008] [21:59:19] <ianmcorvidae>	some of the terms might be made more specific (e.g. 'instant messaging client' rather than 'instant messenger') but that's a deal for later :)
