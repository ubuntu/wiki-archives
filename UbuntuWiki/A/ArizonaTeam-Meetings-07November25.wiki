[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:09:40] <johnc4510>	enigmastrat: what are you thoughts about what i added?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:09:45] <mindrape>	nice... I also work in North Phoenix and am often in Ahwatukee and the Easy Valley (Mesa/Gilbert/Queen Creek) visiting family and friends.

[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:10:12] <johnc4510>	mindrape: cool
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:10:31] <enigmastrat>	so... content is just fine
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:10:38] <johnc4510>	mindrape: our new server is what we are discussing: http://ubuntuaz.selfip.com/
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:10:54] <johnc4510>	enigmastrat: any ideas on further content?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:11:20] <enigmastrat>	hmmm... I'm not the content go to guy, but any and all info is good
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:11:38] <johnc4510>	kk
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:11:40] Join	Theou has joined this channel (n=Mark@ip68-2-98-154.ph.ph.cox.net).
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:11:57] <johnc4510>	i was wondering if we should add some web buttons
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:12:02] <tyche>	johnc4510: I know we aren't on track for being a recognized Team, yet, but what else do we need to do?  Should that be listed on the page?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:12:13] <johnc4510>	like: spread firefox and thunderbird
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:12:15] <johnc4510>	etc
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:12:34] <enigmastrat>	ahh
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:12:37] <johnc4510>	tyche: not on that page
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:12:40] <johnc4510>	but
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:12:47] <enigmastrat>	I just deleted my question because you answered it
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:12:54] <enigmastrat>	that would be great
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:13:03] <johnc4510>	i had already planned to start bringing the wiki up to date this next wk
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:13:41] <tyche>	I just thought that it would be a bit of a reminder to the team of where we are, and where we need to go.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:14:10] <johnc4510>	kk, I'm not against it
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:14:30] <tyche>	After all, web pages aren't cast in concrete.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:14:41] <enigmastrat>	I guess it comes down to what we want the purpose of this page to be
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:14:46] <tyche>	(Though I've seen some that should be sunk with concrete.  Hee hee)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:14:52] <johnc4510>	how about once i get the wiki page straightened out we link to it from the server page?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:14:56] <enigmastrat>	it can point to the wiki for team info
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:15:03] <tyche>	I see it as an introduction to the Team.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:15:37] <johnc4510>	and with the link an explanation of the purpose of team approval
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:15:38] <johnc4510>	?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:15:53] <tyche>	Yea, that would be good, too
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:16:19] <johnc4510>	it would be like another paragraph below what we have, with a link
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:16:20] <johnc4510>	?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:16:42] <tyche>	Paragraph, or just lines with check boxes showing what's done.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:16:55] <johnc4510>	kk, that's a thought too
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:16:56] <johnc4510>	:)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:16:58] <johnc4510>	ty
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:17:03] <tyche>	NP
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:17:33] <johnc4510>	tyche: what are your thoughts about the web buttons i mentioned above?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:17:52] <johnc4510>	there are all kinds of them out there
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:18:16] <johnc4510>	gnome, firefox, thunderbird, etc
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:18:22] <johnc4510>	xfce
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:18:22] <enigmastrat>	apache
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:18:26] <johnc4510>	sure
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:18:38] <tyche>	(Why do I get the feeling that I just got myself another job?  LOL)  That's not bad, either.  Also OO.o.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:18:54] <johnc4510>	nope on the extra work
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:18:55] <johnc4510>	:)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:19:18] <johnc4510>	slofgren or myself can handle that
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:19:27] <tyche>	Like, "Try it, you'll like it!"
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:19:28] <mindrape>	lol... why do I feel this girl I made out with for 3 hours last night isn't returning my calls and hates me?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:19:48] <tyche>	mindrape: techique
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:19:54] <tyche>	Hee hee
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:20:14] <mindrape>	seriously... my game is seriously lacking.  I can easily get a first, second, and third date... hitting the nani just is not in my bag of tricks.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:20:22] <johnc4510>	http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:20:35] <johnc4510>	they have a few there to give you an idea
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:20:58] <johnc4510>	image links
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:21:21] <enigmastrat>	those are good to have
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:21:23] <johnc4510>	they give the page some peezaz i think
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:21:27] <tyche>	Image links are good.  You need to keep the graphics the same size, relative to eachother.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:21:42] <johnc4510>	we can gimp them
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:21:53] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:22:13] <enigmastrat>	I especially want the Ohio Linuxfest on our page
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:22:15] <tyche>	If you're going that route, you could add the Ubuntu one(s) too.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:22:49] <tyche>	I see Ohio is behind the times. (Oh, shoot!  Vorian isn't in channel tonight.  hee hee)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:22:51] <johnc4510>	enigmastrat: you and me both, i've had some ideas on an AZ LinuxFest for the future :)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:23:05] <johnc4510>	tyche: :)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:23:50] <johnc4510>	kk, any other ideas
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:23:51] <johnc4510>	?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:24:12] <enigmastrat>	I think we're on the right track
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:24:32] <johnc4510>	kk, then on to the ed team: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Education
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:24:37] <johnc4510>	now
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:25:13] <johnc4510>	tyche and I didn't do anything this wk, because we about killed ourselves last wk getting some of it up to date
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:25:17] <johnc4510>	:)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:25:20] <johnc4510>	but
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:25:40] <johnc4510>	we still need to do something about the email support we discussed
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:25:55] <johnc4510>	we had talked about gmail
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:25:56] <johnc4510>	and
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:26:01] <johnc4510>	the team mailing list
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:26:17] <tyche>	johnc4510: How do other teams handle it?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:26:25] <johnc4510>	hmmmm
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:26:45] <johnc4510>	we should check out ohio, they have a support deal going
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:26:57] <johnc4510>	let me look for the page real quick
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:27:00] <tyche>	maybe some of the others, too.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:27:17] <enigmastrat>	man, you and I are on the same wavelength tonight john
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:27:35] <jsonder>	not reinventing the whell sounds good
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:27:44] <tyche>	You bet
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:27:50] <johnc4510>	http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/locosupport/add
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:28:10] <tyche>	They've got a call back system
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:28:36] <johnc4510>	i just invited vorian
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:28:39] <johnc4510>	to channel
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:28:57] Join	vorian has joined this channel (n=vorian@ubuntu/member/pdpc.supporter.active.Vorian).
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:29:03] <johnc4510>	hey hey
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:29:06] <vorian>	hello
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:29:07] <vorian>	:)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:29:21] <johnc4510>	vorian: how does your team handle the support
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:29:24] <johnc4510>	email wise
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:29:33] <vorian>	via mailing list
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:29:36] <johnc4510>	i know you use phone support
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:30:00] <johnc4510>	so this:http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/locosupport/add is tied into team mail list?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:30:01] <vorian>	no one ever submits request for help, so it's kind of hard to know really :)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:30:10] <johnc4510>	ah
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:30:30] <vorian>	we did have a team set up to channel the requests
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:30:56] <johnc4510>	so, why no requests do you think?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:31:01] <vorian>	but with a lack of support requests, the idea has really lost focus
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:31:10] <vorian>	hmm
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:31:17] <tyche>	How about other teams?  Do they have the same lack of requests?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:31:19] <johnc4510>	exposure?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:31:28] <vorian>	at the end of the day, people don't want to be blabbing on the phone
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:31:37] <johnc4510>	ah
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:31:47] <vorian>	tyche: jacob from our team wrote that module for our site
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:31:48] <enigmastrat>	what if you speak in an indian accent?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:31:53] <johnc4510>	would straight email be better vorian ?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:32:01] <vorian>	then that's extra $$ enigmastrat
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:32:10] <vorian>	yeah, mailing list
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:32:12] <vorian>	irc
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:32:12] <johnc4510>	:)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:32:13] <tyche>	johnc4510: We may be over-working this then.  Maybe what we need to do is just direct them to the forums.
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:32:30] <johnc4510>	or use it for in house direction
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:32:35] <johnc4510>	in team that is
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:33:01] <johnc4510>	vorian: does KY have a support arm of their team? if you know
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:33:22] <vorian>	no idea
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:33:24] <vorian>	sorry
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:33:36] <johnc4510>	kk ty for your knowledge :)
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:33:48] <tyche>	Yes, thanks for your help
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:34:20] 	 * johnc4510 ok, well i see nothing wrong with providing some team support for new members with this do you?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:34:46] Join	rrbiz has joined this channel (n=Miranda@ip68-228-44-25.tc.ph.cox.net).
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:34:54] <johnc4510>	but maybe pull back a bit on the original idea
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:34:55] <johnc4510>	?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:34:57] <johnc4510>	tyche: ?
[Sun Nov 25 2007] [21:35:15] <tyche>	Team members can always jump on IRC and get us.  It was outsiders that I was originally thinking about.  But it looks like I was looking for something that isn't there.
