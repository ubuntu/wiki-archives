__TOC__

== Ubuntu 6.04 Dapper Drake (testing) ==
Ethernet, USB, SATA controllers, IDE controllers and onboard video all work. Sound does not work after installation but perhaps this will change by the time Dapper is released.

=== Installation ===
"noapic" and "nolapic" boot parameters may be required at the start of installation.

== Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy Badger ==
Ethernet, USB, SATA controllers, IDE controllers and onboard video all work. The NVIDIA proprietary and xorg "nv" drivers in Breezy do not support the onboard video adapter. Ubuntu uses "nv" after a defaualt installation. The video driver must be chagned to "vesa" in xorg.conf in order for X to start.

=== Installation ===
Use noapic and nolapic boot parameters at start of installation. e.g.:
linux noapic nolapic

After the installer reboots and X fails to start, switch over to a virtual terminal, log-in and edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the video driver to "vesa". Then restart gdm (sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart).
