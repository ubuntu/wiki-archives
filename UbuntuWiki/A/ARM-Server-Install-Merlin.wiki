== Ubuntu 14.04 Installation Instructions ==
Since X-C1 SDP's are UEFI based, they can be installed using the same instructions as a typical UEFI server.  Please refer to  <nowiki>[[ARM-Server-Install-UEFI-ARM]]</nowiki> for further details, with the one caveat that the 14.04 installer can be found <nowiki>[[http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/dists/trusty-updates/main/installer-arm64/current/images/xenial-generic/netboot/netboot.tar.gz|here]]</nowiki>, otherwise the instructions are the same.
