=== Introduction ===

 I am a network administrator at Curves International, a fitness franchise for women based out of Waco, TX.  Curves is currently in over 50 countries, and the largest fitness franchise in the world.  I work mainly on Windows 2003 servers, but my passion is Ubuntu Linux.  We are currently in the process of virtualizing a large portion of our servers.  I have a degree from the University of Texas at Arlington in Information Systems and Management Science.  I have been using Linux on and off since 1998 when I was in school, but currently have been running Ubuntu on my home computer for over a year.

=== Current Projects ===

* Testing and documenting ''UFW'' Ubuntu Firewall
* Brasero documentation
