== SimpleFlatWindow ==

Since the beginning of Ubuntu I was a sucker for its chromatic and tried to find out a simpler way to put all the needs of a user at a handy touch. 

=== Concept ===
This mocup was inspired to me by a world wide known software producer (I don't want to make an add here) and thought it is very useful and practical. Yes, I have made the mocup on the Human Theme! Well, I did it because I like it very much.

Please don't mind the Wallpaper!

=== What's the difference? ===
1. The Window Menu an the Title Bar has been merged for more work space in the window.
2. I took the right to make small changes to buttons, combos, and so on.
3. No more Window Title, which I think is useful only for those whom might work in development and media, any way we recognize a window by its Icon or by its content. ( I might be wrong here, so, yes criticize me) 
n. that's all...

* There has to be another way to present a window's Title to the user..  The titlebars that we have today are very cluttered, in my opinion.  It takes up a lot of space and does very little for the user.  What if we had little tabs connected to different windows that auto-hide in the top corners of the windows?  You can just hover in that area to see it, or when a person clicks on a window from another window the title tab pops out quickly to let them know..  Personally, I just think there are better ways to display that information to the user..  Anyone else have any ideas? -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:bradwjensen]]</nowiki>

* Some thoughts on the window title thing: many applications use the document title as the primary part of the window title (this is also recommended by the Gnome HIG).  This offers a bit more information than the icon alone.  You should take this into consideration when considering removing the window title completely. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:m-mckinley]]</nowiki> 
* very nice mockup, I always thought that the text on the base surfaces should be engraved like you imagined here. its so basic.. About the titles: they should be on the left side fading into the title color at the right side if they are too long. should work well and looks nice. Gusztee

* This needs more love <3 Very pleasing design to the eye, bigger and clearer, just a good use of space.  My only concern is a program like Maya with two-dozen menus would fill the titlebar and make it hard to move the window.  I guess if we disable the left-click for the menu icon and drag the window around by the newly large top left corner that would be OK (the 1% who actually use that icon could still right-click).
