=== About me ===
Hi, all. My name is Andre Ardiantoro Muliana, I use nick ''a2xm'' on the net. I live in Jakarta, Indonesia. My history encounter with Linux was started around September 2004. I try installing borrowed CDs of Mandrake from my friend. Use it for 1 week and I decided to buy SuSE 9.1 Prof. So, I use SuSE for afew months then. It was not easy to learn Linux in a short time.

One day I read a blog mentioning about Ubuntu. I checked it on <nowiki>[[http://distrowatch.com|DistroWatch]]</nowiki> and it rank #1. Without wasting more time I order it right away. My free CDs of Ubuntu 5.04 (The Hoary Hedgehog) arrived around September/October 2005, but I just installed & started using it on November 27, 2005. I've reinstall it again to Breezy Badger on December 7, 2005. Since then I love Ubuntu so much. ;-)
