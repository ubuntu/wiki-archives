Hi
This is a really great idea and I think this could be a very stylish look for Ubuntu. I really hope that this idea makes it into the next Ubuntu version - although it properly requires a lot of work. I've just made this image showing one of the possibilities with this great idea.

* I think this a really good idea! Beautifull, small and pretty for the eye!

* This makes me think: why do we need all Ubuntu UI elements to look computer-generated? Why not some flourishes such as the splash screen featuring well-done but intimate hand-animated artwork? It would give a very unique feel and could be quite pleasing if done right. -Sumit, 2008|01|30
