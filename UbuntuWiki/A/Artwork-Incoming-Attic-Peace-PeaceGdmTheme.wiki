'''The Peace GDM theme'''

== Concept ==
A well made face chooser for the login screen.  Should be striking but have a very peaceful nature about it.  Scrolling may be enabled but only when necessary and most options should be visible, albeit without a cluttered design.
== Screenshots ==

== Working files ==
This version is based on Tobias Oelgarte's fine GDM named Avio.  Looks nice and works great so quite a stepping stone.
