__TOC__

* specification of the board: see ASUS home page

== soft factors ==
* it looks really nice with the passive cooling stuff
* it is really good managing the noise level depending on the CPU load (good for living rooms and MythTV boxes)

== installation ==
* installed Ubuntu 7.06 on
** 2 hard drives with a Linux SW RAID1 root partition to keep it fast and secure against failure, and another RAID0 partition with huge space for the movies we record using MythTV
** AMD 64x2 processor
** 2GB RAM
** 'old' analog TV card
** 2 graphic cards (Nvidia, cheepest I could find) to support
** 1 projector for MythTV viewing
** 1-2 screens for desktop work
* then upgraded to Ubuntu 7.10

== performance ==
* when coming from an AMD64 machine from shelf (HP), this is a real runner
* the 2 cores of the AMD64x2 make the system really nice to handle, you nearly never wait for anything
* the harddrives are much faster than in my old board (HP destop PC for home use)
* MythTV consumes 10-15% CPU load => plenty of room for work on the desktop screen while rest of the family watches TV

== problems ==
* AUDIO: 
** the HD audio chipset gives problems
** It seems like it is not fully supported by the kernel
** I need to connect the TV card to the microphone input of the board, because I cannot get good audio levels with the on-board connector for CD audio
** it is simply not possible to listen to an audio input source other than PCM.
** this is no problem with MythTV, as this setup always first records from an input and plays sound via PCM => works
** this is no problem for playing MP3, ogg, radio, etc. because all of these use PCM
** this is no problem for wathching DVDs or internet video clips/shows/TV because the movie players use PCM
** this is a problem if you want to do pre-listening to your recordings
** this is a problem if you want to use a standard TV application to watch TV with your TV card: then you need to connect your loudspeakers/amplifier directly to the TV card instead of the mixer output of the motherboard.
** however, the board produces low-noise fine sound when playing PCM

== Overall ==
* this is the best desktop Linux setup i ever run
* the price of the board is really ok for the quality and performance you get (even w/o overclocking)
* i feel that the HD controller is really faster than the normal controllers used by cheaper chipsets
* i do not test it with games, etc., mostly with desktop and multimedia applications
