 04:08 <MajB> LINUX QUOTES AND JOKES:

 04:08 <MajB> â€œUbuntu sucksâ€  A quote from a gentleman at the West End Fair 6 May 2017 in Sierra Vista AZ.

 04:08 <MajB> When asked why, he replied that he couldnâ€™t get his Epson Scanner to work in Ubuntu.

 04:09 <MajB> When offered assistance, he declined saying â€œI spent enough time on it and I will not spend another second.â€

 04:09 <MajB> When he was told that we would get his scanner to work for free if he would bring it to one of our meetings, he flatly walked away.  Interesting.
