I want to remind everyone to register at the Ubuntu-us-az mailing list here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-az Within the next two weeks, we will be using this list exclusively to send out the newsletter and other loco announcements. So, please register to stay up to date on breaking loco news.

The Ubuntu Weekly News interviewed ianmcorvidae and myself, and included a one paragraph article on our loco in it's current edition which can be found here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue40 I encourage all members to read this article and subscribe to the Ubuntu Weekly News. You can sign up for it by visiting the above mentioned link. I also wish to thank boredandblogging for his time and consideration in writing about our loco. And as usual, Vorian aka Steve Stalecup for suggesting it to him. Thanks again Vorian.

We have a new sticky on the forum here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=443860 It has lots of links and info. Please review and make any suggestions as to improving it.

We have a new irc stat page for our channel, courtesy of our resident guru ianmcorvidae. You can access it here: http://ubuntuarizonairc.thruhere.net  Ian has done a great job setting this page up for us and I think you will find it not only useful, but also attractive and humorous. Thanks Ian.

Last meeting was on Mother's Day, and I wasn't expecting very many to show up. I was once again proven wrong as so often happens.:) We had 13 in attendance, and the meeting was productive. I want to thank everyone for keeping to the topics and showing courtesy by letting the team leaders present their summaries without interruption. Thanks

I know that I've already made quite a few announcements here, but I have one more. Some of the Tucson members met at a local coffee shop for a get to know each other meeting. We had a good time, and it was nice to finally put a face to a name. We took a group picture and have added a photo page to the wiki here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Photos I encourage you to visit the page so you can also put a face with a name. We will add to this as time goes by and more people decide to get together.

Summary of Last Meeting
May 13th, 2007

Introductions were made and we welcomed bluecat9, flux_, chucks_ and etank. etank is a member of the Kentucky Loco, and as we are doing, he was visiting other loco teams to get an idea of how they are doing things.

The team reports showed that even though school is winding down and finals being taken, most were still working on something. Ian reported that the Membership Team had discussed and was looking into distributing posters and CD's to coffee shop, libraries and computer shops. He also told us they were looking into having our logo and slogan used on mugs, shirts, license plate holders, etc. to be distributed by CafePress. There was also discussion of having a wiki or forum page devoted to how to become a member of our team. I am very much in favor of this and am looking forward to seeing what the team comes up with.

Most of the Newsletter Team business has been discussed in the announcements above. I would like to point out that br24 has joined the team as a roving reporter. His assignment is to visit a different loco team each week and report on what ideas we might find interesting and useful. This last week his report was on the Colorado Loco and his observations can be found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=437015 Please take a few moments to read and then comment on the thread. br24 is also looking into the possiblity of getting our wiki page translated into Spanish to accommodate future Spanish speakers.

The Wine/VMWare Team has changed directions. It was decided that we would drop the wine portion of the project, but still continue to try to help those who needed it to run certain proprietary software. We will now instead have a Education Team to help educate new users in the installation and configuration of Ubuntu, and other open source applications. The team will also work in conjunction with the Server Team in the implementation and use of VMWare. Please visit their new wiki page here for more information: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Education

DX00 was away on vacation, so the server team was bypassed for this week, but after our meeting I found an email about the meeting he had with DeVry, and there is a link to the presentation that was made under Meeting Summary here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Server
DX00's email also stated that they were working to get the server up and running asap. He also stated that anyone needing an ssh account on the server should get in touch with him and provide a user name and password so he can set it up.

The agenda for the next meeting is posted here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Meetings/07May20

Another great week of work!! Thanks to all!!
