21:35 -!- donchriscoe [n=donchris@cm-24-121-127-157.flagstaff.az.npgco.com] has quit ["Leaving"]
21:35 < yamyogurt> If i was new to computers i wouldent want to stick  shaddy looking cds into my machine
21:35 < Polygon89> wait, can you put labels on any type of cd? like does it have to be a special cd-r that you have to buy?
21:35 < yamyogurt> and i still woudlent
21:35 < Polygon89> cause if so, then we can just burn em on whatever and then get ppl with cd labelers..
21:35 < johnc4510> Polygon89: paper labels you can put on any cd
21:35 < johnc4510> takes a special one for scribing
21:36 < word> Polygon89: nope, unless they spent extra to make the surface of it uber slick...which would make it retarded+1...but they dont'...so the answer is still no any cd will work.
21:36 < johnc4510> yep
21:36 < Polygon89> ok.
21:36 < Polygon89> hmm lightscribe cds might be interestering
21:36 < Polygon89> those are actually pretty cool.
21:36 < da> paper cd covers when?
21:36 < Polygon89> and dont require ink or anything.
21:36 < johnc4510> Polygon89: we are designing a sleeve to make them look better
21:36 < johnc4510> hang on for link
21:37 -!- mesapiegrande [n=matthew@ip68-109-129-91.ph.ph.cox.net] has quit ["Leaving"]
21:37 < Polygon89> ok
21:37 < word> just like..scan the ubuntu labels that you can get in the mail from ubuntu, crop it and get a thing of cd labels, they're reg. print pages prob like 4 labels to a sheet :-/
21:37 < johnc4510> Polygon89: about the 3rd link down here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=516885
21:37 < johnc4510> SloggerKhan: howdy
21:38 < shaanM> u just missed the meeting
21:38 < johnc4510> yamyogurt: SloggerKhan is here now if you want to talk to him
21:38 < johnc4510> i think it was you
21:38 < johnc4510> ?
21:38 < Polygon89> so is that just a sleeve to put around the cd?
21:38 < Polygon89> not an actual label?
21:38 < SloggerKhan> I had to be at our 'welcome to the dorm, here are the rules talk'
21:38 < johnc4510> Polygon89: right
21:38 < Polygon89> hmm
21:39 < Polygon89> i wonder if i can print paper cd labels from my printer
21:39 < yamyogurt> SloggerKhan: I just wanted to make a sugestion for the flyers
21:39 < Polygon89> i probley just have to buy special paper.
21:39 < SloggerKhan> Oh, good.
21:39 < johnc4510> Polygon89: have you ordered from shipit ever
21:39 < johnc4510> ?
21:39 < Polygon89> no.
21:39 < Polygon89> but i know what they look like
21:39 < SloggerKhan> yamyogurt: I've been wanting some
21:39 < johnc4510> Polygon89: it's a pretty nice little set up
21:39 < johnc4510> and you don't have to buy jewel cases then
21:39 < SloggerKhan> At my job we have an inkjet you can put CDs in.
21:40 < Polygon89> but that requires special cd's.
21:40 < SloggerKhan> yeah
21:40 < Polygon89> and even then i hear that the labels like smear off
21:40 < word> Polygon89: with some work you could prob set openoffice up to do the format of the label sheets
21:40 < johnc4510> Polygon89: yep on smearing
21:40 < yamyogurt> SloggerKhan: have yo decided to go with http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=40618&d=1187067349
21:40 < Polygon89> lol
21:40 < Polygon89> i think paper sticky labels would be the best...
21:41 < Polygon89> im sure you can buy paper at like office max for that..
21:41 < word> or staples
21:41 -!- shaanM [n=shaan@ip68-110-108-148.ph.ph.cox.net] has quit ["Ex-Chat"]
21:41 < Polygon89> i dont think we even have a staples in tucson, or i havent seen one.
21:41 < SloggerKhan> If people like it, it can be it. If you guys want changes there can be changes.
21:41 < johnc4510> yamyogurt: if you have ideas   voice them please
21:41 < johnc4510> on flyer
21:42 < word> i stole some paper that you can print stuff on and then iron on to a tshirt with from my cousins house..i'm watching their dog while they're on vacation..but it costs more in gas to go there than they're paying me...so fair's fair ;p
21:42 < yamyogurt> SloggerKhan: I would suggest they you mae it less wordy and even though its pretty straight forward i would remove terms like live cd becasue for a person new to computer it might be confusing
21:42 < SloggerKhan> hmm.
21:43 < johnc4510> yamyogurt: well, live cd is a real selling point for them trying it out
21:43 < yamyogurt> I don't know your intended audience though
21:43 < johnc4510> without installing on their computer
21:43 < yamyogurt> SloggerKhan: you can change the wording
21:43 < SloggerKhan> I'll tell you what? If you give me your text/bullets of choice, I can make another version at some point in the next couple of weeks.
21:43 < SloggerKhan> silverstar@bluebottle.com
21:43 < johnc4510> yamyogurt: people that have never used open source at all
21:43 < word> a quick explanation when handing it to them and a definition on the back would suffice probably :-/
21:44 < Polygon89> so i guess ill sign up for making cds
21:44 < Polygon89> and ill research about paper sticky labels
21:44 < SloggerKhan> I'm working on a backside to the graphics one.
21:44 < johnc4510> Polygon89: thanks!!!!!
21:44 < yamyogurt> SloggerKhan: hmmm
21:44 < Polygon89> and also
21:45 < Polygon89> you guys think we will need kubuntu / xubuntu?
21:45 < Polygon89> if so how much compared to ubuntu..
21:45 < SloggerKhan> http://www.cafepress.com/slogger  ( I am evil and wanted my own shirt with a possibly non-kosher design)
21:45 < word> kubuntu ftw ;p
21:45 < johnc4510> Polygon89: you can do a few if you want, but stick to ubuntu/kubuntu mostly please
21:46 < Polygon89> are we allowed to put
21:46 < Polygon89> the ubuntu logo on cafepress shirts?  i know they have stingy rules on copyright
21:46 < SloggerKhan> I am *probably* breaking rules
21:46 < johnc4510> Polygon89: you talking about just the ubuntu logo?
21:46 < word> if you are going to be giving them to people that you know regarding their comp specs, then make up some xubuntu cd's as well
21:46 < SloggerKhan> *shrugs*
21:46 < Polygon89> yeah..
21:46 < yamyogurt> SloggerKhan: NVM
21:46 < johnc4510> Polygon89: i am working on something like that now
21:47 < johnc4510> hang on for link
21:47 < Polygon89> and when i click see larger product
21:47 < Polygon89> it says product not found slogger
21:47 < Polygon89> but thats a cool design..
21:47 < SloggerKhan> I might have made it so that only I can get them.
21:47 < word> "Not too tight, not too loose." lol
21:48 < Polygon89> what does the text say on the shrit?
21:48 < johnc4510> Polygon89: i'm working on this for all US loco teams for ubuntu logo only  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=529667
21:48 < Polygon89> shirt?
21:48 < SloggerKhan> It's just our wiki page
21:48 < yamyogurt> SloggerKhan: my last sugestion is to use the ubuntu logo color scheme
21:48 < SloggerKhan> Ok.
21:48 < Polygon89> lol lands end
21:48 < Polygon89> i get some stuff from em :D
21:48 < johnc4510> shirts, polos, laptop cases, throws etc
21:48 < Polygon89> id just want a shirt if anything...
21:48 < Polygon89> but yea i like it.
21:49 < yamyogurt> SloggerKhan: although a person new to ubuntu wont know the diffrence
21:49 < SloggerKhan> I used what I did because I figured it would be OK in grayscale.
21:49 < johnc4510> Polygon89: be sure to vote, yea or nay on the idea
21:49 < yamyogurt> i see
21:49 < Polygon89> lol@ 35 to 1 in the poll.
21:49 < SloggerKhan> But yeah, if you send me the text you want, I can make another flyer version.
21:49 < johnc4510> Polygon89: i can't figure who voted no
21:49 < johnc4510> lol
21:49 < SloggerKhan> And use the official Ubuntu color pallete
