__TOC__

For Feisty, I envision pushing the Edgy theme further; improving on bits, and tweaking others to fit better together.

Here is a list of things that I would like to see changed in Feisty:

* Improve Usplash progress bar
* Improve on the menu icon in KDM if time allows
* Tweak window decoration background gradients
* Tweak wallpaper
* Tweak color scheme (done, testing)
* Use different widget style (done, testing)

In addition there is work on a new logout dialog (link needed). For this we need several new icons for suspend, hibernate, restart, and shutdown.

If you know of something else that could be improved or are interested in helping on any of these points feel free to ping me in irc or send a mail to the artwork list or myself. -- KennethWimer
