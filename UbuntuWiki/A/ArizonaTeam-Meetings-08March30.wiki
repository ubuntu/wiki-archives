[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:05:44] <tyche>	Actually, it sounds like a good idea.  Family atmosphere (Noisy kids), pizza, soft drinks, etc.

[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:11:17] <johnc4510>	we have a problem with pima and a location for tucson
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:11:26] <Wolf_45>	I'll have to check it when I've got a better connection.
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:11:27] <johnc4510>	they won't commit
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:11:42] <soldats>	hmm that sucks
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:11:55] <soldats>	the building i could have gotten doesnt have internet
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:11:58] <johnc4510>	so, we need an alternate plan    and pretty quickly
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:12:17] <johnc4510>	hmm
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:12:39] <johnc4510>	soldats: any ideas?
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:12:50] <johnc4510>	or anyone else
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:12:51] <johnc4510>	?
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:13:24] <johnc4510>	we could maybe try bookmans
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:13:27] <soldats>	no, but ill still ponder on it
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:13:46] <johnc4510>	the problem there is it's total wireless
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:13:50] <johnc4510>	i think
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:13:56] <soldats>	bookmans may work but which one and is there space there
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:14:17] <johnc4510>	the one out east has a large enough room
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:14:42] <johnc4510>	you could put at least 50 people in it
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:14:54] <johnc4510>	might be a little tight but
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:14:56] <johnc4510>	you could
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:15:05] <soldats>	that could work but only wireless would suck
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:15:13] <Wolf_45>	Bookmans is possible, depending on "which one"....I've needed a good excuse to get back to the one on Grant & Campbell!
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:15:38] <johnc4510>	i don't know how big a room they have at that location
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:01] <johnc4510>	Wolf_45: if you could maybe check it out i would appreciate it
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:01] <johnc4510>	?
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:31] <ianmcorvidae>	it's reasonably sized
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:34] <Wolf_45>	I guess that means I'll need to spend a lot of time checking it out then?  ;-)
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:35] <johnc4510>	kk
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:35] <ianmcorvidae>	it has about 24 plugs
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:49] <johnc4510>	elec or internet ianmcorvidae
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:52] <ianmcorvidae>	we've had 20+ people in there comfortably watching a movie at one point
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:54] <ianmcorvidae>	electric
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:56] <ianmcorvidae>	there's wireless
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:16:58] <johnc4510>	k
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:17:06] <ianmcorvidae>	don't know if there's cable, but I doubt it
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:17:14] <johnc4510>	me too
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:17:44] <johnc4510>	i really wish we could do it at the U of A
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:17:47] <Wolf_45>	ianmcorvidae, what about the Greek Orthodox church on Ft Lowell?
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:17:52] <johnc4510>	that would be really nice
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:18:03] <ianmcorvidae>	I don't really know much about that church, but I suspect it would work
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:18:09] <johnc4510>	Wolf_45: i know that church
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:18:20] <johnc4510>	went to a funeral there once
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:18:28] Join	jared_ has joined this channel (n=jared@75-167-17-13.phnx.qwest.net).

[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:19:06] <johnc4510>	nice
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:19:30] <jared_>	John, I wonder if you got my email regarding the Ubuntu embroidering idea?
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:19:38] <johnc4510>	jared_: we are having our weekly meeting
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:19:42] <johnc4510>	i did
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:19:43] <johnc4510>	ty
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:19:50] <Wolf_45>	They hold the Greek Fair there every year, I know.  Haven't thought to scope it out for an installfest though.
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:19:52] <johnc4510>	i've been very busy of late
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:20:12] <johnc4510>	Wolf_45: you suppose they have internet?
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:20:21] <paul928>	Wolf_45: do they have cable?
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:20:55] <johnc4510>	ok, let's do this then
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:21:26] <johnc4510>	everyone from tucson, let's spend this next week looking for an alternative location
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:21:36] <soldats>	ok
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:21:36] <johnc4510>	and we can talk during the wk
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:21:53] <Wolf_45>	I don't know, to either question - I guess I'll need to knock on their door and ask.  :-)
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:21:55] <johnc4510>	that would be me, soldats , Wolf_45 , ianmcorvidae
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:22:02] <johnc4510>	Wolf_45: kk
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:22:13] <johnc4510>	did i leave anyone out?
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:22:59] <soldats>	sloggerkhan but hes pretty busy
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:23:19] <johnc4510>	the main thing for this wk then is for the phoenix folks to start passing out the release party flier once we get the location from kenny
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:23:22] <johnc4510>	right
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:23:56] <johnc4510>	and for the tucson folks to secure another location for the installfest and pick out a location for the release party
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:24:04] <tyche>	As soon as I get the information from kenny, I'll post the flier.
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:24:15] <johnc4510>	i don't think the release party location will be a problemm
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:24:18] <johnc4510>	tyche: kk
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:24:37] <tyche>	I also want to check that the jpg will print all right.
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:24:44] <johnc4510>	anything else ??
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:25:08] <johnc4510>	ok, then let's call it a night :)
[Sun Mar 30 2008] [21:25:19] <tyche>	OK.  It's a night.
