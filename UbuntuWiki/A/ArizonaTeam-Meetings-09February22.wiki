21:02 < kennymc0> :P
21:02 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, announcements then
21:02 < johnc4510-laptop> Mark Shuttleworth has announce the code name for Ubuntu 9.10 will be Karmic Koala.
21:02 < scott_ev> wooho
21:02 < johnc4510-laptop> Server: Ubuntu aims to keep free software at the forefront of cloud computing by embracing the API's of Amazon EC2, and making it easy for anybody to setup their own cloud using entirely open tools.
21:02 < johnc4510-laptop> .
21:02 < johnc4510-laptop> Desktop: The desktop will have a designer's fingerprints all over it - we're now beginning the serious push to a new look. Brown has served us well but the Koala is considering other options.
21:02 < kennymc0> cool
21:03 < tyche> 'Bout time
21:03 < johnc4510-laptop> now more brown maybe
21:03 < johnc4510-laptop> yeah
21:03 < johnc4510-laptop> that should make a lot of folks happy
21:03 < johnc4510-laptop> i personally like the brown _some_ of the time
21:03 < johnc4510-laptop> but i change frequently
21:03 < kennymc0> hopefully they dont go with too much black and make it look a lot like vista
21:03 < johnc4510-laptop> so np
21:03 < tyche> Me, I like a nicely roasted sienna
21:03 < kennymc0> that would be bad

21:04 < johnc4510-laptop> Siph0n: agreed

21:07 < kennymc0> couldnt have done it without everyone's help
21:07 < kennymc0> thankyou
21:07 < johnc4510-laptop> Don't forget to take a look at the latest issue of the UWN: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue130
21:07 < kennymc0> :)
21:07 < johnc4510-laptop> great issue this wk.
21:07 < kennymc0> huge issue this week
21:07 < johnc4510-laptop> full of _everything_ ubuntu
21:07 < kennymc0> you were on a roll this week johnc4510-laptop
21:07 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:08 < kennymc0> and so was tyche
21:08 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, we're going to get into the new website shortly but scott_ev wanted a few to talk about bugs i think
21:08 < johnc4510-laptop> scott_ev: your up
21:08 < scott_ev> k
21:08 < scott_ev> thx
21:09 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:09 < scott_ev> after the meeting where kennymc0 got membership, vorian came into our channel
21:09 < scott_ev> he asked if anyone wantee to help ang get started toward membewrship
21:09 < scott_ev> he's a MOTU and works heavily with Kubuntu packaging
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> and use to be our team mentor
21:10 < johnc4510-laptop> once upon a time
21:10 < scott_ev> they are just now really starting to branch Kubuntu bugs away from ubuntu
21:10 < scott_ev> and they need help
21:10 < scott_ev> there's great oportunity in KDE to show skill and a desire to help and get things in order to befome an ubuntu member
21:11 < scott_ev> if you want to know more in detail, get with me after the meeting
21:11 < scott_ev> that's all
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> we've tried to stir up interest in bugs before with no luck...however i would still like to see us get started with the bugjam events
21:11 < kennymc0> that would be cool
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> the biggest problem we have is
21:11 < scott_ev> there's more than bugs
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> we have on one that really knows the ins and outs of bug work
21:11 < johnc4510-laptop> so
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> i'm going to make a suggestion
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> i think if scott_ev would get active in this area, then maybe he could point us in the right direction
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> and
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> maybe we could make a start
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> ?????
21:12 < johnc4510-laptop> thoughts
21:12 < scott_ev> I'll start to post things in the forum
21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, and
21:13 < tyche> There may be other people, in other teams, that could help "mentor" us, too
21:13 < scott_ev> maybe a column on the website
21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> once the website is up we should start using it for that too
21:13 < scott_ev> cool
21:13 < kennymc0> i could probably make a page for it on the website
21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> scott_ev: you'll be able to use the blog page for that i think
21:14 < scott_ev> we need a how=to section, maybe
21:14 < tyche> scott_ev: May I suggest you keep a journal of the sorts of things you learn, as you learn them.  then someone could interview you at a later time and write it up for a blog.
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> if it works out we can talk about an event and a page dedicated to bugs
21:14 < scott_ev> johnc4510-laptop: yep
21:14 < scott_ev> cool
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:14 < Siph0n> scott_ev, I would be interested in doing bug work too. Tho, I use Gnome. I gotta go now tho... I will talk to u about it tomorrow if u are around :)
21:14 < kennymc0> wiki or the team forum is probably the best place for a how-to
21:14 < scott_ev> Siph0n: cool
21:14 -!- Siph0n [n=Siph0n@ip68-99-198-225.ph.ph.cox.net] has quit ["Leaving"]
21:14 < scott_ev> team forum sticky
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> scott_ev: so we seem to have an interest, but we need you to get us started and give us a direction
21:15 < scott_ev> ok, I'll do what I can
21:15 < scott_ev> it will be my focus
21:15 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, that will get you a great start toward membership too
21:15 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:15 < kennymc0> very good start
21:15 < johnc4510-laptop> ok great

21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, on to the website
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> http://12.159.65.82/drupal/
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> we've done some more to complete the site
21:27 < kennymc0> tee hee website
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> i had hoped to have it and live by tonight but..
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren got tied up
21:27 < scott_ev> is he feeling ok?
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> we've rescheduled for monday
21:28 < johnc4510-laptop> scott_ev: yes, family stuff
21:28 < tyche> Yea, he wasn't feeling well, the last I heard
21:28 < johnc4510-laptop> sounded ok when kennymc0 and i talked to him earlier
21:28 < scott_ev> k
21:28 < johnc4510-laptop> just tied up with family
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, i'm looking to see about the blog in several areas
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> 1. we need to get the feed agrigated to the team planet
21:29 < tyche> Kewl!  you got the team logo in the footer.
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> and i think i've got that figured
21:29 < [R]> you know, i've heard about these girls that like geeky guys... i always thought it was a myth... but this girl i'm talking to seems to like it
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche: it's actually embedded at the bottom of ever page
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:30 < tyche> Yea.  It's in the page footer.
21:30 < kennymc0> yeah tyche pay attention
21:30 < kennymc0> lol
21:30 < tyche> I'm Scots.  I don't pay anything.
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche: nope
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> it's at the bottom of every page now
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> footer would look different
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> it would be down in the drupal area at the bottom
21:31 < scott_ev> tyche: took to many headers as a young soft headed child
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> but np
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> 2. i'm looking at how to agrigate members existing blogs to the blog section
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche and i already have wordpress blogs
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> and it would be easier to feed the team blog from those so we don't have to do both, or lose content
21:32 < tyche> Just don't tell slofgren that he has to install and maintain bzr.
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> but migrating to the team blog only
21:32 < [R]> johnc4510-laptop: like planet-style?
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche: i don't think we will
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> [R]: yes
21:33 < tyche> Good.  that thing is a nightmare
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> agreed
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:33 < kennymc0> the agregator module should do what we want
21:33 < kennymc0> just have to figure out how toget it to cooperate and do what we want it to
21:33 < kennymc0> :)
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> kennymc0: ok, if you are free in the morning, let's take a look at that
21:33 < [R]> i wish i had a linux blog... but i don't know what i would write about
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> [R]: you can use the team blog to get you started if you want and then see how it goes
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> maybe branch out later
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> or
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> sometime in the future, we may put wordpress on the server and migrate our blogs to it
21:35 < [R]> oh i could set up my own not a problem... i just don't know what i would write about aside i could maybe post lots from ##linux and berate all the stupid folks
21:35 < [R]> lol
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> ah
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:35 < [R]> i'm a wordpress wizz if you need help on that
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> [R]: great
21:36 < johnc4510-laptop> now, once the site is live, we'll activate everyone who has registered for an account
21:36 < johnc4510-laptop> anyone who is on the team in Launchpad can get an account
21:36 < johnc4510-laptop> next
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> i don't know if we had the google calendar on the site as of the last meeting
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> but we do now
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> and you can add it to your personal google page easily
21:37 < kennymc0> that was something i did either tuesday night or wednesday
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> at the bottom right of the calendar is a "+google calendar" button
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> click on that on it will add our calendar feed to your google personal page
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> ok kennymc0 tyche what have i missed
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> ?
21:39 < tyche> Nothing I can think of.  Except, maybe the poll
21:39 < kennymc0> you havent broken the site since that one time and we are very proud of you :)
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> thx
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, the polls are set up so anyone can vote on them
21:39 < kennymc0> yep
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> registered user or not
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> we want input from anyone visiting the site
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> also
21:40 < tyche> Currently, 60% are in favor of the site, 40% said their current level of inebriation was not adequate for an accurate response.
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> anyone visiting can leave comments on the blog articles or pages or whatever
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> they just can't post anything
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:41 < tyche> I'm not sure whether that meant they weren't drunk enough, or weren't sober enough.
21:41 < kennymc0> only registered users can post without an admin approving the comment
21:41 < kennymc0> exactly tyche
21:41 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, we also installed a module for stats on the site
21:41 < kennymc0> it's perfectly vauge
21:41 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:41 < kennymc0> and purpously vauge as well
21:42 < johnc4510-laptop> only site admins can see the stats, but we'll keep everyone inform
21:42 < johnc4510-laptop> also posting to the front page is somewhat restricted for now
21:42 < kennymc0> only admins can post on the front page
21:42 < johnc4510-laptop> meaning not everyone can post info to it
21:43 < kennymc0> but we can also promote something to the front page
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> we did this to regulated what is on the front page
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> yes
21:43 < scott_ev> the front page should be pretty locked down
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> if you have something you think is front page worthy, you can ask one of us
21:43 < kennymc0> so if you get permision from our benevolent leader we can get your story on the front page
21:43 < tyche> We need a way to let PLUG, and etc., put information on the calendar
