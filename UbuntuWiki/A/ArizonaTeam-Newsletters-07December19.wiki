==== Summary of the December 16, 2007 meeting ====

johnc4510 called the meeting to order at 9:01 PM

There were no new members.

johnc4510 made the following announcements: We have a new team channel if you hadn't noticed. It's #ubuntu-us-az. If you have auto-joined enabled on your chat client, it will bring you here automatically since there is a redirect on the old channel.  This change is due to compliance with the Community Council to make channel names consistent. I have gone through and changed all the links I could find on our server, wiki pages, and forum threads.  If you come across one that I have missed, go ahead and change it, or let myself or tyche know so we can.

Next, with the Holiday Season getting into full swing now, we will still have meetings.  They may be a little bit more informal, but we feel it a good idea to show consistence by continuing at our regular schedule.

I hope you all enjoy the peace of the season, and the blessing of family during this time. Happy Holidays!!

Our first order of business was the Education Team project.  [Ed. note:  This section quoted from the log of the meeting.]  We continue to add applications to the Education Team page, although at a slow pace. SloggerKhan sent in items to add to the Graphics list under the Optional category.  Here is the link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Education/Graphics  you might want to take a look at it at your leisure to see what optional apps you can add to the graphics menu to round out this section of your install.  We still need members to help us add items to the following pages: System Tools, Sound & Video, Programming, and Other.  If you can find time to give us a few minutes it would be appreciated. You can look at any of the other pages to see what we're doing and then just email myself at johnc4510-cox@ubuntu.com or tyche at tyche@cox.net.

The next order of business was the Team server.  enigmastrat reported that the basic design of the page appears to be set.  He had a question about PHP, but in discussion with slofgrin and johnc4510 it was determined that for only a few pages it would not be necessary.  Should the site grow larger other methods, such as PHP or css would be discussed.  A second page was suggested, outlining the Team purpose.  This would have something like why we're doing what we're doing, and how we're doing it.  It was thought that a third page would be to use it to emphasize the lugs of the state.  This page could include links to the lugs and logos for them.  johnc4510 will try to contact the various lugs over the holidays about being included on our page, and offering our support of their organizations.  enigmastrat was asked how long it would take to make 2 more pages, if the format remained the same and only the text changed.  He proceeded to duplicate the main page as two new pages, during the meeting, available for changing the text at our convenience (http://ubuntuaz.selfip.com/page2.html  http://ubuntuaz.selfip.com/page3.html).   It was also decided that Wolf_45 should be added to the Web Team, to help with HTML content.

The meeting was adjourned at 9:37 PM
