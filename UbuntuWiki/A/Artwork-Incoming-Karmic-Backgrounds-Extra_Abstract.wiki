* Wow.  You and <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:bryanlbasil]]</nowiki> are definitely on to something here with this color palette let alone the design.  Nice work.  I am now having trouble deciding which one I like better. Both of these backgrounds are integrating very well with my themes I'm developing. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dashua]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

The goal of this picture was mystical and at the same time home 
so the blue is the home feeling and the black is the mystical felling
the original picture was only the bubbles but that didnt feel home so i upgraded it to this.
My Blue Mystical Home
Hope you like it
I have now noticed that you guys dont want thoose colors so i will maybe make another background in ubuntu flavours i got a nice idea!

* I like this background except for the bubbles on the left side. The glow and color don't fit as well with a dark screen theme as the lines on the right. I think darkening the gradient (or increasing the opacity) of the triangle in the bottom right would help in reducing the contrast of the piece. Keep up the good work. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:adam-w-knox]]</nowiki>

* These lack a license -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:t-w-]]</nowiki>  * Nice! These are my favorite so far. I would love to see something with the colors reversed as well. So that the main background color is pale, with orange highlight/gradients over top. Keep it up -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:adam-w-knox]]</nowiki>

* Cool concept. Could you do the same in a larger size, ideally 2560 x 1600 pixels? The tree should be continued, to look healthy. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:t-w-]]</nowiki>  * Very cute and clever, I love it! Nice work, but I also agree with t-w-'s comment regarding the tree as well. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:blueyonder64]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

I wanted to show all of the older themes, in order of release, combined with the new Karmic Koala theme and I thought this would be an interesting and unique way to show all of the themes, which are separate but connected. I added a bit of a glow around the koala to emphasize it, but without drowning out the other animals.

Each animal took several hours of detailed and precise work. Besides all of them being stuffed animals, I also wanted to connect them through color, so instead of leaving them all in color, I changed them to a more brown- or sepia-type color.
