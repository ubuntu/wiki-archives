=== About Me ===

I'm using Linux systems for over 10 years now. In the past, I've used Red Hat, Mandrake, Suse, Debian, Gentoo, FreeBSD and OpenSolaris. Currently, I moved to use Ubuntu (Gnome) exclusively. I currently run Oneiric Ocelot on my main machine and various versions in virtual environments.

I work in the IT industry for the last 10.5 years. I've been a help desk tech, system administrator, an IT team manager, system engineer and now, an Integration Engineer. My day to day job consist of creating automatic installations packages of my company products'.
