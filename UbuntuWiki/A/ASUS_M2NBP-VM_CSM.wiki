=== Notes ===
'''Upgrading the BIOS to latest version is recommended. This could fix some minor bugs.''' ''(Do not use EZ-Flash to flash BIOS if your BIOS version is prior to 0601.)''.

Everything works out of the box, no special configuration required excepting the installation of nVidia video drivers ''(just enable nVidia graphics driver in Restricted Drivers Manager)''. If you have two monitors, by default, they are mirrored. If you wanna extended desktop, you need to run nvidia-setting as root or manually edit xorg.conf as instructed in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo
