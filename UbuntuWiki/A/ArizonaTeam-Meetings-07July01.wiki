I have a new email address now   Johnc4510-cox@ubuntu.com   although my old address is still good. I was also asked to Volunteer as a US Loco Team Mentor here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/USTeams   Both teams only have one or two people and are never in channel so nothing to do for now.

Jul 01 21:28:22 <johnc4510>	which has some others

Jul 01 21:29:17 <johnc4510>	yes
Jul 01 21:29:20 <bluecat9>	but CD won't hold it all.. ;p
Jul 01 21:29:30 <bluecat9>	I ask because many do not own a DVD drive
Jul 01 21:29:45 <johnc4510>	bluecat9: me either
Jul 01 21:29:49 <bluecat9>	SloggerKhan, i see
Jul 01 21:29:54 <SloggerKhan>	I think most people have DVD-ROM, not dvd-rw
Jul 01 21:29:59 <bluecat9>	The DVD is cool, we just need a CD version ;)
Jul 01 21:30:08 <bluecat9>	SloggerKhan, I do not.
Jul 01 21:30:14 <johnc4510>	but we have a member in kingston   not the right city   who is doing the dvd
Jul 01 21:30:24 <bluecat9>	out of 5 computers in my house ;p
Jul 01 21:30:26 *	br24 returns
Jul 01 21:30:33 <johnc4510>	so we may have dvd and cd
Jul 01 21:30:36 <SloggerKhan>	I can switch back to a regular ubuntu cover easy enough.
Jul 01 21:30:40 <br24>	guess I missed most of the meeting
Jul 01 21:30:40 <bluecat9>	wb br24
Jul 01 21:30:49 <johnc4510>	SloggerKhan: i thought as much on switching 
Jul 01 21:30:50 <bluecat9>	SloggerKhan, sounds good

Jul 01 21:32:19 <SloggerKhan>	Ok, I'll modify my post.
Jul 01 21:32:20 <johnc4510>	SloggerKhan: if you can
Jul 01 21:32:28 <johnc4510>	SloggerKhan: ty :)
Jul 01 21:32:50 <johnc4510>	ok if no more discussion on that we'll move on
Jul 01 21:33:18 *	johnc4510 asks br24 to update ed team now please
Jul 01 21:33:20 <johnc4510>	:))
Jul 01 21:33:50 <br24>	after many thoughts, I have made some updates to the Edu team
Jul 01 21:34:42 <br24>	because there are many tutorials in Ubuntu Docs, I thought it would be best to display some categories of common tools used
Jul 01 21:34:55 <br24>	such as web browsers, VMs, chat clients, email clients
Jul 01 21:35:15 <br24>	here is what I have done so far
Jul 01 21:35:16 <br24>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Education/VM
Jul 01 21:35:42 <br24>	I gave some apps that fit in this category, and linked them to the actuall Ubuntu install doc
Jul 01 21:36:08 <br24>	I believe this should give people a wider array of what is out there
Jul 01 21:36:17 <johnc4510>	br24: nice
Jul 01 21:36:32 <br24>	another idea is a recommendation from bluecat9
Jul 01 21:37:04 <br24>	I will start creating a beginners FAQ page to help new beginners on the basic elements of Ubuntu
Jul 01 21:37:28 <br24>	any ideas on this from anybody is definitely welcomed
Jul 01 21:37:50 <johnc4510>	br24: since this education team   how about linking to this guide page   http://easylinux.info/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
Jul 01 21:38:00 <br24>	my ultimate goal for our Edu team is to be the one-stop for new people in AZ
Jul 01 21:38:04 <bluecat9>	awesome, i'd say just think of it as if it were your 1st time using Ubuntu :)
Jul 01 21:38:08 <slofgren>	hey guys sorry to miss the meeting I was literally fighting a fire today
Jul 01 21:38:35 <johnc4510>	slofgren: welcome
Jul 01 21:38:35 <br24>	I would rather have AZ beginners going to our wiki to learn how to do something
Jul 01 21:38:43 <slofgren>	thanks
Jul 01 21:38:45 <bluecat9>	br24, agreed
Jul 01 21:39:10 <johnc4510>	br24: then can we incorporate things from that page into our wiki page    for basics
Jul 01 21:39:11 <johnc4510>	?
Jul 01 21:39:37 <bluecat9>	br24, i like the idea of it.. something printer friendly also.. my grandma loves to print things, then take it one step at a time, at her own pace. ;)
Jul 01 21:39:58 <br24>	basically, yes
Jul 01 21:40:07 <johnc4510>	br24: also how to install tar balls and use gdebi package mgr for deb packages?
Jul 01 21:40:19 <br24>	johnc4510, yes
Jul 01 21:40:37 <jsonder>	br24:  feel free to swipe anything fromhere http://members.cox.net/jsonder/
Jul 01 21:40:38 <br24>	the unofficial Ubuntu guide is also linked to the Edu team page
Jul 01 21:40:45 <johnc4510>	br24: i think those basic items would work well with the idea of the team
Jul 01 21:40:51 <johnc4510>	good
Jul 01 21:40:59 <br24>	ty jsonder
Jul 01 21:41:32 <bluecat9>	no offense but I just don't see grandma using Terminal... ;) if possible to avoid, please do
Jul 01 21:41:52 <johnc4510>	br24: i know a great install how to you can look at    but can't find link right now,  remind me tomorrow please
Jul 01 21:42:03 <br24>	also, if anyone would like to help me, I would like that
Jul 01 21:42:05 <johnc4510>	bluecat9: hee hee

Jul 01 21:43:35 <johnc4510>	ok
Jul 01 21:43:47 <johnc4510>	next is talking about approval team
Jul 01 21:44:07 <johnc4510>	SloggerKhan: It is my understanding that it would be better for you to not be lead on the comp4kids project. Is this correct?
Jul 01 21:44:24 <SloggerKhan>	yes, that's correct.
Jul 01 21:44:32 <johnc4510>	ok    np   
Jul 01 21:44:36 <SloggerKhan>	I won't be able to manage a lot of time in the future.

Jul 01 21:55:56 <johnc4510>	?
Jul 01 21:55:58 <bluecat9>	I'd like to propose some mediums for Team Donations
Jul 01 21:56:07 <johnc4510>	go
Jul 01 21:56:21 <bluecat9>	I would love to see a team paypal account and bank account --preferably John's as he is the Team Lead ;)
Jul 01 21:56:27 <bluecat9>	...where we can send donations
Jul 01 21:56:52 <bluecat9>	i think we should have the paypal email something like donations@azloco.org
Jul 01 21:56:59 <bluecat9>	or donate@azloco.org
Jul 01 21:57:09 <bluecat9>	and on the wiki
Jul 01 21:57:14 *	johnc4510 asks what everyone thinks of bluecat9 's idea
Jul 01 21:57:15 <bluecat9>	with a donations wiki page
Jul 01 21:57:17 <slofgren>	or maybe setup a group email list
Jul 01 21:57:47 *	johnc4510 says slofgren seems to like idea
Jul 01 21:57:48 <bluecat9>	to clarify, i am speaking strictly of donating monies
Jul 01 21:57:55 <slofgren>	that maybe jumpin gahead to quick. maybe I am wrong
Jul 01 21:58:13 <bluecat9>	i have some plans to raise team funds but we need the groundwork --a place to store the money
Jul 01 21:58:44 <slofgren>	lets wait till we have some money then worry about it
Jul 01 21:58:56 <bluecat9>	would love to see a team paypal account and a bank account for those who dont use paypal and want to do a bank money transfer
Jul 01 21:58:59 <bluecat9>	from bank to bank
Jul 01 21:59:08 *	johnc4510 says it is an idea worth consideration and we should maybe look into it and talk at future meetings?
Jul 01 21:59:11 <bluecat9>	i may have money next week :)
Jul 01 21:59:16 <johnc4510>	k
Jul 01 21:59:21 <johnc4510>	bluecat9: k
Jul 01 21:59:26 <br24>	I think this is a good idea
Jul 01 21:59:29 <johnc4510>	anyone else
Jul 01 21:59:31 <johnc4510>	?
Jul 01 21:59:36 <br24>	although I may be quite limited for the time being
Jul 01 21:59:38 <slofgren>	lets alos be sure to not turn this into a money begging group
Jul 01 22:00:03 <bluecat9>	not at all... i just want a medium to be available
Jul 01 22:00:20 <johnc4510>	slofgren: agreed,   i had hoped to make our team self supporting in future
Jul 01 22:00:22 <bluecat9>	im not giving money out of pocket, im going to create ways for us to make money and donate proceeds
Jul 01 22:00:25 <slofgren>	I am personally not interested or able to give money to this group but I am willing to donate time and extra equipment
Jul 01 22:00:39 <bluecat9>	exactly
Jul 01 22:00:41 <johnc4510>	slofgren: agreed
Jul 01 22:00:57 <slofgren>	I say lets not spread out focus too thin and wait til money is a problem
Jul 01 22:01:16 <bluecat9>	I'm just trying to set the groundwork for other projects
Jul 01 22:01:28 <bluecat9>	Project C4K will need money to be effective :)
Jul 01 22:01:31 <slofgren>	though I don't want to keep knocking others ideas
Jul 01 22:01:41 *	johnc4510 says that we should consider all ideas,  but team should agree on everything
Jul 01 22:01:55 <johnc4510>	slofgren: np   your part of team
Jul 01 22:02:16 <johnc4510>	bluecat9: we will work on it some more and then ask team again
Jul 01 22:02:21 <bluecat9>	ty
Jul 01 22:02:33 <johnc4510>	bluecat9: np  :)
Jul 01 22:03:07 <johnc4510>	bluecat9: we do need a way to funnel $ from your project   when it starts producing
Jul 01 22:03:09 <johnc4510>	:)
Jul 01 22:03:16 <slofgren>	I guess I missed the server update?
Jul 01 22:03:54 <johnc4510>	slofgren: DX00 not here but he told me that they were getting a compatible cdrom 
Jul 01 22:04:10 <johnc4510>	hopefully that will take care of problem
Jul 01 22:04:23 <johnc4510>	lug is working with him on it
Jul 01 22:04:30 <slofgren>	k
Jul 01 22:04:32 <bluecat9>	I have something in the works that can make a little money and pretty much everyone should be able to get involved with it :)
Jul 01 22:04:46 <bluecat9>	I am going to test it and get the process down pat before I post details
Jul 01 22:04:47 <johnc4510>	and as far as i know paying for parts
Jul 01 22:04:55 <johnc4510>	bluecat9: ty
Jul 01 22:05:09 *	johnc4510 asks if that is all for tonight
Jul 01 22:05:11 <johnc4510>	?
