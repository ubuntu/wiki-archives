== Testimonials ==
*** j.scott.gwin@ubuntu.com When I moved to AZ in 2008 the Ubuntu Arizona LoCo already existed.  If it hadn't been here my life would be very different.  This team provided me an immediate peer group and it continues to be a major hub in my social life.  The continuous support and activities surrounding this LoCo have added the "Ubuntu Experience" to many many lives in AZ and has touched people's in other States and Countries.  I'm positive the Council doesn't have to think long or hard about renewing this Team's membership.  It's simple - this team works very hard and consistently to be and do everything a LoCo team should.  Without 'The Hottest loCo on Earth' many people would lose a huge part of their lives and Ubuntu would also suffer loss.
*** I have had contact with the Arizona Ubuntu LoCo for quite some time now. I have often benefited from the tips and tricks, relayed back and forth in formal and informal meetings. I enjoy meeting with the people, and the install fests are a phenomenal example of service and advocacy of Linux/Ubuntu. The AZLoCo has shown time and time again its positive impact as a champion for Ubuntu and the values it represents.

*** meskes@gmail.com I've used Ubuntu since the first release, back in 2004. I found the team in 2006 and started to interact with them. After that, I have been regular ever since. The sense of community that this team has is bar-none, in my opinion. As a long time user I often find myself on the giving as well as the receiving end of "tips and tricks" as well as giving general advice to other users who may or may not be as experienced as myself. 

*** What really blows me away however, is when you find those users who are genuinely prodigies on the platform, whom have never had any formal training in their lives. They just either sat down with a book and read, or they just "did". If I had never found this channel, I honestly think that I would have never met some of these prodigies. In a way, while I was doing my personal form of "community outreach", the community actually turned around reached out to me. I personally think, while it may be one of the smaller of the LoCos, the ambassadorship of the AzLoCo ranks right up there with the largest of teams and the value it provides for Ubuntu and the Open Source community, in general is invaluable.
