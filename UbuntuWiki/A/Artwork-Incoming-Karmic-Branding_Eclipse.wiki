Eclipse Ubuntu needs a new Splash screen, even Fedora has one.

=== Concept ===
Adding a realistic icon and keeping consistency with Ubuntu main parts. This work and other I'll do, will be based on the Ubuntu GDM theme and Splash screen. This will guarantee consistency between item on the system.

Also, targeting version specific splash, will help us to add a newer version of Eclipse to the repositories.

=== Comments ===
I　like it a lot, though I think it would be somewhat more interesting if it was 3.5 Galileo. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:lordmetroid]]</nowiki>
