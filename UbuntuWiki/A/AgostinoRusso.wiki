== About ==

Hi, 

I am Agostino Russo, but everyone calls me Ago,

I am the author and maintainer of <nowiki>[[http://wuabi-installer.org/|Wubi]]</nowiki> which in turns is based on the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/lupin|Lupin project]]</nowiki> and this <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/ubuntu-setup.exe|original blueprint]]</nowiki>. I am now helping the ubuntu-installer team to make Wubi an official installer (InstallerForWindows).  

I like to dedicate my (little) spare time to open source projects. Usually after my kids are in bed. I work as a quant in a financial company, I have a PhD in finance and a major in economics, but I have been programming since I was 11, starting with the fantastic Commodore64. I have been using Linux exclusively since 2000, and Ubuntu since Warty. Before that it was Red Hat, Mandrake, Gentoo, Debian. My preferred programming language is Python  (not much of that in Wubi unfortunately).

== Projects ==

Most of my activity has been focused around Wubi, which is now shipping with Ubuntu and it is fast approaching 1 million downloads. But have also done some other minor works.

=== Umenu ===
 I am the author of Umenu, it is the Winfoss replacement that now ships with Ubuntu. It also allows users to boot off CD sparing them the annoyance of having to change the boot order in the BIOS (using Wubi --cdboot).

=== Wubi ===
I designed and wrote most of Wubi (installer frontend) and Lupin (installer backend, see below) and am the project leader.

* Original blueprint: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/ubuntu-setup.exe 
* Website: http://wubi-installer.org 
* LP project page: http://wubi-installer.org 
 
Other people also helped with Wubi design and implementation, in particular, Geza Kovacs and Oliver Mattos created the first Wubi prototypes, and Colin J Watson rewrote a large chunk of the installation code now in partman-auto-loop (and initramfs), Evan Dandrea also provided a tremendous help with several Ubuntu patches. Please see http://www.wubi-installer.org/faq.php#credits for a full list of developers.

=== Lupin ===
Lupin is the back-end of loopinstallation, it used to be a mechanism to override a regular ISO at runtime, now most of its functionality has been incorporated into Ubuntu (thanks to the efforts of Colin J Watson and Evan Dandrea as well as myself). Nowdays lupin is mostly used to provide external hooks to customize a casper installation using an ISO and a preseed file on hard disk. Plus it adds a few twists required by a loopinstalled system.

=== ZoomMapWidget ===
I wrote the new PyGTK widget, which was used as a base for the new timezone selector in Ubiquity. The control was an implementation of the specification in <nowiki>[[HardyUbiquityUsability]]</nowiki>, the control has subsequently been greatly improved and extended by Evan Dandrea.

* LP original code page: https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-installer/ubiquity/zoom-map-widget

=== Snappy ===
 Snappy is a C++ library to create a light and simple download manager with support for segmented downloads and metalinks. Hampus Wessman has done most of the work there but I hepled too.

=== Yeat Another Sudoku Solver ===
Admittedly not very useful (unless you get stacked...), and a bit O.T., but anyway:
