<<BR>><<BR>>

My name is Amirol Ahmad and I am from Malaysia. I was born on July 4th, 1986. Graduated from local university in Malaysia taken Computing Business IT. In 2006 I started learning the basic languages to build a simple website (mainly HTML and CSS) on my own. That began as a joke, but became my job some years later.

Currently I am working as Linux Sysadmin, Web and Mobile Application developer at Osem Network Enterprise. I used Ubuntu as my first Linux distro since 2008 and become addict to this Ubuntu. Now I am again on Ubuntu and love Unity: it's beautiful and intuitive!

I donate some amount to Ubuntu Malaysia Loco Team || http://wiki.ubuntu.com.my/Senarai_Penderma || to make them archived on our latest project related to Ubuntu. I am also like to join Ubuntu Translation behalf of my country.
