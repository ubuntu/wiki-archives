=== Montage Maker ===

<nowiki>[[attachment:montagemaker|Download Montage Maker]]</nowiki>

To use this script, point it at a directory with the images you wish to collate into one image. After this, choose a filename and location to save your montage.

* If you have problems with your svg thumbnailing in the montage, prerender a raster (pixel-based) version to place in the directory instead.
* The script will try to thumbnail ''everything'' in the directory, so prepare it properly first.
* The CLI mode requires first a directory and then the output filename.
* If you've saved it to the default location with Firefox, you could also run <code>chmod +x ~/Desktop/montagemaker</code> to make it executable

=== Thumbnailer ===

<nowiki>[[attachment:thumbnail|Download Thumbnailer]]</nowiki>

This script will thumbnail all the files you select, appending <code>_thumb</code> to them. There is a configuration section where you can change height, width, appended name, etc, as well as instructions for commenting and uncommenting some features.

* Be aware that the script by default will render a raster version of the svg with the same name.
* ''This will overwrite any prerendered version of the same name.''
* It supports raster and svg images, ''svg support requires Inkscape''
* To select multiple files, hold the control button while you select them.
* By default it automatically appends _thumb to the filename.
* If you've saved it to the default location with Firefox, you could also run <code>chmod +x ~/Desktop/thumbnail</code> to make it executable
