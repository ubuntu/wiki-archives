== Ibex Interface ==

Most of what I've seen in terms of interface design has been awfully conservative and not very intrepid at all. I have a proposal to kickstART the design paradigm. First is to get rid of the idea of desktop and background and wallpaper altogether. Using transparency and 3d dynamic elements jump off into more Heads up display kind of look and feel.

=== Concept ===
The curved horns of the Ibex can become a task bar which exists in a midlevel transparent space.Window icons would line up on the red line between yellow dots with transparent thumbs radiating outward.The Ubuntu logo would rotate and serve as a selection widget w/ the heads as buttons. The yellow background would show a preview of an item when it is moused over,touched,or otherwise selected Item would foreground on tap and interface would dissolve until recalled.
