=== Introduction ===
My name is Alexander Telenga (Александр Теленьга in Russian). My nickname in IRC is Voland (one of the main characters in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita|The Master and Margarita]]</nowiki> book).
I'm from Russia, Krasnodar. I was graduated in <nowiki>[[http://www.kubsu.ru/|Kuban State University]]</nowiki> as "mathematician, a system programmer" specialist.
I'm a PhD. My occupation is a lecturer in Univercity, <nowiki>[[http://www.inepkuban.ru/|Institute of economy, law and humanities]]</nowiki>.
Nowadays my favourite programming language is Python (but I'm newbie :)). I'm more than quite familiar with Pascal and Delphi.
==== My current Ubuntu activities ====
I'm a member of RussianTeam.
I've translated a part of ServerGuide in Launchpad into Russian.
Now I'm trying to do my best in translations.
