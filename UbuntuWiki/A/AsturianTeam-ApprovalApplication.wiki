The Ubuntu-ast (aka Comunidad Asturiana de Ubuntu) is an small (but hyperactive) Ubuntu enthusiast group in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias|Asturies]]</nowiki>. We work with <nowiki>[[http://softastur.org|Softastur]]</nowiki> LUG in the translations.

We're working hard for expand Ubuntu in Spanish & Asturian language in our autonomous community. By the Asturian language we appeared more times in the news.

We have a diverse membership: students, developers, philologists, photographers, designers ..., and of course, we believe in an Open and Free (as in freedom) community through Ubuntu.

We're thinking all times, how improve the Ubuntu expansion with new ideas.

==== Testimonials ====

* I think the approval of the Asturian LoCo is long due. When I had the pleasure to spend some days with them, I was truly amazed at their drive and passion for Free Software, for their language, and their commitment with Ubuntu. They are working hard to promote the usage of Ubuntu in the Asturies region, regularly organizing activities and having <nowiki>[[http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/2022|successfully worked with regional institutions]]</nowiki> for the adoption of our Operating System. Their translation activity is also legendary. Launchpad allowed them to provide the first ever OS in the Asturian language, but the merit is all theirs: tirelessly translating for months, they had several team members in the top contributors list (Iñigo is still <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+topcontributors|there]]</nowiki>), a time in which they also learned how to send back all those contributions to the main upstream projects. I fully support their application. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dpm]]</nowiki> 
* In the Asturian-community, the work system is centralized in the LoCo Team. The Team decides which projects to do, elect a coordinator for the upstream, and work directly with him. Thus, there is no problems of understanding. The team meets on the last Friday of every month, and the main priority is Ubuntu. Right now our goal is to include the use of <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqOZ16kCuqw|Ubuntu in Education]]</nowiki>. The members are very active and they keep a constant work; they don't know limits and this is simply because they believe in a free software in a free community. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:ivarela]]</nowiki> 
* For a long time, I have been working with Marcos for improving Asturian Loco and found a great potential in there. They have worked without interruption for a long time, with really interesting ideas and success. I found outstanding the results considering the size of the community. I hope they will be approved. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:rafael-carreras]]</nowiki> (Catalan LoCo Team)
