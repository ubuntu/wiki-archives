Installed Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake). Everything works. RAM/CPU detected and work. LAN auto-detected, sound fully functional. No problems.

Same results with Kubuntu 6.06 (Dapper).

Note: Although not a problem with Linux, be aware that some types of RAM (notably OCZ and others that require higher than normal voltages) are not compatible with this motherboard.

(when wakeup from hibernate, the sata controller/disks won't wake up.. maybe fixed in gutsy kernel)

Received [errno5]at 30% partition format when trying to install 7.10 and 8.04. Tried both 32 bit and 64 bit.  All hardware diagnostics tools responded with no errors.  Moved the dimms from bank A1 and B1 to A2 and B2.  This resolved the issue but the trade off is no dual channel optimization.
