=== Minutes ===

    Action item review was brief: everyone was concentrated on other things.  Spec review was similarly brief, and there was no progress on tracked bugs.  NSLU2 enablement is considered complete, but will be left on the roadmap to track any regressions.  In Babbage enablement, Redboot is packaged, there are a couple bugs being tracked fairly carefully (#344370, #344955).  There was discussion of target images, and there was agreement to generate both live and alternate images, if possible: the main remaining issue being handling of kernel installs and updates.
