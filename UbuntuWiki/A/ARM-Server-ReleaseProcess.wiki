== ARM Server Release Process ==

This page is not complete. It is intended to hold a checklist to be followed prior to every Ubuntu release, including dot releases.

At least two weeks before release, the following needs to be decided:
* Which boards we will be verifying (QA)
* For each board, which installation method we will be verifying
* For each of the above, what will be documented and what old documentation will be removed (eg. for old boards that may continue to work but QA will be dropped for).

The following pages need to be checked and updated if the list of supported systems for ARM Server changes. This list may not be exhaustive.

* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/Server
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/Server/Install
* Update cdimage pages for supported releases:
** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04/release/
** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/12.10/release/
** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot/precise/
** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot/quantal/
