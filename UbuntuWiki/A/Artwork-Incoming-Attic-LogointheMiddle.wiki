It's just the ubuntu logo in the middle of "ubuntu" script, so it takes less space. it can be used for XMMS (bug # <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xmms/+bug/74010|74010]]</nowiki>)

== Logo ==

Following are the logo in png and xcf (gimp format). I don't know how to do this in svg format...

<nowiki>[[attachment:logo.xcf]]</nowiki>
<nowiki>[[File:logo.png]]</nowiki>

Please use it as you wish. If Canonical's licenses '''don't''' forbid it, I release this to the public domain.
