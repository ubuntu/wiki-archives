__TOC__

Was born at a young age, is a research nerd at ANU (Australian National University), works on Medical Imaging processing code and maintains the MINC toolbox. 

Amusingly I myself do not maintain the ubuntu MINC package(s) as Steve Robbins just happens to do that out of the goodness of his heart, perhaps in the future I might finally pull my finger out and help him. In the meantime I build my own conflicting packages here:

   http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/

I do however subscribe to the bug reports and attempt to integrate diffs back into MINC upstream.

Time, time.
