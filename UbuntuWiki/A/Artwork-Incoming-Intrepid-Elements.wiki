=== Elements ===
----
Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth.  Those are the main elements of nature.  With the elements theme, it is bring those elements to you in the form of top-to bottom themes.  

=== Pallete ===
----
There needs to be four palletes, one for each element. 

Water should focus on the cool blues, maybe a blubuntu pallete.

Fire needs Red-Black.

Wind needs cool greens-white.

Earth needs a natural feel to it, maybe the same shades that Ubuntu have now.

=== Inspiration ===
----
Post here some images that could help people to develop ideas.
