<ththandle> ack-fin:
<ack-fin> oops...typo
<xHans> _ericcc: you need to be a minion for several weeks before there's really any benefit
<xHans> bwuahahahahha :)
<ththandle> :-P
<ack-fin> meaning you'll be short, yellow, and wear a scubva mask at all times
<Oboro> By benefit he means bring down the network with hans' account
<ththandle> but minions are killed off  not a good long term plan . . .
<xHans> Cabo Dan Lucas? is that the Star Wars guy's south of the border cousin?
<ack-fin> xHans: I'n ubcertain....ex-cia and won't give strasight answers
<toddc> azloco.com emails ar still availible also if anyone wants to use one
<ththandle> Is he writing in code now?
<ack-fin> you know the type:  always carries a cyanide cap inside a cigarette pack in his pocket
<Dazed_75> While we are kinda paused, everyone think about if AZloco should hold physical meetings and what you would like out of them
* Ryan_J has quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.90 [Firefox 18.0.2/20130201065344])
<Oboro> the good ones have it implanted in a tooth
<ththandle> I will put the word out toddc ,
<Oboro> Dazed_75: where and when would the meetings be?
<toddc> and kittens!
<ack-fin> Oboro: yeah, I'[m not man enbough for that - afraid my next seisure could be my last by accident
<ththandle> I would like to see one at MCC now and then. Big pool of new peeps to intrest?!
<turbidtux> [R]:  well... there goes six figures.....
<ththandle> interest
<[R]> lol
<Dazed_75> Likely at at a Tempe facility.  We would have to pay a few bucks for a janitor
<Dazed_75> We'd love to be at MCC but it seems not to be in the cards if we can't have PLUG there any more
<toddc>  Linux app of the week
<toddc> Pianobar   pianobar is a free/open-source, console-based client for the personalized online radio Pandora.
<toddc> http://6xq.net/projects/pianobar/
<turbidtux> Dazed_75: Yes, presentations, like for software to replace whats on the other two popular OS's
<ththandle> With xHans there and our new Tech group I was hoping to bring plug back in the BA40 building?
<ththandle> as a guest once a month
<toddc> Pianobar to Conky
<toddc> http://i.imgur.com/Hnq9c.jpg
<ththandle> I was looking into it. I will get back with everyone.
<xHans> ththandle: dennisk indicated we couldn't regularly get the same room
<toddc> that would be cool if possible
<Oboro> hans: Why does it have to be the same room?
<xHans> we'd like to stay at MCC, but it sounded like it's no longer an option
<xHans> Oboro: for the same reason classes and business offices don't move around :), it's hard for people to find us
<Oboro> It is a shame that, that is the case
<ththandle> well I will have to talk about that in our group meeting. It is my hope to build the group not kick it around.
<xHans> ththandle: yeah
<Oboro> .. I have had classes move around makes life interesting!
<Oboro> hans: what about the conference room in the library?
<xHans> a student group has more options at MCC ( which should be the case ), also by meeting during the day there are more rooms available
<ththandle> Oboro: no comment from the peanut gallary
<xHans> Oboro: that would work if we could get it
<ththandle> ok now that is a good idea
<Oboro> ththandle: that is the best place to comment from!
<ththandle>  ha ha ha
<Oboro> hans: do they post a schedule for the conference rooms do you know?
<xHans> Oboro: I think the rose society meets during the time we'd need it and they've been there since before MCC was ( I think the campus was built around them ), plus they give the college tons and tons of dough, so they're not budging
<ththandle> MikeofMany: do you still have the desk?
<MikeofMany> ththandle, which desk?
<ththandle> the one you were going to throw out. I still want it
<_ericcc> ththandle: wrong mike :p
<xHans> Oboro: don't know, dennisk has been handling MCC scheduling for us ( I believe Colleen does the actual reservations )
<MikeofMany> yeah don't think I'm that mike
<ththandle> oh , dang it . sorry
<Oboro> hans: that is a shame the room is a decent size.. I don't know of any other conference rooms now that they ruined the kirk center
<ththandle> he has too many handles
<MikeofMany> no worries, I was about to say that was over 4 years ago
<toddc> are we ready to go over the schedules?
<ththandle> yeah why the change at the conference center. why was it not at BA40 to start with ?
<toddc> UBUNTU HOUR
<toddc> Thursday Febuary 28 is the next Ubuntu Hour at Extreme Bean in Tempe southern and McClintock
<toddc> http://xtremebeancoffee.com
<toddc> this a 1-2 hour social hour to meet new/old users and chat about linux and open source. Stop by and say hi!!
<xHans> Oboro: I don't know, feel free to check into it if you can, staying at MCC is definitely our preferred solution
<toddc> this a 1-2 hour social hour to meet new/old users and chat about linux and open source. Stop by and say hi!!
