[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:12:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	I'm wondering if we should start a google calendar for all the LUGs, SIGs, etc. to post there meetings to. I'm thinking that might encourage some more interaction between the groups.
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:12:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	this is for you too xHans
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:12:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	we've toyed with this
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:12:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	but i think we need to do it
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:13:02] <xHans>	any word on the intrepid project to have a calendar server?
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:13:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	not that i know of
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:13:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	it would be nice to have a central calendar to see what's going on in the state
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:13:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:13:57] <xHans>	I agree that we need some sort of event clearing house calendar
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:14:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	sure meetings, events, etc
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:14:27] <xHans>	I would like us to host the master calendar, but exporting it to google would be fine
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:14:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	at least to start with is what i'm thinking
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:15:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	then if we get participation, we can think about another site
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:15:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	?

[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:20:01] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: merci dank!
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:20:36] <xHans>	a good calendaring server is something we're missing from infrastructure
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:21:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	if we have ideas for talks should we submit to the mailing list for everyone to discuss
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:21:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	or have you got a list already
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:21:22] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: from the organizing committee? yes.

[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:25:49] <xHans>	those interested in helping put on the conference should join the list and start participating
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:26:19] <xHans>	we don't have to have a keynote speaker and need to see if we even really have room for one
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:26:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	greatk
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:26:49] <xHans>	I would suggest we come up with a list of 2 or 3 people we'd like to have and contact them, we want people who'll draw a crowd
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:27:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	you'd know better than me on that
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:27:13] <xHans>	if we don't get them, we'll skip it this time around and concentrate on other areas

[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:30:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: can you tell us how the food thing is going to work at UAT
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:31:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	do they just set it up and everyone pays or do we have to guarantee a minimum?
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:31:15] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: nope :)
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:31:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	k
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:31:34] <xHans>	they don't require us to get food, but if we do get food they require us to get it through them
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:32:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah ok
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:32:14] <xHans>	that's something that can be decided in 2 or 3 weeks, so I'm not worried about it :)
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:32:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	i just wondered how it worked
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:32:38] <xHans>	I don't know, not sure they do
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:32:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	k
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:32:48] <xHans>	I think this is a new policy for UAT
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:32:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	what about starting on the sponsors?
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:33:54] <xHans>	that can start as soon as you find some to talk to :)
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:34:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, anything else?
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:34:28] <xHans>	we're at the point to start needing some infrastructure, such as a wiki
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:34:38] <xHans>	let's hash that all out on the list
[Sun Jul 27 2008] [21:34:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	k
