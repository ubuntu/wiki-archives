Anyway, we will be meeting at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe on Sat. April 24th after the Installfest at UAT.  Hans is making reservations for us to have the room upstairs at Boulders.

[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:03:52] <scott_ev>	Ubuntu 10.04 LTS will ship in April 2010 and is the culmination of significant work in Ubuntu, in Debian and across the free software ecosystem. LTS releases are maintained for five years on the server and three years on the desktop, so they are designed for those who are making larger deployments or who otherwise prefer to have a common platform for an extended period. Lucid will continue our tradition of focusing an LTS on a quali

[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:04:56] <scott_ev>	The Ubuntu Forums have grown to be one of the largest linux forums on the internet today with over 970,000 users.

[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:05:37] <scott_ev>	Phoronix's Michael Larabel reports that Mark Shuttleworth has just announced this morning via a blog post that he will be stepping down as the CEO of Canonical, the formal company behind Ubuntu Linux. Jane Silber, the current COO of Canonical, will be taking over Mark's position as the CEO.

[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:06:25] <scott_ev>	Phoronix's Michael Larabel reports that Mark Shuttleworth has just announced this morning via a blog post that he will be stepping down as the CEO of Canonical, the formal company behind Ubuntu Linux. Jane Silber, the current COO of Canonical, will be taking over Mark's position as the CEO.
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:06:35] <Yorokobi>	The like worked for me
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:06:39] <scott_ev>	Mark Shuttleworth though will not be leaving Canonical, but rather he wishes to focus more of his time on bettering Ubuntu and its products rather than the formal business responsibilities. From his blog post, "I've become very passionate about design and quality, and want to spend more time figuring out how we harness the collaborative process to build better, more insightful products."
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:06:53] <scott_ev>	Shuttleworth will be formally stepping down as the Chief Executive Officer in March when Jane Silber takes over.

[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:07:17] <scott_ev>	I'm learnin as I go
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:07:24] <tyche>	Yep
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:07:31] <scott_ev>	Michael Larabel of Phoronix states that Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 1 was released last week and while it did not bring any major features yet for this Long-Term Support release, it began to introduce some underlying changes like the switch to the Linux 2.6.32 kernel, X Server 1.7, and the complete removal of HAL.
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:07:33] <tyche>	And we're supporting you.
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:07:37] <scott_ev>	thx
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:07:51] <scott_ev>	Larabel's early benchmarks of Ubuntu 10.04 show that there are some negative performance regressions right off the bat, but one area that Canonical is focusing upon in particular with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is speeding up the boot process.
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:08:09] <scott_ev>	Also surfacing this month is a new kernel that pulls in more of Intel's Moblin speed patches from their kernel. As most know, Moblin 2 boots extremely fast.
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:08:23] <scott_ev>	Phoronix has tested out this kernel with the Moblin patches on Ubuntu 9.10 and it booted three seconds faster compared to the stock Karmic kernel.
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:08:44] <scott_ev>	===========
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:09:10] <scott_ev>	"In Mozilla’s words, “Prism is an application that lets users split Web applications out of their browser and run them directly on their desktop.” In practical terms, that means you can have individual browser windows dedicated to specific Web applications–like Gmail, Facebook or Twitter–without having to worry about them becoming mixed up with your other Firefox tabs or needing to be restarted if you restart your browser.
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:09:14] <Flakeparadigm>	scott_ev: I boot to the desktop in lucid (including time to type password in) in 35 seconds or so. They are doing pretty good

[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:10:19] <scott_ev>	guys, feel free to jump in anytime with comments, observations, etc
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:10:40] <scott_ev>	LinuxDevices.com's Eric Brown tells us that Jolicloud released a public beta of its Ubuntu-based, cloud-oriented Jolicloud Linux distribution for netbooks. The free, open source distro offers fast boot-ups, a netbook-optimized interface, and Intel GMA500 graphics support, while running both web-based and native Linux apps.
[Sunday 27 December 2009] [21:11:07] <scott_ev>	The distribution offers both Firefox 3.5.3 and Prism 1.0b2 browsers, and supports a wide variety of wireless protocols, as well as audio and video formats. Jolicloud founder and CEO Tariq Krim, "Traditional operating systems find their roots in the late seventies and are built around software. But today, 90 percent of our computing life is on the Web. Jolicloud was built with Web users in mind."
