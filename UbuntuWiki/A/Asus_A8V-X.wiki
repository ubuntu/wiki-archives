__TOC__

Tested on Edgy Eft (6.10). This motherboard works well by default but won't recognize PCI cards. To do so you must add the option '''pci=conf1''' at the end of the kernel command in the grub boot default secuence this way:

/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash locale=es_ES '''pci=conf1'''
