=== This is the place to post your ideas for the Gutsy artwork, most importantly the wallpaper. ===

'''Gutsy is pretty much finalised, submit any new ideas to <nowiki>[[..-Hardy-Alternate|the Hardy IDEAS page.]]</nowiki>'''
* The official guidelines will be posted soon, it is only available for contributing takes and submissions.

The goal is to get back to something as unique and beautiful as included in previous versions:
<nowiki>[[File:older_versions3.jpg]]</nowiki>

{{
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/WallpaperRules now contains a prelimary list of suggestions for your creation.
it is by no means official or approved by anyone but the author , me , and I don't have any authority.
You may wish to examine it for the instruction it provides will apply very well to all of the art created on this page.

I am working on a simple palette to start from. Coming soon! Using the colors shown in the images above or the color palette below are the best starting point.
  -- Lets get this colour palette up and running. Anyone have any suggestions? Where are the previous versions? [LasseGullvågSætre2] <<DateTime>>
  -- Can we add black and white to the color list? Or perhaps very close substitutes (#eee and #111?) [PrashantVaibhav]
Here is what we have had until now, pretty much:

<nowiki>[[File:oldpalette.png]]</nowiki>

Let's just stay away from the pinkish colors :-)
=== Submissions ===

Add your ideas below. For more detailed discussion and feedback please use the mailing list.

==== Junel's ideas ====
After reading the comments on dark wallpapers, I whipped up a couple of wallpapers. It's bright and cheerful and I think fits the human theme. It does contain the color brown but I also added yellow and green to the mix. See thumbnails below:

{{http://www.junelmujar.com/wallpapers/002_thumb.jpg}}
{{http://www.junelmujar.com/wallpapers/002_b_thumb.jpg}}
{{http://www.junelmujar.com/wallpapers/002_c_thumb.jpg}}

Full resolution here:

<nowiki>[[http://www.junelmujar.com/wallpapers/]]</nowiki>

* Now _this_ looks promising. Maybe you could create a version where the green and orange elements are more intertwined with both colors represented on both  sides of the screen. --Sokraates

==== Justin's ideas ====

I have uploaded a few pictures of mine, take a look and see if you like them.I know they don't conform to the Ubuntu palette, but I'll search for more pictures and fine ones that do.  I'm mainly looking for feedback on whether or not this is the kind of stuff we are looking for.

All three of these are too visually busy. I think you need to keep things simpler/subtler so that the actual /icons/ on the Desktop remain as the main focus. alex@weej.com

Heres another idea, just a basic sketch of my idea to have flowing Ubuntu logos across the screen as a background.  Keep in mind its not complete.  Send me feedback.

http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/xsidekick409/xsidekick409-4.jpg?t=1185574002

Justin---

Hey again.  I'm sort of having a hard time figuring out how to make a minimalistic background since most of the things I make are usually visually complicated.  Bear with me, its just about learning a new style.  Here's another sketch of an idea.

http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/xsidekick409/lightbulb.png?t=1186775384

--Justin

Update: http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/xsidekick409/lightbulb2.png?t=1187234593

The background is still a bit bland, I'm still working out something for it.
--Justin

--Durand--hese ones look awesome! I like the simplicity and the look of the lightbulbs.

==== Here are a few pics that I have been working on (kwwii) ====
note that brown fluid is a crop and edit of work I made from Joseph Connors - more stuff from him coming soon
<nowiki>[[File:GutsyWalls2.jpg]]</nowiki>

-Amazing job.  I like em.

--These are really great. --Strabes

--You have to change the name from "Brown Fluid" to something else. With a little more work it can be nice. -- Lassegs

-- Very Very nice. I hope one of those is in Gutsy -- Asjdfwejqrfjcvm Msz34rq33

==== As promised here is more work from Joseph Connors ====
<nowiki>[[File:JosephConnors.jpg]]</nowiki>
eh.... the best one I see here is 5019... who is this guy ? where did the rules for wallpaper creation go ? isn't there some rules somewhere for this kind of thing ?

...see above for a (very good) rough list of rules <nowiki>[[KennethWimer]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

Joseph is a talented photographer that I met through the KDE4/Oxygen contest for wallpapers (1900+ submissions). Actually we "found" him by surfing flickr (http://www.flickr.com/photos/jciv/) and then asking him if he would be interested in helping out. Note that these pics are rough sketches of what is possible and the colors are not 100% that what they should be. <nowiki>[[KennethWimer]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

There's a lot of amazing quality work on this page (that puts the Feisty and Edgy wallpapers to shame). I particularly love the new Joseph Connors selection, although I don't know how I'd go about choosing just one as a favourite. A small number of well chosen images from this page would make a fine collection for 'core' backgrounds for Gusty. --Oomingmak

==== My Humble Submissions (Robinhoover) ====

Tried to create some images that conveyed:  simple, strong, secure and expressive.

{{http://www.mdogstudios.com/private/ubuntu_wall_v1_smaller.png}}

and a bit more restrained:

{{http://www.mdogstudios.com/private/ubuntu_wall_v2_smaller.png}}

Larger 1600x1200 versions are available.  Thx for the chance to participate.

 I like these fairly well. Except that the logo is at such an angle, it makes the word Ubuntu look distorted. But overall, great job! --Asjdfwejqrfjcvm Msz34rq33

==== Animal textures ====

'''Lion'''

<nowiki>[[File:ubuntu-lion.jpg]]</nowiki>

This wallpaper's texture is based on a lion's mane.
You can see the full size (1680x1050) <nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu-lion-1680x1050.jpg|here]]</nowiki>.

<nowiki>[[Damianvila]]</nowiki> 
  Damianvila, great work. If you would remove the logo and make the fur just a bit brighter, you gt #1.
  you might also try to integrate something like the elements in brownfluid above by kwwii into the picture, to give it a unique element that kinda "brands" the image without using the name "ubuntu". <nowiki>[[terlmann]]</nowiki><<DateTime>>
  
  I really love the animal texture wallpapers, especially the brighter clear lion, but, I was wondering if there's any of these images available without the ubuntu logo in the middle?  I'm seriously not that stupid that I don't know what OS I'm using and need my wallpaper to tell me.  A version without branding would be wonderful.  I understand the reason behind setting the default to one with branding, I just think it would be really nice if we had these available without as well.  I did find the dark lion one buried amidst the other ones, am I just blind and missing clean versions of the other animal textures?  <nowiki>[[Trinkit]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>  

  <nowiki>[[File:ubuntu-lion_2.jpg]]</nowiki>

  I didn't like how dark it was and I used GIMP's "Expand HSV" or whatever it is called in the English version. I like this one better and I did the same adjustments to Damianvilas other wallpapers, the edited ones are in the attachments: <nowiki>[[Skiessi]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

1680x1050 version <nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu-lion-1680x1050_2.jpg|here]]</nowiki>.

'''Lion (clear version)'''

I've made the wallpapers a bit clearer, and I created a new clear one based on the lion's wallpaper - <nowiki>[[Damianvila]]</nowiki>

'''More ideas'''

I'd like to make versions with other animals, like hippos and zebras.
But i think it's OK as it is, as you can have a clear idea of the possibilities.

This one below is so you can have a rough idea of what it will be like without the logo and with "fluid" added <nowiki>[[Damianvila]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:ubuntu-lion-fluid.jpg]]</nowiki>

With "fluid" added. A bit darker, though. I need to improve it. <nowiki>[[Damianvila]]</nowiki> 
  Skiessi's edit <nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu-lion-fluid_2.jpg|here]]</nowiki> - <nowiki>[[Skiessi]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

Done. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Gutsy/Wallpaper --terlmann

  And speaking of faces... :-) - <nowiki>[[Damianvila]]</nowiki>

     Haha, this is great, but a little to spooky for my taste. Kinda remember something like Mofasa talking from beyond the grave. In fact, all these are great! [LasseGullvågSætre2]

Yo damianvila, check it out : I branded the sucker !
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Gutsy/Wallpaper#preview  --terlmann

    I really like this animal idea, in the release version could simply include Giraffe, blue elephant and lion and we would have enough for many tastes. <nowiki>[[vexorian]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

==== Borders ====

<nowiki>[[File:borders800x600.png]]</nowiki>

Kinda inspired by foresight, I think this one is nice, but it needs some more work.
I'll be happy to send you the .svg, just email me at lasse(at)sosialisme(dot)no.

  I like this better than the other :-) <nowiki>[[Damianvila]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:borders3-800.png]]</nowiki>

Evolved. A little more exciting, fixed the swoosh and lifted it a little. Scaled down ubuntu logo.
Full version 1650x1050 <nowiki>[[attachment:borders3-1680x.png|here]]</nowiki>
<nowiki>[[LasseGullvågSætre2]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

I left this project behind after it was slaughtered on #ubuntu-artwork :). Got something else up my sleeve now. Don't hesitate to tell me if there still is some interest for this wallpaper, I can finish it, and Ill upload the fixed resolutions. If you want the SVG, just email me. <nowiki>[[LasseGullvågSætre2]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>
    -- Fixed the resolution

--Hi Lasse, I don't understand why anyone would slaughter these images - I think they are wonderfull. Perhaps people have a problem with the similarities with the Forsight Linux wallpaper. I especially like the first and the last one. The middle one has great colour, but I'd like a little less "glare" on the upper part. I'm using the last one on my desktop now, but for it to be perfect the image could use some anti-aliasing. I would also like to have a version without the logo. BTW, where's the attachment page you mention, I couldn't find it.
=== Springer ===

Sorry for treating the wiki as a worklog, but I'm uploading a work in progress here, hoping to get some feedback. This is what I've done with vectors so far, it needs some bitmap-editing to get right.

Springer, version 3. Swishes made better, shine toned down, some swoosh edits and colour correction. Full version <nowiki>[[attachment:springer3-1680x.png|here]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:springer3dark-800x.png]]</nowiki>
Same as above, just added my own colours to it. I like it better this way, but bigger parts of the image is not pure ubuntu colour palette (its based on it). Full version <nowiki>[[attachment:springer3dark-1680x.png|here]]</nowiki>

==== _ ====

I originally made it for edubuntu. But i think i can render an ubuntu one if u people like it.It's called wire+edubuntu=wiredubuntu=wired+ubuntu!!Comments please.

<nowiki>[[File:wiredubuntu.png]]</nowiki>

i also got high res version.

Could you post a high res version somewhere or send it to me per email? <nowiki>[[KennethWimer]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

I like the wiredubuntu design. Using the low rez on a high rez screen with black background. Just looks neat. :-)   - Scorpuk.

==== Another Try ====
Here is another sequel with big prominent logo and...nothing else.I also uploaded both wiredubuntu.blend in the attachments. -Titon4

email me at twright@antimalwaresupport.co.uk if you want the .xcf's

==== Springer + Wiredubuntu ====

I made this combination when I was bored. It's just a blueprint for a better quality version which I'm going to make later. <nowiki>[[[Skiessi]]</nowiki>] <<DateTime>>

<nowiki>[[File:random.jpg]]</nowiki>
<nowiki>[[File:oldpalette.png]]</nowiki>
...Yeah, it fits. Kinda differs from the older ones..

+EDIT: This one looks good on my 19" cube screen when it's stretched to fit the whole desktop (4:3), but when I watch the same file/picture on a newer LCD display, I can see how low quality it really is... I'll make the better version as soon as I get some better hardware.

   ps. the loading time of this page is getting out of hand :/

==== Proposal to the desktop look ====
{{http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs19/f/2007/251/0/f/Ubuntu_Proposal_by_freakcode.png}}

Thats my proposal to a new Human look, while mantaining the original Human colors and icons. Its a theme using the new 'Aurora' GTK+ Engine and 'Blended' Metacity theme. The wallpaper is also by me, and its in SVG format so fits well on any resolution. *** This is not a mockup ***, its the real thing, as set on my GNOME theme preferences.

I think it solves the problem of Ubuntu desktop being too dark or too brown, using orange accents gives a much cleaner and fresh look. Aurora Engine and Blended metacity also adds more bevel/gradients to the interface, making it look more 3D, then more modern, and will suite better with upcoming Compiz 3D features for a new generation in desktop environments. - HenriqueFreakcode

I very much like the widgets on this theme but it really does lack some color. Adding a bit of the orange/brown look as seen in the previous stuff would still be needed to pep things up a bit. <nowiki>[[KennethWimer]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

I like the button and form look, but it should use a good window border cause one like that doesn't look nice, doesn't match the rest of the theme and I think it needs a selected color variation. I also hope it got orange highlights for mouse over on buttons. It also got a major problem and it is aurora, that engine looks nice but at least in my computer it is terribly slow. <nowiki>[[Vexorian]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

I stick to the opinion of HenriqueFreakcode and would like to say that with this theme I feel very comfortable using linux. It's more natural and eyecandy than ever! Here's my desktop:

<nowiki>[[File:aurora_theme@dilomo.png]]</nowiki>

Best regards,
Anton Kerezov a.k.a dilomo

I think that the <nowiki>[[http://gnomelook.org/content/show.php/show.php?content=56438|Aurora gtk-engine]]</nowiki> MUST be used in the new Human theme for Gusty, it fits perfectly with the Compiz 3D look, even if you use metacity you will have a great modern theme. - Nukeador

Here it's my idea:

GTK-engine: <nowiki>[[http://gnomelook.org/content/show.php/show.php?content=56438|Aurora]]</nowiki> modified with an orange look.

Wallpaper: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Gutsy/Wallpaper?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ubuntulionbrandedxl9_2.jpg|Lion wallpaper]]</nowiki>

Window-borders: <nowiki>[[http://themes.beryl-project.org/theme_details.php?id=32|Ubuntu-superhuman]]</nowiki> A human-like border theme.

<nowiki>[[attachment:gusty-aurora-lion-1280.jpg]]</nowiki>

==== Stripped Clean and Fresh Wallpaper ====
Its just fresh, not too bright, not too dark, simple, clean and stripped Wallpaper. I don't know if it fits in bill.
