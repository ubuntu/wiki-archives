[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:03:34] <toddc>    I believe most of you know that I (scott_ev) am only moderating meetings on a temporary basis.  I am not the team leader.  Our team leader, johnc4510, is taking some time off from moderating our meetings.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:03:41] <scott_ev> dbman63: this will be a great place to ask questions

[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:04:38] <toddc>    In an interview recorded on February 19 2010, Mark Shuttleworth revealed that a new light theme will replace the Human theme in Ubuntu 10.04. The Human theme has been the default theme in Ubuntu since the first release.

[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:06:06] <syn-ack>  wait
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:06:23] <dbman63>  I wondered after the MeeGo announcement if Dell was going to stop Moblin...
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:06:24] <syn-ack>  Dell and Cannonical lost their contract?
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:07:13] <toddc>     no just cutting back on linux offerings due to low volume
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:07:19] <dbman63>  I wanted one of those Mini 10v's (but couldn't bank it, [R]) :)

[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:10:40] <toddc>    check later for info and what they have been able to do

[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:10:56] <toddc>    http://tinyurl.com/yh8s4l6
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:11:06] <Odameyer> [R]: I looked into netbooks about a year ago
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:11:29] <Odameyer> [R]: I thought the same thing, touched the keyboard, put it back in the box.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:11:38] <[R]>      what sucks... is at the time i bougth it as a secondary computer
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:11:42] <[R]>      and nwo its turned into my primary
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:11:48] <[R]>      wonder if i should have gotten something with MORE substance
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:12:07] <toddc>    I loved mine so much I sold the first one and now have two
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:12:09] <Odameyer> [R]: I've got a beastly rig if you wanna buy it
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:12:31] <[R]>      Odameyer: i don't need a $4000 laptop
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:12:41] <[R]>      damn
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:12:43] <[R]>      speaking of android
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:12:47] <toddc>    they work fast enough on linux to make me happy
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:12:57] <[R]>      i was just out with someone who had an eris and i totaly forgot to ask to look at it
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:13:10] <toddc>    or hack it?
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:13:18] <Odameyer> 22" samsung, logitech 280 watt 5.1 surround sound, Nvidia GTX260, Intel Q9550 quadcore, 8gb of 1066mhz mushkin, 750 watt raidmax PSU, 1tb WD black, gigabyte EP45-UD3P
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:13:45] <toddc>    that will not fit in my motorcycle
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:14:04] <toddc>    Update of Installfest news
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:14:20] <toddc>    It has been noted that not many people have been making it to out installfests looking for help.  This is, perhaps, because there's no real advertising.  So a few of us got together and discussed options.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:14:25] <[R]>      Odameyer: talking about laptop
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:14:29] Quit       apple_ has left this server (Ping timeout: 260 seconds).
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:14:31] <Odameyer> oh...
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:14:34] <Odameyer> well I NEED my laptop
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:14:44] <[R]>      lol
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:14:55] <toddc>    What we came up with is adding another installfest at the Tempe Escalante Community Center on a trial (3 months) basis.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:15:08] <toddc>    This way The City of Tempe offers us 3 ways to get the word out:  via their newsletter that goes to every resident of Tempe, by adding us to the bulletin board on channel 11, and by adding us to the website for the city.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:15:20] <toddc>    We can get more advertising by putting fliers up at other city locations like schools, libraries, community centers, and other city facilities.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:15:23] <Odameyer> [R]: AMD sempron 2ghz, 3gb of RAM, 120gb hard drive, 2mp webcam, 15.4" glossy LCD
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:15:32] <toddc>    We went ahead and made arrangements because we were trying to get into the newsletter.  The manager of the Escalante Center thought we could get into it this quarter but he was wrong.  It's not a huge commitment so we went for it without team approval.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:15:41] <dbman63>  Mini 10v starts at $249, still posted @ Dell website http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/linux_3x?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:15:49] <toddc>    Please also note that this is a co-operative effort between PLUG and the AZ Loco and every effort is being made to keep it that way.  We want everyone to be informed and have an opportunity to add their input.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:16:05] <[R]>      Odameyer: i have like a celeron 2ghz with 2gb of ram...
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:16:05] <toddc>    So the schedule for installfests will be as follows for the next few months:  Feb 27th - UAT, Mar 20 - Escalante, Mar 27 - UAT, April 10 Escalante, April 24 - UAT, April 24 - Licid Release Party - Boulders, May 8 - Escalante, May 22 - UAT
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:16:13] <Odameyer> [R]: ewww
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:16:19] <toddc>    We have posted some flyers already and will be posting more  this week

[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:16:40] <syn-ack>  Speaking of installfests... has anyone heard anything from TFUG?

[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:17:39] <[R]>      toddc: i see no link for the flier on the forums...
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:17:48] <[R]>      toddc: and the last time i tried there was as link... but it woudn't let me view it
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:18:15] <toddc>    I will check it did work for me earlyer this week
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:18:28] <toddc>    There will be a 10.04 Lucid Lynx release party at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe (http://www.bouldersonbroadway.net/) on the 24th of April. Boulders on Broadway has a room upstairs that we will have all to ourselves.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:18:46] <scott_ev__>       Let me google a link for you
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:19:02] <toddc>    We'll have wifi access too.  It's going to be a good chance to eat some good grub, have a few drinks or brewski's and meet some of the other UbuGeeks that you have only met online. You're not going to want to miss this.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:19:15] <toddc>    Someone can pick out new features in 10.04 and present them or concentrate on one for example.  Anything to do with Ubuntu will be OK.  Things like how to navigate Launchpad and report bugs...
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:19:16] <dbman63>  Dell Netbook with Moblin offering: http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/ubuntu_moblin?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:19:24] <toddc>    Actually, if you have a favorite piece of software that you use you can present that even if it's not in Ubuntu's repos.  Please be thinking about this.  It will only make the Release Party more of a success.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:19:46] <toddc>    Here is a link to the Lucid Lynx planning page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/LucidLynx  Feel free to add to the ideas section or fill in anything that might be missing.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:19:58] <toddc>    We will be heading there from the monthly installfest at UAT. http://tinyurl.com/yemru26  If you've never been to an installfest at UAT, you may want to consider checking it out.  Our LoCo co-sponsors it with PLUG but we are poorly represented.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:20:10] <toddc>    There's a proposed flyer posted at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1388113 please give us your feedback in the form of a vote with coments if needed.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:20:33] <toddc>    it's a chance to help another linux user or, better yet, possibly install Linux an a computer that currently is running that other OS.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:20:43] <toddc>    http://azloco.com/node/120
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:20:55] <toddc>    I've started the making plans for our next instalfest in Tucson at the University.  Andrew Lenards made the necessary introductions to get the ball rolling and start communication between us ans the CS dept.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:21:04] <toddc>    So, it's time to start thinking about how we want to organize this event.  I'll need feedback from those of you that attended last time.  And I'm open to input.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:21:17] <toddc>    We'll need to do a lot of planning so we can put on a good show for all attendees.  Remember that the University called it a Windows Removal Event.  That's because the CS dept has migrated to Ubuntu Linux!
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:21:36] <xHans>    get that UofA spider to show up at the release party
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:21:36] <toddc>    I'd imagine they are wondering where we've been since they wanted us to schedule regular installfests.  This would be a great opportunity to promote Ubuntu Linux to students and the general public in Tucson.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:21:50] <toddc>    We'll need fliers, etc. etc. We'll need volunteers for a variety of duties so please please spread the word in channel and via email that we are calling for help.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:21:55] <xHans>    and Installfests at UofA
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:22:05] <toddc>    If no one else steps up and offers to be the main contact point and organizer I'll do it.  I would prefer to have someone, anyone living in Tucson volunteer to be the person to make face to face contact with our contacts on campus?  It's over 4 hours round trip for me if I need to drive down there.
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:22:19] <toddc>    This weekend hutchnate brought up the point that we need to set some guidelines about hardware requirements for different types of installs at an installfest.  There are regular installs, dual boot installs, Virtual Machine installs, and Wubi installs.  Apparently there was some issue with low powered machines and VM installs.  We really should avoid trying to run into this at the next...
[Sunday 21 February 2010] [21:22:20] <toddc>    ...installfest.
