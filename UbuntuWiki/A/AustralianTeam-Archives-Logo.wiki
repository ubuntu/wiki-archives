The AustralianTeam logo was chosen to be proposal #7, at the meeting on April 4th, 2006.

== Other Proposals ==

The official logo was decided to be number #7, at the meeting on April 4th, 2006. These proposals are only here for historical reference.

Note that launchpad uses a 16x16 pixel logo so scalability is important.

== Discussion ==

* #1 is based on the "Australian Made" trademark so there may be copyright issues.  -- DavidSymons
* I'd suggest creating something that ''reflects'' the Ubuntu logo, but doesn't actually ''use'' the Ubuntu logo itself. See the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/TrademarkPolicy|Trademark Policy]]</nowiki>. Good ways of doing this include using the tell-tale dots, the Ubuntu colours, etc. Perhaps we could make a Southern Cross with Ubuntu-style coloured dots? That might have a bit of a dot-painting feel about it too. :-) How about a Eureka flag/cross with a bit of Ubuntu influence? -- JeffWaugh
* If the Ubuntu logo does get used, replace the dots with faces, perhap an indigenous face, an Asian face and a European face?  -- Craige McWhirter
* I quite like the dot painting Australia, # 6. It also looks good and is still recognisable at a small size, while a lot of the others, eg stars on ubuntu logo, are not immediately recognisable at 16x16. -- MatthewVermeulen
* I too am a fan of the dot painting, perhaps reversing the colours so the darker colours are on the outside may make it more visible on a white background when smaller. -- NaamanCampbell
* 9-12 are obviously based on the erueka flag - svgs are available if needed -- AndrewEdwards
* I rather like the boomerang idea used in #8, though the dot artwork ones (#6 and #7) also look appealing. My vote would be for #8 though. :) -- PascalKlein
* I like 8 and 9, even though i had to edit the page to find it ;) KarlGoetz
* #8 is definitely the standout option here. It is clearly Australian yet still bears a close resemblance to the original Ubuntu logo. -- SridharDhanapalan
