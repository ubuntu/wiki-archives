==== Concept ====
This is my attempt at smooth shapes created using the "human" colors. I've avoided any sort of branding, and any bezier curves, shwoops, auroras etc. I made it using Paint.NET (something like "GIMP-Elements" for Windows). Unfortunately, I sized it at 1280x800 (my screen's rez), and exported it as a jpg; forgetting to keep the pdn file that has all the "steps" stored in it. If people like this thing, I hope someone with more skillz will make an svg, large png etc. -- lituuslimacon
