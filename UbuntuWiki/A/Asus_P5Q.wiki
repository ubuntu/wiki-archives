=== Asus_P5Q ===

This motherboard works perfectly on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy), but only if SATA is configured as AHCI in the BIOS (installation impossible via Alternate CD if SATA runs as IDE). Integrated LAN is not recognized (driver is missing). Best thing to do is to buy and install a PCI Wired Network Card.
