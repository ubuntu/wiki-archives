Dear Sir or Madam,

The Australian Ubuntu Local Community Team is an officially recognised Ubuntu team, dedicated to providing community support via mailing list and IRC. We also advocate the use of Ubuntu.

As part of our efforts, we have made successful contact with the Australian Personal Computer Magazine (APC) and will be providing them with information about the latest Ubuntu release. In doing so, we plan to mention the various support facilities available.

Since your business is mentioned in the Oceania section of the Ubuntu Marketplace, it will be among the facilities we will be mentioning.

This letter has been sent to you as a professional courtesy and to inform you of our actions.

We also wish to extend our sincere gratitude to you for supporting Ubuntu in Australia.

Sincerely,

The Australian Ubuntu Local Community Team.
