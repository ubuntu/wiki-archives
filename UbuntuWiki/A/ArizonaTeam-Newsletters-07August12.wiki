Announcements:

The Ubuntu US Teams project has implemented some new naming standards
for team wiki pages, launchpad pages, etc. Our team launchpad page did
not conform to the new standard, and so I have changed it. The new
address is: http://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-arizona  If you have this page
bookmarked, please change it to this new address.

We had three new members at the last meeting, and one visitor.
donchriscoe joined in from Flagstaff and has been involved with
computers since the mid 80's. Two months ago he decided to give linux a
try and choose Ubuntu. Our next new member was flux, who lives in
Tucson, and is a student. He has been using linux for a while now and is
involved with hardware and low level programming. Finally there is
Nateh, who is a systems administrator for SMP MS windows shops. Nate
lives in Tucson and started with Red Hat in 2003 and has been using some
form of Linux ever since. Our visitor this week was pak33m aka Jimmy.
Jimmy is from the Florida Team and installs web applications and servers
for a living. The team welcomes all and we look forward to getting know
you better.

Summary of the August 05, 2007 meeting:

We had formal introductions of the three new members to our Arizonza team that seems to be gaining  more members every week! Great work all, and keep it up.

The first item discussed was the newsletter team, which will be going under some new changes as we get more people and with Marty willing to help get some more meat into the newsletter. I (Jacob) will be getting into contact with Marty hopefully later this week and we can hash out ideas on how to expand the newsletter. And if any of you have any suggestions please email me at pman2440@gmail.com or you can catch me in the IRC channel under jacob2440.

We are putting the tax exemption status on the back burner. The 'National' team has tossed around ideas of how they can do it so every state could use the same number and have one large bank account. There would too much trouble and costs if we wanted to do it ourselves. So unfortunately this will minimize the amount of donations we receive. We can still do fund raisers and other means.

We are still working hard to get Team Approval and all members that are either new or have yet to do so, please look at the following links for our Local Ubuntu Team. The first site <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline/|Team Approval Outline]]</nowiki> is where you can see the goals that our group needs to meet in order to get team approval from the national Ubuntu group. The second site <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline/Resources/|Team Approval Resources]]</nowiki> is where you will find all the different areas we need people to volunteer to help get the local team ready for approval. Any help big or small would be appreciated.

We are also working on getting CD's and informational flyers out to people to spread the word about Ubuntu, SloggerKhan is going to try and have a prototype of the flyer ready by next week for the whole team to look at, comment on and see if that is something we want to use. And we are still in need of people to help burn CD's.

Thank you all for your help and support and lets keep up the good work. And remember about the new Launchpad page has moved locations so make sure to update your bookmarks!
