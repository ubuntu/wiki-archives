=== Ubuntu Lion ===
I nominate <nowiki>[[http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/338/ubuntulionbrandedxl9.jpg|this image]]</nowiki> for the Gutsy release.

The shining mane of a lion is captured by hunters and branded with the Ubuntu name and logo firmly in its center.

# The lion represents the highest in integrity, strength, and courage.
# Gold and orange are the combination of red and yellow, two of Ubuntu's primary colors.
# A lion's mane in dim lighting is rich in detail but not very distracting due to uniform texture.

* <nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntulionbrandedxl9_2.jpg|I adjusted the colors a bit]]</nowiki> =) --<nowiki>[[Skiessi]]</nowiki>
* +1 from me. I'm curious how this was made...I hope no animals were harmed in its making... --Durand
* I used gimp and fiddled with filters and the ubuntu svg logo. It was hard and took hours, but I did it...and I did it so it would be repeatable. If you want to borrow the "brand" you will find it <nowiki>[[http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/5672/ubuntubrandlr3.png|right here]]</nowiki>. --Terlmann
* I absolutely ''lurve'' the lion fur -- it's ''very'' warm and cuddly -- but I don't think any branding is required. I mean, the warm orange glow from the fur harmonises perfectly with the reds and oranges from the rest of the Ubuntu desktop. I think it's got Ubuntu written all over it without any sort of branding. --JeremyVisser
