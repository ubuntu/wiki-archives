 04:10 <Pscion> For those of you who've expressed interest in helping the Installfest web app, here's where we are currently: I'm currently troubleshooting page redirection on the server.

 04:10 <Icedm> +1

 04:11 <Pscion> I plan to make a fresh Debian VM with the same dependencies as the laptop that I have been developing on.

 04:11 <Pscion> I think I've forgotten a setting in one of the dependencies .

 04:12 <Pscion> Also, I will need SQL assistance, mostly on the conceptual level. I have data going in and out of the db to and from the web app, I just need to get the data stored in an efficient, sensible way.

 04:13 <toddc> See any team member for access to the blogs and any that should be moved to the front page let us know about it.

 04:14 <toddc> LINUX QUOTES/JOKES

 04:14 <toddc> Linus Torvalds entry in Encyclopedia Galactica

 04:14 <toddc> Torvalds, Linus- ... historians generally agree was an actual person and completed a large portion of the programming used to develop the positronic brain sometime before the earliest recorded history.

 04:14 <toddc> A number of programs have been copied from active positronic memory and have been proven to be based on the galactic standard programming language VM (vit-min) C.

 04:14 <toddc> The memory patterns include references to the genetic programmer Linus (la-news) Pauling and have revealed where Torvalds named the earliest cores of the positronic brain for the VM C language.

 04:15 <toddc> Torvalds is universally regarded by historians as the greatest linguist of the core development project.

 04:15 <toddc> Torvalds was known to have mastered all of the known languages of the time while working in an advanced development laboratory called the Swiss (s-weex) Patent Office of Pari (par-ee)

 04:15 <toddc> and selected the VM C core in preference to the previous Finn language from predecessors Norway (Turbo-C) and Sweden

 04:15 <toddc> (ANSI-C). Torvald's mastery of the language in the VM C core is regarded galaxy wide as the reason for the estimated 100,000 year uptime for the original positronic brains.

 04:16 <toddc> The X Law of Robotics burned into all positronic brains has been found still undecoded in currently functioning examples of the oldest portion of the memory used by the LinuX kerning (coy-nah).

 04:16 <toddc> Historians are unanimous in identifying Torvalds as the most ingenious programmer in galactic history.
