 04:14 <toddc> 12/28 (Christmas weekend)

 04:14 <toddc> Canceled meetings

 04:14 <toddc> Several members are planning to give talks at the Computer Technology Conference. http://comptechconf.com

 04:15 <toddc> February 19 20 invitation also have a installfest that week-end and Scale is that week-end also

 04:15 <toddc> If anyone would like to give a talk or presentation or assist let us know.

 04:15 <toddc> We have ordered a ubuntu conf pack so that we will have some swag to hand out and we might be interested in running a booth also.

 04:15 <toddc> http://comptechconf.com and have invited PLUG to attend

 04:16 <toddc> programmer317: do we have a confermation on the conf pack?

 04:16 <programmer317> Yes.   I have it.

 04:16 <toddc> I am requesting money from Ubuntu community to cover booth fees and should know soon on that. Thanks to programmer317 for the assistance with this.

 04:16 <toddc> yes thank you!!

 04:16 <wmack> do we know when they start accepting papers?

 04:17 <toddc> dates and time are now open

 04:17 <wmack> (not the green type..)

 04:17 <toddc> so as I understand it first come for best time slots

 04:18 <toddc> And if we get a booth we will need to staff it Thursday Friday and Saturday.

 04:18 <toddc> we also discussed not having a installfest that week end inorder to devote full time to the conf

 04:19 <toddc> For those presenting CTC would like a Picture a topic and a overveiw

 04:19 <toddc> to be used for promoting your presentations. Most time slots are free and first come for best times.

 04:19 <toddc> We also have a invatation to share a booth with Plug at the

 04:19 <toddc> http://chandlerepicfest.com/ February 7 2015 in downtown Chandler

 04:19 <toddc> We have had a donation of 200+dvd's with sleeves so we should be able to make lots of dvd's for all the events ( another project)

 04:20 <wmack> I would support NOT having an installfest when the CTC happens - just spreading ourselves too thin

 04:20 <programmer317> They said install fest would be ok.   Most conf attendees will be leaving at noon Sat.
