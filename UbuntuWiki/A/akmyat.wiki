== About Aung Kaung Myat ==

Hello,I am Aung Kaung Myat from Myanmar who love Ubuntu.I enjoy helping other students like me who have difficulties to start using Ubuntu.

I am currently studying at ''' <nowiki>[[http://uit.edu.mm|UIT (University of Information Technology, Yangon)]]</nowiki> '''. I am interested in computer, especially Networking and System Administration. I love Linux and FOSS.

I first learn about Ubuntu from Ubuntu 15.10 Festival held by <nowiki>[[MyanmarTeam|Ubuntu Myanamar LoCo Team]]</nowiki>. I began interested in Linux and start using Ubuntu. From that day on, I fall in love with Ubuntu and it became my favorite Linux Distro.

At first I have a lot of troubles. Our loco team helps to solve my problems and learn more about Ubuntu.  I love to help and share experience with other beginners who wants to use Ubuntu. So, I join Ubuntu Myanmar Loco Team and now contributing as a volunteer.
