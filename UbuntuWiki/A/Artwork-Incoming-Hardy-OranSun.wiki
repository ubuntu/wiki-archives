== Synopsis ==

 {{http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/383625983_a6ea464a6a_m.jpg}}

This is the central page for the development of the '''oransun theme''', organized by <nowiki>[[Lizardking]]</nowiki>.
The theme is a proposal for the "feisty" '''7.04''' version. I hope it will be stored in the feisty release, just like blubuntu and the other. Just installing it through apt.
The theme try to follow the implementation of a orange base color combined with the most innovation gtk-engines, '''Murrine'''.

=== GTK ===

I use the innovative '''Gtk Engine Murrine''' to agglomerate all the orange smooth color.
Reason: Beta Freeze is far so we can put murrine engines into feisty schedule. Furthermore the murrine engines is the  fastest engines bu the way, it is shiny beautiful.
