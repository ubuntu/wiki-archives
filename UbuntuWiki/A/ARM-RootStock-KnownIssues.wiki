* mono assembly installation hangs under qemu-arm-static
   If you're running !RootStock as root in a x86 machine, you can't install any mono packages (or any seed that depends on mono) otherwise you're going to face this bug. See bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu-kvm/+bug/530000|#530000]]</nowiki> for more information.
* qemu: Unsupported syscall: 335
   Depending on your qemu version this message can fill your log, but it shouldn't be a problem.
* qemu-system-arm segfaults while running second stage
   This happens quite frequently when you're using full emulation (running !RootStock as user). See bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/604872|#604872]]</nowiki> for more information.
* !RootStock hangs while running second stage
   This is another Qemu issue that happens when running with full emulation. Check bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/qemu-kvm/+bug/532733|#532733]]</nowiki> for more information.
* Language-pack handling is not implemented yet, please install the packages for your language manually post install.
