=== Current Issues ===
=== Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition ===
Battery monitor software erroneously reports critical low power and intends to hibernate.
Work around: Click cancel and it will correct the indication. But you have to maintain awareness of the power level to know if it's erroneous.

Multi-in-one card reader not detected. This issue was apparently fixed in Natty Narwhal.

The built in mic did not work but I fixed it by downloading a program. I will try to backtrack and figure out what it was.
