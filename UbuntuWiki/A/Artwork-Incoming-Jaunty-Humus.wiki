== Humus ==

''Humus'' is a latin word for ''earth'', from where the word ''human'' derives.

=== Concept ===

The idea is to develop a Graphic User Experience solution from the ground up. And this means developing the theme, iconset, splashscreens and GUI.

Ubuntu has the need to appear as a rock solid OS, with a characteristic, slick, elegant and professional look and feel, keeping a simple, strong and cohese construction.

'''Developers and Beta-testers are needed to this project, please contact me if you want to help me out!'''

==== Reference ====

Mockups to be developed.
