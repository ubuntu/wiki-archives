 04:12 <Ron_A> I took some time this week to look at Phoenix Linux. It is based on Ubuntu 16.04 and is a Lubuntu distro.

 04:12 <Ron_A> The office suite at install is google docs and it is setup more as an easy way to google your life than as an open source option.

 04:12 <Ron_A> The menu/start button opens a new screen with the usual menu things.

 04:13 <Ron_A> The installed browser is chromium and crashes at opening.

 04:12 <RexB> Ron_A you have an announcement

 04:12 <Ron_A> I took some time this week to look at Phoenix Linux. It is based on Ubuntu 16.04 and is a Lubuntu distro.

 04:12 <Ron_A> The office suite at install is google docs and it is setup more as an easy way to google your life than as an open source option.

 04:12 <Ron_A> The menu/start button opens a new screen with the usual menu things.

 04:13 <Ron_A> The installed browser is chromium and crashes at opening.

 04:13 <Ron_A> The install screens are about cublinux and the links to it are dead.

 04:13 <Ron_A> Overall I found it to be lacking compared to my Xubuntu daily driver or any of my mainstream Vms.

 04:13 <Ron_A> Thanks MajB

 04:12 <RexB> Ron_A you have an announcement

 04:12 <Ron_A> I took some time this week to look at Phoenix Linux. It is based on Ubuntu 16.04 and is a Lubuntu distro.

 04:12 <Ron_A> The office suite at install is google docs and it is setup more as an easy way to google your life than as an open source option.

 04:12 <Ron_A> The menu/start button opens a new screen with the usual menu things.

 04:13 <Ron_A> The installed browser is chromium and crashes at opening.

 04:13 <Ron_A> The install screens are about cublinux and the links to it are dead.

 04:13 <Ron_A> Overall I found it to be lacking compared to my Xubuntu daily driver or any of my mainstream Vms.

 04:13 <Ron_A> Thanks MajB

 04:12 <RexB> Ron_A you have an announcement

 04:12 <Ron_A> I took some time this week to look at Phoenix Linux. It is based on Ubuntu 16.04 and is a Lubuntu distro.

 04:12 <Ron_A> The office suite at install is google docs and it is setup more as an easy way to google your life than as an open source option.

 04:12 <Ron_A> The menu/start button opens a new screen with the usual menu things.

 04:13 <Ron_A> The installed browser is chromium and crashes at opening.

 04:13 <Ron_A> The install screens are about cublinux and the links to it are dead.

 04:13 <Ron_A> Overall I found it to be lacking compared to my Xubuntu daily driver or any of my mainstream Vms.

 04:13 <Ron_A> Thanks MajB

 04:14 <RexB> Roger that.  Interesting
