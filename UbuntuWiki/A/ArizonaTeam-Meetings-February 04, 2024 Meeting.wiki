 04:10 <toddc> Great job stephenm! Thank You

 04:10 <MajB> Thank you stephenm

 04:10 <stephenm> welcome

 04:10 <toddc> Is there any other news we missed?

 04:10 <toddc> We are still getting lots of hits on azloco.org since we started posting articles and would like to continue to add articles.

 04:11 <toddc> See any administrator for access to the blogs and any that should be moved to the front page let us know about it.

 04:11 <toddc> LINUX QUOTES/JOKES

 04:11 <toddc> There are two major products of Berkeley, CA -- LSD and UNIX. We don't believe this to be strictly by coincidence.

 04:11 <toddc> Linux is like a wigwam

 04:11 <toddc> no windows, no gates

 04:11 <toddc> and an apache inside

 04:11 <toddc> dancing samba.

 04:12 <toddc> Linux never manages to become the most installed operating system! As often as we have to reinstall Windows ...

 04:12 <toddc> The goal is not world domination,

 04:12 <toddc> but that would be nice.
