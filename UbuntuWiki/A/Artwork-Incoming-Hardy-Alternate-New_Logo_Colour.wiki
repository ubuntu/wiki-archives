=== Concept ===
Saw the idea for orange to maroon/red gradient on wiki somewhere. Just a thumb sample. Looks good on black and dark brown. Working on glass effect and edge glow.

* This is a pretty cool design! -- Lmessenger  
* Hi, I like the look I'am new to the whole ubuntu artwork but I am hoping to contribute and I thought I would make a logo theme from scratch as there are certain things I like from other and different icon themes, I just can't find one the fits me best. Anyways I liked your logo and have used it in my first icon. I havn't subbmitted yet but when the first icon is finished I will get it on. Thanks -- The One and only Mr, Furlow == Attachment List ==
