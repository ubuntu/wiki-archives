== Herdy Wallpaper ==

Here's a suggestion for a dark wallpaper for Herdy. I've used the old Gusty wallpaper.
Maybe this isn't the best example, but I think it's very important that a new version of Ubuntu looks like Ubuntu. With changes of course, but some elements has to stay.

Sorry for the large image - couldn't make the thumb thing work!

This is a very nice wallpaper, can you make this for more resolutions? Specifically 1680x1050 in my case :) --Dutchy
