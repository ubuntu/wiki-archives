 04:23 <toddc> FUTURE EVENTS

 04:23 <toddc> Any thoughts on other events or projects???

 04:23 <MajB> There is a meeting of the Mountain View Computer Users Group on 14 June at the FairField Inn in Sierra Vista 0900-1200.  I will attend but it is mainly a bunch of Apple folks.

 04:24 <MajB> I haven't given up on SV yet.

 04:24 <turbidtux> I wonder what they are charged to meet there?

 04:24 <toddc> MajB: would you like to take some contact info /pr stuff let me know

 04:24 <FernHans> MajB: take some FreeBSD CDs :)

 04:25 <turbidtux> and Darwin...

 04:25 <TuxMann> One project related to the Sunday night meetings. I think we could use something for automating the meeting news, events, jobs posting.

 04:25 <toddc> FernHans: over to you for the plug events-news

 04:25 <FernHans> toddc: danke

 04:25 <FernHans> this Thursday is the PLUG east side meeting

 04:25 <FernHans> http://www.phxlinux.org/

 04:25 <FernHans> also this Thursday there's a new Red Hat Users Group starting

 04:25 <FernHans> the first event is teaming up iwth other groups for a presentation on OpenStack

 04:25 <FernHans> http://www.meetup.com/PhoenixRedHatSoftwareUserGroup/

 04:26 <FernHans> Stammtisch is a week from Tuesday

 04:26 <FernHans> that's it from me

 04:26 <toddc> FernHans: Thank you for the extra info

 04:26 <FernHans> bitte

 04:27 <toddc> that is all I have any other comments---ideas how to automate news and meetings?

 04:28 <TuxMann> My original idea was to have something that just copied from a document & pasted it into the IRC channel.

 04:29 <TuxMann> It would be good to have a pause and play feature as well in case a discussion gets started or pausing for comments.

 04:29 <toddc> I would need to retake FernHans scripting class :)

 04:29 <turbidtux> Have you created a dropbox, an email address so anyone can contribute news?

 04:29 <MajB> toddc:  I attended their meeting in May and there was only one lady even remotely interested in Linux.  I thought I would attend again and try once more.

 04:30 <toddc> we have several email address that I never have time to check like questions@azloco.com and not been to our FB site in almost a year

 04:31 <MajB> Not sure if handouts are appropriate yet.  I gave my info as contact.

 04:31 <toddc> MajB: correct it takes a while  to consider learning somthing new

 04:31 <MajB> I can always use email address of the bosses.

 04:31 <toddc> if all you ever used or know is winders

 04:32 <turbidtux> I was thinking an email like submit news@...

 04:33 <toddc> but often a show and tell and regular hearing about alt OS's  will spread interest

 04:33 <MajB> Good point.

 04:33 <toddc> turbidtux: it will also need a way to discard duplicates

 04:33 <toddc> or preused news

 04:33 <MajB> What have you got that would be a good quick down and dirty

 04:34 <turbidtux> Team Leader Review  ; )

 04:36 <toddc> I will email you a few flyers incase anyone asks but watching you use linux is usually the very best way most windows user have no idea anyone uses linux or what it can do or event better

 04:36 <toddc> turbidtux: same as I do now:)

 04:37 <MajB> Great.  These are Apple guys and gals.  Windows was not even discussed in May.

 04:38 <toddc> what was the last apple virus?

 04:38 <MajB> No idea.  Never used it

 04:38 <toddc> linux can run older apple computers

 04:38 <MajB> Yes

 04:38 <turbidtux> iOS...

 04:39 <toddc> FREE no expensive software

 04:39 <MajB> Yeah they talk funny as well

 04:40 <toddc> cheaper than a new apple computer too

 04:40 <MajB> Hey you are preaching to the choir.  I've been on Linux since 2008

 04:40 <toddc> #endmeeting
