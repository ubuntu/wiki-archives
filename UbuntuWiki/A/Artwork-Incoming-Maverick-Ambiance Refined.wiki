=== Comments ===
'''Comment:''' I vote this should be on the Natty CD! - it's got to be one of the highest qualety themes ive seen in (ever?) a long time. I think it should even go as far a the Default 'Light' theme. I do hope some high-up packagers see this, you need to file a bug with the tag "needs-packaging", a brief description and a link both here, and to the theme's website.
