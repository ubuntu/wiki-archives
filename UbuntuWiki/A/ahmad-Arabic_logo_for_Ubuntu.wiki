__TOC__

Currently there is only an official logo for Ubuntu in which its name is written in Latin letters, and its slogan is written in English.

While local teams have localised versions of the logo and slogan, having a standard, official logo where the name is written in Arabic letters will increase its adoption in the Arabic-speaking world, and affirm the ''locality'' spirit which is an integral part of the community. This is because Arabic look different than the Latin letters most European languages are written in.

This is a proposal to adopt an official logo for Ubuntu in Arabic, the main part of which could be used as is for many other languages that are written in Arabic script, or with little modification (mainly removing the hamza?)

It also adopts a translation of the strap line into Arabic, which if translated back into English woud say "Linux for normal people": لينكس للناس العاديين

You can see the proposed logo at <nowiki>[[http://ahmad.gharbeia.org/files/ubuntu-logo-motto-ar.svg]]</nowiki> (with strap line); and <nowiki>[[http://ahmad.gharbeia.org/files/ubuntu-logo-ar.svg]]</nowiki> (without strap line).

The issue of transliteration is an extended one. However the transliteration adopted in the proposed logo satisfies the following:
* using waw vowels و (instead of hypothetical damma diacritics on the consonants) it most closely corresponds to the pronunciation of "ubuntu" where the [U]s are long vowels.
* has a distinctive look which similar to the visual effect of the repetitive Us in the name in Latin.
* it provides for enough horizontal length to compensate for the horizontal density of this particular composition of letters when compared to its vertical height. The visual result of this is visually better than having to stretch the letters which will distort them, or to increase the kerning/tracking, which will not be easy on the eye of an Arabic reader.
* it is the most common form in writing among Arabic speakers (see <nowiki>[[http://ar.wikipedia.org/wikiأوبونتو|Arabic wikipedia article]]</nowiki>) and/or Google for أوبونتو and other variations like أبنتو

The design of the letters attempts to preserve the look of the Latin Ubuntu-Title typeface, specially with the round endings and smooth feel.

=== More on transliteration ===
The first concern when creating an Arabic logo is transliteration of the name. While this is true in any language, it is more emphasised in Arabic since it is written in a <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script|script]]</nowiki> which basically doesn't mark vowels. To be more precise, three long vowels exist and are marked by three corresponding semi-vowel letters. Short vowels are marked with diacritics, which while being an integral part of the writing system in its complete form, are usually omitted in handwriting.

Consequently the public transliteration tendency has been toward marking all vowels in foreign words with long vowels which could result in distorting the names. This is attested even among languages which use similar writing systems, like for example Arabic and Hebrew, where extra vowels are added when transliterating, both ways.
