=== Summary ===
A dialog should be diplayed to ask the user for downloading packages to complete localization.
=== Rationale ===
Because of the space lack on ubuntu desktop CD, There is no full localization for Firefox, Gimp and Openoffice. Some users have learnt english but they can't read, either because they don't speak english enough or, because it requires more effort. Some users don't speak english at all. Moreover the applications which aren't localized are major ones. That's why these users will click "System" then "Quit...". These users make the major part...
=== Use cases ===
* Élodie is a french user who wants to discover ubuntu. She launch a ubuntu desktop cd '''without''' this feature. She see that firefox, a piece of software she loves, is in english. She clicks "Système" then "Quitter...".
* Juan is a spanish user who wants to discover ubuntu. He launch a ubuntu desktop cd '''with''' this feature. A dialog apears asking him for downloading localization completition. He sees a fantastic desktop. He clicks "Instalar".
=== Design ===
<nowiki>[[http://img157.imageshack.us/my.php?image=automatedlocalization21nq.png|How I think we could design it]]</nowiki>.
=== Implementation ===
I think this would be very easy, flexible and lightweight to implement : A simple python script would  be enough.
==== Code ====

=== Outstanding issues ===
The best would be this dialog apears on the desktop of desktop live CD but that would use too much bandwidth on the servers if users do it every time they use the CD.
So I think we should show a notification on the desktop saying that there is localization pour Firefox, Gimp and Openoffice and, if an internet connection is detected, asking them for downloading while warming them about the server bandwith consumtion a little time after the desktop started. Then, on installaton, if an internet connection is detected, and if the loaclization haven't been downloaded before, It should be downloaded automatically. Then, If an it hasn't been downloaded yet, it should be a deamon waiting for an internet connection that would desactive after loaclization have been downloaded.
What do you think of that ?
=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

NB : If i'm not writing good english, could somebody fix it please ?

I think it would save much more bandwidth if anyone could download localised CD's. It should be possible to package them automatically. This should be done at least for the worlds main languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German (maybe in an other order because there are more german users than chinese users)

Julien Hémono - It's a bit like Mandriva One (a french distro) which count about 5 cds each for a geographic region with the languages there's there. But wouldn't it be confusing for the user and make CD  download and shiping harder because of the big number of CDs ?
