[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:02:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	i've been overwhelmed lately
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:02:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	sorry, but family first
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:02:56] <kennymc0>	it's no problem at all
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:03:00] <tyche>	As it should be
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:03:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	mom's doing better, but she has a bit to go yet
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:03:27] Join	SchleppHans has joined this channel (n=lufthans@ip68-231-183-37.tc.ph.cox.net).
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:03:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	thx to tyche for filling in
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:03:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:03:34] <azteech>	ltns johnc4510-laptop
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:03:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:03:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	SchleppHans: how many nicks you got   lol
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:04:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	go thing he doesn't cloak
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:04:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, where was i
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:04:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:04:20] <SchleppHans>	johnc4510-laptop: almost enough
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:04:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:04:33] <tyche>	One for every un-birthday.
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:04:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	we still need an installfest
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:04:50] <kennymc0>	yep
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:04:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	i suppose that should be first up
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:05:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	any thoughts on a date?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:05:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	should we now wait until after the first of yr?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:05:51] <Thugal>	after christmas so we can get all the people with new hardware?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:05:54] <kennymc0>	i would think so
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:05:55] <tyche>	That might be an idea.  We need time for advertising
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:06:11] <kennymc0>	most people are going to be gone and we arent going to have enough time to get things together for anything sooner than that
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:06:28] <azteech>	would be best, after the new year, IMHO
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:06:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, i'm tied up until the 4th of jan.
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:07:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	the 8th or 15 or 22
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:07:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:07:11] <azteech>	does anyone know what show stoppers still remain, OS wise that could hurt us?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:07:12] <kennymc0>	probably should wait till february or something like that so we have enough time to advertise and plan everything out
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:07:39] <kennymc0>	i've noticed that most of the things that were bugging me with my setup have pretty much been ironed out
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:07:46] <tyche>	azteech: PulseAudio.  Hee hee
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:07:48] <kennymc0>	if not have completely been fixed
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:07:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:08:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	seems like the no boot problem is a bios reset
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:08:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	from what i've seen
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:08:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	anyone heard when +1 is due out??
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:08:48] <Thugal>	yeah, if you use pidgin and want to run pulseaudio, you need to set pidgin to use alsa or the memory leak will crash apps
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:08:56] <SchleppHans>	azteech: the upgrade keeps resetting my machine right now?  :(
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:09:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	SchleppHans: resetting as in rebooting?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:09:29] <SchleppHans>	johnc4510-laptop: as in shutting down, so yes
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:09:33] <azteech>	still won't recognize my video card on mine, so have backed off ...
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:09:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	gad
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:09:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	that's not good
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:09:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: what card?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:09:58] <azteech>	7300 gt
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:10:04] <johnc4510-laptop>	hmmm
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:10:13] <kennymc0>	we might need to wait till 8.10.1 comes out or something
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:10:17] <azteech>	haven't been able to figure out why either ...
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:10:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	i know it's working with the FX5500 and 8600GT cards
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:10:35] <kennymc0>	cause a lot of the problems that have been fixed will still cause problems until they update
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:10:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	kennymc0: true
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:11:08] <azteech>	agree with kennymc0, until a .1 comes out, we could do more harm, than good
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:11:18] <Thugal>	do we want to just push the LTS install?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:11:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so before we set the date, we want to find out when .1 comes out  ????
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:11:28] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:11:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	we still have LTS cds too btw
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:11:39] <kennymc0>	that would be a very good idea
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:11:52] <azteech>	LTS would definitely not be a detrement
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:11:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	i decided to keep them around instead of trying to get rid of them
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:12:10] <kennymc0>	we should still wait till 8.10.1 and then offer both and give people options
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:12:24] <kennymc0>	get rid of a few more cds
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:12:38] <azteech>	what I recommend is that we do the fest with the LTS, but mention the new 8.10.
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:12:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so first off we need a date for .1
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:12:59] <kennymc0>	and we can be lite on the number of cds that we make and bring a computer with the isos on it and burn them as we need them
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:13:30] <kennymc0>	that way we dont end up with a stack of extra burned cds like i have
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:13:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	nods
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:13:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	if
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:13:54] <azteech>	well, we could also make boot flash drives for the 8.10.1, if that is out. Would cut down on the number of cd's we would need to have
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:14:04] <johnc4510-laptop>	true
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:14:16] <kennymc0>	well we would want to still have cds there if they want to take them with them
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:14:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, i'll check with some contacts and see when .1 is due out
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:14:35] <kennymc0>	and not all computers can boot off of flash drives
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:14:37] <SchleppHans>	for my Intrepid presentation I installed via USB drive during the presentation
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:14:42] <azteech>	agreed, but, that can be done on the spot, if we have the iso's ready to burn ...
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:14:51] <azteech>	agreed, not all can
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:14:55] <johnc4510-laptop>	the last time i looked at the intrepid schedule page it wasn't listed
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:15:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	SchleppHans: nice
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:15:12] <azteech>	nice ..
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:15:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	SchleppHans: how big a flash drive does it take
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:15:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	2 or 3 gig?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:15:45] <kennymc0>	should fit no problem on a 1GB
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:15:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah ok
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:15:58] <kennymc0>	but if you want persistent changes then it will need to be bigger
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:03] <tyche>	I thought it took 4 for a LiveUSB
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:19] <kennymc0>	i've installed it on a 1GB stick before
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	hmmm
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:33] Quit	Siph0n has left this server ("Leaving").
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:33] <azteech>	heard it takes two for install, but 4 for live
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:34] <kennymc0>	4 would be about what you would want for persistent changes
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:35] Join	LuftHans has joined this channel (n=lufthans@ip68-231-183-37.tc.ph.cox.net).
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:49] Quit	SchleppHans has left this server (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)).
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:55] <Thugal>	and that you can upgrade if you want after installing LTS
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:56] <Thugal>	dev say probably no 8.10.1
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:16:58] <Thugal>	http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/15141
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:17:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	1. date on .1      2. wiki for flashdrive install
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:17:16] <tyche>	I've got an 8 gig, and it is about half full with the LiveUSB
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:17:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	Thugal: thx
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:17:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	well that would be a first
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:17:42] <kennymc0>	probalby just how the tool that intrepid uses works
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:17:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	we've always had .1
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:06] <tyche>	That was just for a normal install.  This is the LiveCD in USB form
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	i know there are instructions around for installing to a flash
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:39] <kennymc0>	intrepid comes with a new little fancy tool for making bootable flash drives
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:43] <kennymc0>	it's really cool
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche made one i think
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:56] <azteech>	near the bottom of the page that Thugal just put up says probably no .1
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:18:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: ^^^^
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:19:04] <tyche>	System -> Administration -> Create a USB startup disk
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:19:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: is that the whole os or just a recovery disk?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:19:46] <tyche>	That's the whole LiveCD
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:19:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	and what size flash did you put it on
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:20:03] <tyche>	You have to have the ISO to start with, and it does the rest.
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:20:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	cool
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:20:15] <tyche>	I put it on an 8 gig Flash drive
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:20:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	any idea how much room it took up?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:20:38] <tyche>	Hold on
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:20:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	Mr. wizard
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:20:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:20:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	hanging on
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	hanging on
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:04] <johnc4510-laptop>	hanging on
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	oh no mr. bill
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:19] <LuftHans>	LiveUSB takes the same room as a LiveCD, so 700 MB
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	cool
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:46] <tyche>	It says that I have 2.9 gig free
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:49] <LuftHans>	you can allow more room for saving changes if you want and have space
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:55] <johnc4510-laptop>	k
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:21:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	thx tyche
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:22:07] <kennymc0>	the tool gives you different options to give you the chance for persistent changes which means that you can run on it and install programs and they will still be there the next time you start it up
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:22:24] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:22:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:22:35] <azteech>	be nice to have one large enough that you could carry around some repo stuff with it .... lol

[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:23:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	i saw a 16g flash advertised today   i think it was about 50
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:23:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	Mauricio: greetings
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:23:32] <Mauricio>	Hello, I am sorry to be too late
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:23:33] <Thugal>	zareason's 30 gig ubuntu live usb's seem pretty reasonable.  have 2 coming in mail tomorrow
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:23:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	np
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:23:39] <tyche>	Yep.  My 8 gig was about $30
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:23:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:24:19] <tyche>	And that was at BestBuy
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:24:44] <kennymc0>	bestbuy is usually overpriced
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:24:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	so, lets shoot for late January for now. We can adjust if needed  ?????
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:24:47] <azteech>	looked at some the other day at best buy, and they were still at $30
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:25:09] 	 * kennymc0 is making a usb disk now
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:25:24] <Mauricio>	johnc4510-laptop: the meeting is running?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:25:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	???
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:25:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	Mauricio: yep
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:25:47] 	 * kennymc0 means the live usb disk thinger using the tool in intrepid
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:25:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	we're talking about installfest
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:25:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	re-planning
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:26:07] <Mauricio>	Ok, thanks
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:26:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	looking at late jan. or early feb.
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:26:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	for now
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:27:05] <LuftHans>	if you want to get people with new gifts early in Jan would likely be better
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:27:09] <azteech>	will they be having finals in january, or should that be over by dend of Dec?
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:27:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	not sure
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:27:29] <kennymc0>	that's usually over before xmas
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:27:36] <kennymc0>	at least from what i've seen
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:27:45] <LuftHans>	azteech: HS in Jan, college in Dez
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:27:54] <LuftHans>	I think
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:27:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	sounds right
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:28:17] <kennymc0>	i know my little brother has his finals before xmas break
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:28:25] <kennymc0>	and he's in hs
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:28:31] 	 * kennymc0 is not talking about word
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:28:35] <azteech>	K, then early to mid January shouldn't be bad then ... especially, as LuftHans pointed out, we want to gt those with new toys involved ...
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:28:46] <kennymc0>	yep
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:28:55] <kennymc0>	new toys are always a good thing
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:28:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	we could shoot for the 10th or 17th of Jan
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:29:04] 	 * kennymc0 wishes he could afford new toys
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:29:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	????????????
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:29:31] <azteech>	17th probably good, gives eveyone chance to settle back into routines, and get holidays out of their heads
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:29:32] <LuftHans>	don't forget to tell people about OLPC sale
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:29:48] <kennymc0>	yeah 17th sounds good to me
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:29:57] <tyche>	OK
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:30:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, lets shoot for that then
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:31:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	sorry brain blockage
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:31:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:31:33] <kennymc0>	yeah proximity to tyche can do that
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:31:38] <kennymc0>	lol
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:31:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	i had thought of something today about the event, but i can't remember what it was
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:31:50] <azteech>	okay, the next thing I guess would be location confirmations....
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:31:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	it was a good idea too
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:31:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:32:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	my department
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:32:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	if we are firm on that date i'll ask them
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:32:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	ASU and U of A
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:32:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:32:55] <kennymc0>	sounds good to me
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:33:13] <tyche>	OK
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:33:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	on a side note, i know slofgren got the server going
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:33:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	just need to get it into the facility
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:33:40] <tyche>	I think he's still waiting for the information on the contact at DeVry
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:33:50] <LuftHans>	he got contact info
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:33:51] <kennymc0>	that's what i heard
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:33:57] <azteech>	IMHO, if we wait much later than the 17th, I feel we run into issue of trying to work on getting installfest out of the way, too close to the next sched release in April and the much needed planning we will be needing to do for it.
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:34:00] <tyche>	Ah.  I didn't know
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:34:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah, that would be david hol???
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:34:29] <kennymc0>	he said that he sent him an email but hasnt heard back
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:34:36] <kennymc0>	but i heard that from him a while ago
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:34:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	LuftHans: what's daves name with DeVry??
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:34:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	hol something
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:34:55] <LuftHans>	Huerta
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:34:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:35:03] <LuftHans>	slofgren has his contact info
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:35:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah ok

[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:48:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	part of the problem was i was at the hospital and no cell phones on there

[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:48:55] <tyche>	I hear that
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:48:56] <azteech>	yep, hospitals and cell phones don't mix well ...
[Sun Nov 30 2008] [21:49:02] <LuftHans>	tyche: at one job they insisted on having my phone number, my response was "the one I don't answer or the one I don't turn on" :)
