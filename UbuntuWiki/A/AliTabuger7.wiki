My launchpad profile is: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~edb82189]]</nowiki>

My name is Evan Boldt. I enjoy the flexibility of using Ubuntu on a daily basis. I use it for many things, but mainly to help me develop my website (<nowiki>[[http://neomenlo.org|NeoMenlo.org]]</nowiki>).

<nowiki>[[[http:--neomenlo.org|NeoMenlo.org]]</nowiki> is designed to be a completely free community for invention help. I do this by using open source principals, but also allowing the members to keep their unrestricted rights to their own inventions. By helping each other, a wider variety of skills, knowledge, creativity, and abilities are available to the inventors.

I try to give back to the open source community, so I also help out wherever I can with the open source CMS Drupal.
