Keywords: Light silk-like feeling. Warm, soft, relaxing.

=== Concept ===
I recall Mark Shuttleworth talking about what he liked in so much in the Dapper splash screen. Among the things I recall are:
* Subtle brush strokes, giving a textured look
* Burnt edges
* Encased in a layer of glass

A link to his actual words would be good, but I lack one for now. In any case, let's give him what he wants!
