=== Description ===

Ubuntu Concept is, currently, a concept redesign of Ubuntu, that I made. I looked at Ubuntu and I felt it needed improvement. So, I set off to redesign... Everything. Rethink every aspect about it, while still remaining very much Ubuntu and Linux. Keeping in mind usability and 'openness' in regards of design.

I was told that it would be a good idea to submit this here, so, here it is.
