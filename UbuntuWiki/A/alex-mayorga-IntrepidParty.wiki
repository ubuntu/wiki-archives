__TOC__

It all will start at Harmon Hall's Conversation Club (that I moderate) at 1:30 p.m. where you'd be able to test drive the distro and talk about it, preferably in English ;)

From there we would move to El Paseo's Food Court so all attendees can grab something to eat and we'll burn CDs in the spot for passer-bys and interested people.

If the attendees feel like we might continue with some drinks at Chili's or Las Alitas.

As always everybody is welcome :)
