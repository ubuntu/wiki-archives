== Quantal Quetzal (12.10) Installation Instructions ==

=== OMAP4 ===

With the Ubuntu 12.10, ARM desktop images are now standard Ubuntu live images as known from other architectures. To install these images you should have a USB disk as target device.

* dd omap4 image on to sd-card
* plugin sd-card & usb-stick
* boot & install on to usb-stick

=== OMAP3 ===

* Follow more or less 12.04 instructions, but use the 12.10 pre-installed images.

== Precise Pangolin (12.04) Installation Instructions ==

To use preinstalled OMAP3/4 Precise (12.04) images, apply the following steps:

=== Downloading ===

Download the compressed image from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04/
* For omap3 platforms, use ubuntu-12.04-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+omap.img.gz
* For omap4 based systems, use ubuntu-12.04-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+omap4.img.gz

 /!\ Warning /!\ Check the md5sum to verify the image

=== Booting the image ===

On Pandaboard and BeagleXM just switch on the board with the SD card inserted.

==== On older Beagleboards ====
Insert SD card with new image into the beagleboard and reset while holding User1 button on system

/!\ On omap3 systems with a modified NAND (i.e. beaglebord C series) do the following:  

On a serial console connected to the system, halt any autoboot script and type 
<pre>
setenv bootcmd 'mmc rescan;fatload mmc 0 0x82000000 boot.scr;source 0x82000000'; setenv autostart yes; saveenv; boot
</pre>
The system should start booting (note that this step is only necessary if you have a NAND and the system does not default to reading boot.scr)
