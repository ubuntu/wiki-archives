__TOC__

   I have been a CAD technician and draftsperson since 1987 and have been involved with computers ever since. Have been interested in Open source and Linux since 2004. Currently running Ubuntu and Xubuntu at home and administering a Ubuntu server at work for a windows network. I am also slowly switching our office to Openoffice.
   I am particularly interested in open source graphics and CAD as well as engineering. I am also a member of the Open Design Alliance. Would love to see some good CAD support on Ubuntu
