==== Summary of the March 23, 2008 meeting ====

johnc4510 called the meeting to order at 9:02 PM

johnc4510 began the meeting by talking about the server that had been donated to the Team.  It's been running for about 3 days, now and it's fast and everything works.  johnc4510 has gone out and bought a server book.  He hopes to have learned enough by the time Hardy Final comes out to make it work.  He also suggested that, once we have the server fully set up, we thank the donor.  johnc4510 has his email address, and permission to give it out.  kennymc0 suggested that johnc4510 take pictures of the new server and put them up on the web where we could all see them, and johnc4510 thought that was a good idea.

soldats has been working on the flier for the InstallFest, and once it's ready we can start handing them out.  johnc4510 mentioned that he was still working on getting a site for the InstallFest in the Tucson area, but that Pima is dragging it's feet.  He felt that if he doesn't hear from them this week that he will have to look for another place to hold the Tucson InstallFest.  We do have a location for the Phoenix InstallFest:

West Building (basketball gym) <<BR>>
First Baptist Church of Peoria <<BR>>
8133 W Cactus Rd <<BR>>
Peoria, AZ 85381 <<BR>>

enigmastrat got us the location.  It's in a church gym, and there are plenty of plugs, wireless and wired internet, and there will be a LAN party going on at the same time. There will also be tables to put people's computers on.

Someone found a link to a computer store that is running an Ubuntu Hardy Heron Release Party (http://www.yelp.com/events/mesa-redseven---ubuntu-release-party-hardy-herron)  (See also http://www.redsevenlinux.com/events/).  The store is RedSeven, and they have apparently done this before in the Tempe area and this year decided to do it at the Mesa store because it had more room.  tyche will be going down to the store to talk to them about the Team and what it does, and promoting the Team as an additional resource for RedSeven's customers.  He will also be talking about the InstallFest and the opportunity it would provide RedSeven for further exposure, as well as attempting to  enlist their aid in putting the InstallFest on.  johnc4510 mentioned that tyche had promised to behave himself, but tyche doesn't remember making any such promise.

While the meeting was going on, soldats was adding a few finishing touches to the flier.  tyche was asked to explain how to get the flier and print it.  "The png file that soldats will put on the Forum is of a good enough size to print cleanly.  Just download it to your favorite download area and print from 'Image Viewer' or the equivalent.  Print to fit.  By the way, it prints clean, and fills an 8 1/2 X 11 inch page."  soldats was congratulated and thanked for the job he did putting the flier together.

johnc4510 then asked how many in the Phoenix area would be helping at the InstallFest.  enigmastrat, tyche, and kennymc0 responded.  We would like to see more people from the Phoenix and Tucson areas at the InstallFest.  [ed. note:  This is an opportunity to help advocate Ubuntu, and an opportunity to meet other Team members and get to know them.  Your experiences with Ubuntu are valuable:  how you use it, how you came to discover Linux, the problems you've had and how you overcame them all add up to a resource that new users need.  Plus, it's just plain fun to meet other Team members live, and find out more about them.  It makes your interaction in the IRC channel that much more enjoyable and relaxed. There's also the feeling of accomplishment you gain by helping others to master new skills and learn how to avoid the trapped feeling of proprietary software.  Please join us and let us get to know you better, and get to know us better.]

As a parting word, johnc4510 announced that slofgren's wife is due to have a baby this week.  slofgren will announce when the baby is born.  The Team expressed their best wishes to slofgren and his wife.

The meeting was adjourned at 9:51 PM.
