== Africa Colors ==

Since Ubuntu is freedom for human beings and is based on Africa, here is a draft for the wallpaper for the next generation , is based on the Bluprint (A changing Wallpaper over Time).

=== Concept ===
The main idea is to bring new colors to the desktop but keeping the orange and red alive.

--Number 1 and 8 are really nice ! Steph.
Based on the idea of a changing wallpaper over time from Hardy Heron Blueprints

* I really like this concept of changing wallpaper over time, but I don't think these as the images that should be used. The motive if good, but the resolution is too low and they look a bit compressed - perhaps the colors also should be adjusted slightly. -MadsRH 2008|02|22
