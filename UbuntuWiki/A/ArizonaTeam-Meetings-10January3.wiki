[Sunday 03 January 2010] [21:03:23] <scott_ev_>	I believe most of you know that I am only moderating meetings on a temporary basis:  I am not the team leader.  Our team leader, johnc4510, is taking some time off from moderating our meetings.  He is still around handling other aspects of running our LoCo and generally taking care of things that don't require a public presence.

[Sunday 03 January 2010] [21:04:20] <scott_ev_>	He is still around handling other aspects of running our LoCo and generally taking care of things that don't require a public presence.
[Sunday 03 January 2010] [21:04:31] <scott_ev_>	In time, this should change and we'll again be rewarded with the opportunity to interract with him.  Until then we'll just have to see what we can do to keep this team active and on track.

[Sunday 03 January 2010] [21:05:16] <scott_ev_>	Installfest goes from 10am - 4pm.  Boulders is a great place for us to meet since we can gave the upstairs room to ourselves and we can have access to the interweb tubes.  Hans, what do we need to bring with us to setup wifi?
