For discovering new software. 

Maybe there could be a box where you type in what you want to do, then results are returned for what you wanted to do.

For example.

Type in "Write a letter". Then Openoffice.org and abiword appear in a list.

Type in "Play games". Then games appear in a list.

Type in "Talk to friends" and programs like skype and pidgin appear in a list.
