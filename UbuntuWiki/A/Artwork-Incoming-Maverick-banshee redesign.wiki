=== Comments ===
* I love your mockup, it really saves space! Unfortunately, Banshee design doesn't depend on Canonical. If I would be you, I'd file a bug against Banshee itself in their own bug tracker (http://banshee.fm/contribute/file-bugs/), then posted it to their mailing list (see http://banshee.fm/about/contact/). Since Banshee is being integrated into MeeGo, where saving screen space is really important. It's a good idea to remind about it ;) --Sergey "Shnatsel" Davidoff
