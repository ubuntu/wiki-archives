== Agenda ==

* Changing to fortnightly meetings
** Going to fortnightly meetings may increase the attendance at the meetings because they are less frequent - NaamanCampbell

* Adding a "Talks" section on the Wiki page
** List talks given in Australia by members of the LoCo team - NaamanCampbell

* Official LoCo Team Confirmation
** Apply for consideration for being added to the official listing of LoCo teams at the next CC meeting (see LoCoTeamList for more info) - NaamanCampbell
** I've talked to Matthias Ulrichs about it, and we're now on the agenda for the next CC meeting. YukiCuss and I should be in attendance. - WilliamGrant

* Projects
** Schools Project
** Discussion of schools project - NaamanCampbell

** Business Project

** Discussion of marketing strategies within Australia for Ubuntu - NaamanCampbell

* Install CD distribution
** Ordering and delivering install CD's locally - <nowiki>[[Jellyware]]</nowiki>
** One or two people in each state with a large number of CDs for distribution? - WilliamGrant
** Effective way of adding CD's to local libraries for people to borrow                       (re: http://www.newsforge.com/software/03/12/14/1545216.shtml)? - AndrewSwinn

* Website/Forum
** Is there a need for the AustralianTeam to have a website? Communications can be provided by the Wiki & Launchpad pages along with a permanent home on the Ubuntu Forums. - NaamanCampbell

* Logo
** DavidSymons created the idea for the AustralianTeam logo (Ubuntu logo with black Southern Cross superimposed), however his version was based on raster stars, and as such did not scale well. I created a new SVG version, although Gamma crucis (the left-hand point) needs repositioning. Any ideas? - WilliamGrant
** How about a green kangaroo in the middle of the Ubuntu circle?  The kangaroo would be exactly the same as the "Australian Made" kangaroo. - NaamanCampbell
