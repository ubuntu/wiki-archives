__TOC__

I'm a technical trainer and live in Panama (central america), I specialize in hardware and backup solutions. I started using Linux casually in 1999, I got serious about the operating system back in 2004 and migrated fully to it as a desktop OS in 2005 with Ubuntu.

I like to contribute to Open Source projects, and since I've adopted Ubuntu, I do what I can in order to support the community. What I do is hardware testing to ensure compatibility of the OS, I've also gone around Rosetta making suggestions for the spanish release of Ubuntu, promote the use of it and help with the use of the OS.

This is me:

What I'm doing for Ubuntu:

* Hardware testing
* Minor spanish translations
* Helping out in the forums
* Compiling list of web resources for new users
