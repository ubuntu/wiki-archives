=== i386 ===
Sound does not work out of the box. After upgrading it works sometimes(restarting may fix it). Sound crashes when the volue is adjusted. The gigabyte ethernet cannot be set up during installation, but works fine with gnome's networking tool (network-admin). Otherwise it is functional.

=== AMD64 ===
Installation cannot autoconfigure the ethernet properly, network-admin autoconfigs painlessly. Integrated sound works flawlessly.
