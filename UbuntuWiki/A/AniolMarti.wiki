== Brief Description ==

I am a 18 years old electrical engineering and computer science student. I've been using Linux "distros" since 2011, either desktop or server versions. My first one was Ubuntu 10.04. Since then, I've been working with guifi.net as a volunteer, as a sysadmin (Linux and Mikrotik), etc. I also attended to a C++ 5-days course in UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya) and in a lot of online courses about coding, network administration, etc. Recently, I got the MTCNA certificate.
