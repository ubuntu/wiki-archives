== SGX Video Acceleration ==

=== Installing drivers for OMAP 3 ===

 '''TI does not offer a hardfloat build of the omap3 SGX drivers, thus this package is not available for the 12.04 armhf images'''

Activate the universe and multiverse repositories, then install the following packages:
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install libegl1-sgx-omap3 libgles1-sgx-omap3 libgles2-sgx-omap3
</pre>

Before using it just be sure your user is also included at 'video' group.

=== Installing drivers for OMAP 4 ===

 ''' NOTE !!! The procedure below is only necessary on installs prior 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), from 12.04 on the SGX driver is included in the ubuntu archive and will be offered to you automatically by the hardware driver manager (jockey) after installation'''
 
<nowiki>[[File:ti-ppa.png|TI Ubuntu extras Installation Icon|align="top"]]</nowiki>

If you're using the official pre-installed image you will find an icon with a TI logo in the unity launcher on the left (see image above). Just clicking on the icon will automatically install the TI OMAP4 Extras and you'll have SGX working after your next reboot. If you are adventurous you can also add the TI OMAP trunk ppa that contains unreleased packages using:

<pre>
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:tiomap-dev/omap-trunk
</pre>

In case you want to install it by hand, just activate the tiomap-dev PPA https://launchpad.net/~tiomap-dev/+archive/release and make sure you install the following packages:
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install libegl1-sgx-omap4 libgles1-sgx-omap4 libgles2-sgx-omap4
</pre>

There is also a metapackage just for the SGX support that installs the above packages and more
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-omap4-extras-graphics
</pre>

=== Testing SGX with a DEMO ===

Grab the SDK Demo Package from http://neuvoo.org/neuvoo/distfiles/SGX-3.01.00.07-SDK.tar.gz

Then to run the demos just get into the X11 Binaries directory (e.g.
OGLES/SDKPackage/Binaries/CommonX11/Demos/EvilSkull) and run the demo:
<pre>
$ ./OGLESEvilSkull
</pre>

You can also install the package '''mesa-utils-extra''' that contains '''es2gears''' and '''es2_info''' (available only at >= Natty)
