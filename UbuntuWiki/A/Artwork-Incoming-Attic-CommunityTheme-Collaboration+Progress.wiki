__TOC__

At the core--these two put together usually become: __"Reaching New Heights"__

*** This is probably far too close to FC7's "Flying High"
*** I suppose this means we both have high aspirations?

== Basic ==

=== Progress ===

*** Sense of motion
*** __Forward colours__
**** This very much implies warm colours--warm colors come forward, cool recede
**** Use Nature like colours (idea: colour groups representing a piece of reality)
*** Directional lines
*** All pieces should have a ''very distinct sense of directionality''
**** Perspective is a good tool to achieve this, and much better than the 'Wind' effect

=== Collaboration ===
*** Things enjoined, intertwined
*** Interlocking pieces
*** Circular motifs
*** Rather than things building up to make a whole--that would imply building/creation rather than collaboration
*** __Harmonizing colours__
*** We need to answer the question: Where do WE collaborate? Then we need to ask ourselves some other questions: What is the atmosphere of that place? What moods it implies? Are we happy or sad when collaborating? -- when done we have to translate the answers to colors.

== Motifs ==

*** The circular motifs of collaboration contradict the directionality of progress^1^
**** ^1^Semi-offtopic sidenote: An image of DNA springs to mind, intertwining and yet reaching relatively infinite distances

=== Progress ===

*** Arrows, timelines
*** Artifical objects--avoid overdoing chrome (Very NA connotation)
*** ''An evolution of objects, shapes''

=== Collaboration ===

*** Pieces-swatches of color pieced together, different yet complementing.
*** ''A patchy colour look can contribute to the organic feel commonly associated with Ubuntu''
*** Puzzles
*** Gears in sync
*** Synergy

Building, directional energy?

Do not use the glass effect where it's not present! Example is glass like paper. It's just not natural.
