== Human-Colorable ==

This is a proof of concept for a color choosing Human theme.  I updated the Human theme using the documentation at http://live.gnome.org/GnomeArt/Tutorials/GtkThemes/SymbolicColors.  I did this to make sure it was possible to enable color choosing with whatever gtk theme we choose for Hardy, such as Human-Murrine.

== Installation ==
You can install it by dragging the Human-Color.tar.gz (download attachment below) into System->Preferences->Appearance window.  This will install the theme to ~/.themes/.  Any windows requiring sudo privileges will not render properly using this method, however.  To get those windows to work, you have to untar Human-Color.tar.gz to /usr/share/themes/ by running "sudo tar -xzvf Human-Color.tar.gz -C /usr/share/themes/".
