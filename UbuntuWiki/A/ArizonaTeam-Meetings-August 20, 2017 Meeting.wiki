 04:09 <MajB> TEAM NEWS:

 04:09 <MajB> Team Projects Page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/TeamProjects

 04:09 <MajB> If anyone would like to take on a project listed, just notify any administrator and you will be added to the page as the project manager.

 04:10 <MajB> We are still getting lots of hits on azloco.org since we started posting articles and would like to continue to add articles.  See any team administrator to get access to post to the blogs if you do not already have access or to recommend that any posting be moved to the front page.

 04:10 <MajB> It is time for the Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team to be re-validated.  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Re-validationApplication2017 for the Re-validation application.  If you have any input, please send it to Rex Bouwense, majb@azloco.com.

 04:10 <MajB> We are on the LoCo Councilâ€™s agenda for re-verification at their 12 September meeting.  It will be on the #Ubuntu-meeting channel on irc.freenode.net.  The start time is 2000 UTC (1300 our time).  Attend if you can to support your local Team.

 04:11 <MajB> We are unable to hold the Installfest at UAT on 16 September and 04 November because of schedule conflicts at the University.  We do need a volunteer to find alternate locations and coordinate our use of it/them.  Without a volunteer to do this we may be forced to cancel the Installfest for both days.  Please contact any Team Admin to volunteer for this task.  Time is of the essence here.
