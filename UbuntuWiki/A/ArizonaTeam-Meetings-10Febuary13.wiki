Feb 13 21:08:31 toddc we even put Mr. Wong from MS to work which lead to interesting conversations
Feb 13 21:08:49 toddc The last several installfests have been very busy so if you have time or want to meet any of us or have problems feel free to show up.
Feb 13 21:09:17 toddc Installfests are last Saturday of the month at UAT 48st and baseline in Tempe right off the I10 and across from Fry's electronics from 10am to 4pm
Feb 13 21:09:19 LostPenguin so no one hre from tucson that goes to those?
Feb 13 21:10:39 toddc john used to come up and we used to do one at UOA but we need a local person to make arrangements--local contact interested?
Feb 13 21:10:59 xHans toddc: thanks for getting the PLUG events as well!
Feb 13 21:11:12 LostPenguin only place I can probably set up is the Arivaca library
Feb 13 21:11:30 toddc we have several people that would drive down to help with a event
Feb 13 21:11:35 LostPenguin I do not live in tucson, but it is the clocest city to me
Feb 13 21:12:27 toddc UofA has hosted us before and I can get contacts there and a lot of students came to the last event
Feb 13 21:12:56 toddc they use ubuntu on all of there servers and recommend ubuntu desktops
Feb 13 21:13:13 kennymc0 cool
Feb 13 21:13:30 LostPenguin if you could get some of their contact info, please let me know so I can try and bum a ride
Feb 13 21:14:07 toddc I only recommend them since I know them and it would draw a large crowd
Feb 13 21:14:56 toddc give me a couple of days and I will get you the contacts name and numbers
Feb 13 21:15:22 LostPenguin thanks, it's the only way I'll ever get to go
Feb 13 21:15:26 toddc then we can set up a date and time
Feb 13 21:15:47 toddc last one drew around 30
Feb 13 21:16:16 toddc xHans if you are here do you have any news for us?
Feb 13 21:18:17 xHans toddc: you already did a great job covering them
Feb 13 21:18:35 xHans hmm, guess I could add some URLs
Feb 13 21:18:40 xHans http://www.LuftHans.com/Free_Software_Stammtisch#East_Valley
Feb 13 21:18:44 xHans http://PLUG.phoenix.az.us/hackfest
Feb 13 21:18:44 toddc I was not sure if you could make it tonight
Feb 13 21:18:48 xHans http://PLUG.phoenix.az.us/node/218
Feb 13 21:18:56 xHans I should not have :)
Feb 13 21:21:36 toddc Thanks xHans
Feb 13 21:21:52 toddc if there is nothing else?
Feb 13 21:22:04 toddc Thank you for coming here this evening and have a great week!
Feb 13 21:22:18 LostPenguin thanks, I'll be around
Feb 13 21:22:20 kennymc0 you to
Feb 13 21:22:49 toddc I will also talk to plug and see if they can help with a Tucson installfest
Feb 13 21:23:30 LostPenguin I can hich hike to tucson, but I don't know anyone there naymore
Feb 13 21:24:32 toddc we just need wifi or network access to hold a installfest I have a small server with distros to burn as we may need them
Feb 13 21:24:35 xHans maybe an Arizona BoF at SCaLE again this year to find Tucsonians
Feb 13 21:26:10 toddc and will dig out my contact notes for UofA and maybe we can contact john4510 he may be able to help there also
Feb 13 21:26:30 LostPenguin Pima college, U of A and Tucson/Pima library will all probably be ok
Feb 13 21:28:14 toddc when I did tempe city we made flyers and spent a afternoon posting them around at library's
Feb 13 21:29:13 LostPenguin I can probably hitch hike up there, spend the day doing flyers, night in a wash, and hitchhike back
Feb 13 21:29:35 LostPenguin but I would need money for flyers and bus fare
Feb 13 21:31:27 toddc most library's and collages are happy to make room for this type of event --I should be able to make them I have a few templates and could mail them and maybe find someone to distribute them I know a few students there
Feb 13 21:31:45 toddc make the flyers
Feb 13 21:32:54 LostPenguin that would be better, I hate speeleing outside lol
Feb 13 21:33:06 LostPenguin sleeping*
Feb 13 21:34:16 toddc np if you make the calls I can do some  of the legwork
Feb 13 21:35:58 LostPenguin calls to who?  wherever we're gonna set up?
Feb 13 21:38:45 toddc yes I had some ITdept contacts at uoa that will find us a room and internet and put it in uni newsletter ifI can find it it will make setting up a event easy
Feb 13 21:40:00 toddc they alreay use ubuntu and want the students to use it and were really helpful and thanked us last time
Feb 13 21:40:30 LostPenguin And that was through IT or some club they had on campus?
Feb 13 21:41:39 toddc IT dept set it up then posted it in the newsletter and told the IT classes about the event
Feb 13 21:42:27 LostPenguin That should be a lot easier to track down over web/phone than a club
Feb 13 21:42:53 toddc we had students that already knew how to install helping those that wanted to learn and we just guided the whole thing
Feb 13 21:43:25 LostPenguin IDC what I have to do as long as I can get my DVB-s card running --;
Feb 13 21:44:12 LostPenguin I'm gonna look pretty silly walking around with a dish lol
Feb 13 21:44:49 toddc have you made a post in the ubuntu forum about that?
Feb 13 21:45:16 LostPenguin I have neer found forums helpful
Feb 13 21:45:20 LostPenguin never*
Feb 13 21:45:37 LostPenguin forums or ee-mail lists
Feb 13 21:46:23 * kennymc0 has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
Feb 13 21:46:50 LostPenguin IRC and google are the only thngs that have ever helped me
Feb 13 21:47:30 toddc that would be the most likely place I can think of to find someone that knows that info but it would take some time to get a reply
Feb 13 21:49:11 LostPenguin seriosly, every forum I have ver posted on for anything has never helped me, I don't even bother any more.
Feb 13 21:49:19 soldats LostPenguin: are you trying to run mythtv or something
Feb 13 21:49:34 toddc that is a area that most techs do not deal with all the IT server guys I know work mostly in data centers with fiber but there must be someone that that uses SAT for remote connections
Feb 13 21:50:05 LostPenguin I'm trying to get my card to be recognised by linux, but the drivers I got from my hw provider are chinese crap that installed to the wrong place
Feb 13 21:50:40 soldats ahh
Feb 13 21:50:55 soldats ive never used one
Feb 13 21:51:02 soldats cant be much help sorry
Feb 13 21:51:04 LostPenguin meanwhile, their support department is taking the month off for the lunar new year
Feb 13 21:51:11 soldats haha
Feb 13 21:51:44 xHans don't know what DVB-s is, but look at kernel documentation for driver info
Feb 13 21:52:03 xHans it's a bit of a pain, but if the kernel has support for the device it should be in the kernel docs
Feb 13 21:52:23 LostPenguin http://www.mygica.com/down-eng/linuxforsatboxmini.zip
Feb 13 21:52:26 soldats mythtv apparently supports it
Feb 13 21:52:57 LostPenguin DVB-S is a fancy way of saying Sat TV
Feb 13 21:53:13 xHans as to installing on the wrong place, try soft links
Feb 13 21:53:27 xHans ah, don't watch TV, so I still don't know :)
Feb 13 21:53:45 xHans but, a grep through the kernel docs might pull up something useful for you
Feb 13 21:53:47 LostPenguin the problem is that if I use the stuff they have, I would lose all my USB support
Feb 13 21:54:25 LostPenguin I've been trying for weeks, nothing make any scence
Feb 13 21:54:36 LostPenguin I had it up and running in 2 seconds on windows --;
Feb 13 21:55:23 LostPenguin I tried kernel.org
Feb 13 21:55:31 LostPenguin and other variants
Feb 13 21:56:13 xHans LostPenguin: there is a kernel doc package
Feb 13 21:57:24 LostPenguin I have read lots of kernel docs, can you be more specific?
Feb 13 21:57:39 xHans nope, not really
Feb 13 21:57:57 soldats what type of card is it
Feb 13 21:58:03 xHans the kernel docs package puts a bunch of kernel documentation in one directory and below
Feb 13 21:58:13 xHans a recursive grep in that directory might pull up something
Feb 13 21:58:27 LostPenguin mygica satbox mini
Feb 13 21:58:36 xHans e.g. grep -ri dvb-s /usr/share/doc/kernel-doc/
Feb 13 21:59:12 LostPenguin I tried to read that, went over my head
Feb 13 21:59:38 * slfdstrct_ (~chatzilla@ip72-201-240-84.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined #Ubuntu-US-AZ
Feb 13 22:00:18 xHans LostPenguin: if you can find relevant documentation we might be able to provide a translation
Feb 13 22:00:35 LostPenguin http://www.mygica.com/down-eng/linuxforsatboxmini.zip
Feb 13 22:00:40 LostPenguin that's the bad drivers
Feb 13 22:01:50 LostPenguin I can plug it in and tell you the hwid once I'm done in FFXI
Feb 13 22:06:58 LostPenguin 1f4d:2000
Feb 13 22:08:17 LostPenguin the driver it might be using is dvb-usb-cxusb
Feb 13 22:10:45 xHans looks like the Germans have been having problems with that device since at least 2007
Feb 13 22:11:13 soldats yup
Feb 13 22:11:22 soldats just saw a post about htat
Feb 13 22:11:28 soldats that
Feb 13 22:11:45 soldats http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/dvb-s-satbox-mini-auf-ubuntu/#post-2774126
Feb 13 22:11:50 soldats translate that
Feb 13 22:11:52 xHans http://www.vdrportal.de/board/thread.php?postid=922113
Feb 13 22:12:27 xHans the second poster there, Markus, says he got his working with the driver from Igor Liplianin, but the USB-ID had to be added
Feb 13 22:12:41 xHans the big box shows the change to add the USB-ID
Feb 13 22:12:59 soldats different cards though
Feb 13 22:13:18 LostPenguin that's 3000, not 2000, and it's S2 not S
Feb 13 22:13:22 soldats LostPenguin: how did you instll the drivers
Feb 13 22:13:31 LostPenguin sudo make install
Feb 13 22:13:45 LostPenguin puts it all in an old ass kernal directory
Feb 13 22:13:52 xHans ah, I was searching for the id, but didn't notice there was a change
Feb 13 22:14:01 xHans maybe Igor has a driver for your card as well
Feb 13 22:14:18 soldats LostPenguin: what does the makefile say
Feb 13 22:15:55 soldats LostPenguin: try running "make" instead of "make install"
Feb 13 22:16:09 soldats i havent read the README or Makefile
Feb 13 22:16:21 soldats should give some good clue
Feb 13 22:16:56 soldats also take a look at the link i posted, you need to google translate it or however you want to translate it
Feb 13 22:17:07 soldats it says unsolved but its recent
Feb 13 22:17:11 LostPenguin sudo make clean and sudo make do not work
Feb 13 22:17:32 LostPenguin I did look at it, it is not for my device
Feb 13 22:18:46 * SlickMcRunFast (~mark@host-86-116.aztegmo.clients.pavlovmedia.com) has joined #Ubuntu-US-AZ
Feb 13 22:24:22 LostPenguin but I can tell from that post I need tood code to compile and I 'm not going to get the device IDs I need associated without recompiling the kernel
Feb 13 22:24:48 LostPenguin so I'm fucked
Feb 13 22:28:47 soldats recompile the kernel then
Feb 13 22:28:54 soldats its pretty easy
Feb 13 22:29:02 LostPenguin I don;t have the soruce  need for my device
Feb 13 22:29:20 soldats ahh
Feb 13 22:29:31 soldats hope you get it figgured out son
Feb 13 22:29:56 LostPenguin no, it's not going to happen.  It's going to be the reason I give up on linux
Feb 13 22:30:14 soldats weak
Feb 13 22:30:23 soldats dual boot with windows
Feb 13 22:30:29 soldats and use it in windows
Feb 13 22:31:02 LostPenguin RQCS won't use anything but serial ports under windows
Feb 13 22:31:20 * sloggerkhan (~slogger@ip68-104-215-102.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined #Ubuntu-US-AZ
Feb 13 22:31:43 soldats IMO it doesnt justify giving up on linux as a whole
Feb 13 22:31:54 sloggerkhan hi
Feb 13 22:31:56 soldats just me though
Feb 13 22:32:02 soldats hey
Feb 13 22:32:19 LostPenguin it's the same problem I was having 10 yeas ago, if your device isn;t already in the kernel, it can't be se
Feb 13 22:32:22 LostPenguin used*
Feb 13 22:32:58 soldats wait it out, you cant always rush the devs
Feb 13 22:33:26 sloggerkhan what's not working?
Feb 13 22:33:29 soldats it will eventually be if enough people are requesting it
Feb 13 22:33:48 soldats sat tv
Feb 13 22:33:51 xHans LostPenguin: so only buy devices that have support
Feb 13 22:34:01 soldats ^^^
Feb 13 22:34:07 soldats google first
Feb 13 22:34:08 LostPenguin people are requesting it, but the advice they're getting is "get a new device supported by linux"
Feb 13 22:34:34 soldats words of the wise
Feb 13 22:34:43 soldats unless youre a dev
Feb 13 22:34:48 sloggerkhan Sat TV? As in what, a satellite dish controller?
Feb 13 22:34:53 LostPenguin this is something I've been working on for weeks, I've gooled to the point where I don;t know what to google any more
Feb 13 22:35:02 LostPenguin yeah, DVB-S
Feb 13 22:35:29 sloggerkhan Did you know you can buy a satellite for under $15,000 and launch it for under $100 grand?
Feb 13 22:35:49 soldats i wish i had the money
Feb 13 22:35:50 sloggerkhan Instead of a luxury car you could get your own satellite!
Feb 13 22:35:57 sloggerkhan Yeah.
Feb 13 22:36:10 LostPenguin I don't even have a car let alone luxory --;
Feb 13 22:36:19 sloggerkhan I don't know anything about DVB-S, though. I'd never hear of it until just now.
Feb 13 22:36:27 soldats i only have a bicycle
Feb 13 22:36:46 LostPenguin <-- Golf Cart
Feb 13 22:36:55 SlickMcRunFast how was the meeting tonight?
Feb 13 22:36:56 soldats ha
Feb 13 22:37:10 soldats 30 min
Feb 13 22:37:12 LostPenguin un-eventful
Feb 13 22:52:44 xHans http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-S_USB_Devices
Feb 13 22:53:48 xHans LostPenguin: is this what you have? http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/TerraTec_Cinergy_S_USB
Feb 13 22:54:08 xHans ah, no, different USB ID
Feb 13 22:54:46 LostPenguin yeah, different ID
Feb 13 22:55:28 xHans looks like there are a few devices that are supported with a couple already in the kernel
Feb 13 22:56:33 LostPenguin yeah, the bad compile makes a dvb-usb-cxusb that might be compatible with the one in the kernel
Feb 13 22:56:48 xHans one is even advertising GNU/Linux support
Feb 13 22:56:52 xHans http://www.worlddvb.com.cn/product/htm/usbs.htm
Feb 13 22:58:51 LostPenguin http://www.mygica.com/pa/satboxmini.asp

Feb 13 23:00:43 xHans well, if the Linux group says there's support, that should be trustable
Feb 13 23:00:49 LostPenguin thta is what I have
Feb 13 23:00:54 xHans http://www.aliexpress.com/product-fm/385103260-DVBWorld-DVB-S-2102-USB2-0-Free-Shipping-wholesalers.html
Feb 13 23:00:59 xHans bah, bad paste :)
Feb 13 23:01:06 LostPenguin I can not afford to buy another tuner
Feb 13 23:01:54 xHans can you return the one you have in order to buy one that works?
Feb 13 23:02:00 LostPenguin no
