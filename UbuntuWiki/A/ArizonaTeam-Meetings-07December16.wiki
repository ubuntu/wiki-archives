[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:01:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	no new members      so announcement
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:01:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	We have a new team channel if you hadn't noticed. It's #ubuntu-us-az. If you have auto-joined enabled on your chat client, it will bring you here automatically since there is a redirect on the old channel.
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:02:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	This change is due to compliance with the Community Council to make channelo names consistant. I have gone through and changed all the links I could find on our server, wiki pages, and forum threads
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:02:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	If you come across one that I have missed, go ahead and change it, or let myself or tyche know so we can.
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:03:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	next
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:03:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	With the Holiday Season getting into full swing now, we will still have meetings
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:03:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	They may be a little bit more informal, but we feel it a good idea to show consistance by continuing at our regular schedule
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:03:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	I hope you all enjoy the peace of the season, and the blessing of family during this time. Happy Holidays!!
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:04:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk, that does it for the announcements

[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:04:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	We continue to add applications to the Education Team page, although at a slow pace. SloggerKhan sent in items to add to the Graphics list under the Optional category.
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:05:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	Here is the link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Education/Graphics  you might want to take a look at it at your leisure to see what optional apps you can add to the graphics menu to round out this section of your install.
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:05:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	We still need members to help us add items to the following pages: System Tools, Sound & Video, Programming, and Other.
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:05:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	If you can find time to give us a few minutes it would be appreciated. You can look at any of the other pages to see what we're doing and then just email myself at johnc4510-cox@ubuntu.com or tyche. Tyche could you give your email address please? Thanks
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:06:03] <tyche>	My email address is tyche@cox.net

[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:07:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	enigmastrat: where are you at with the main page?
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:07:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	http://ubuntuaz.selfip.com/
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:07:55] <enigmastrat>	well, design wise, to tell you the truth, I have tried some different stuff with taht side, but I like what I've got the best so far
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:08:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:08:09] <enigmastrat>	PHP wise, it'll be quick once we're ready for it
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:08:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:08:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	have you spoken with slofgren  about that?
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:08:35] <enigmastrat>	I have not
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:08:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:08:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'll try to speak with him this wk then
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:08:56] <enigmastrat>	but with the map of the site, we may just need one or two pages in which case straight HTML would be fine
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:09:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: you might help me remember that
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:09:21] <johnc4510-laptop>	k
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:09:31] <tyche>	I'll try.  But I have the mind of an amnesiac elephant. . .I always forget.
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:09:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	if we start a second page, what do you all suggest we populate it with
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:09:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:10:27] <tyche>	How about team purpose?
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:10:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	like goals you mean?
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:10:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	or why we're doing what we're doing
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:11:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:11:16] <tyche>	Yea, and even more general - why we're doing what we're doing, and how we're doing it.
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:11:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:11:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	good idea
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:12:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	another thought for a page would be to use it to imphasize the lugs of the state
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:12:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	emphasize
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:12:19] <tyche>	Oh, definitely.  With links and logos, if any.
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:12:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	sure
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:12:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	k, so that's ideas for a couple of pages then
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:13:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	enigmastrat: how hard to make a second html page
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:13:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	it could be a twin of the first as far as layout is concerned
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:13:44] <tyche>	johnc4510-laptop: How about keep the same basic features, just change the text.
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:13:47] <enigmastrat>	not at all
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:13:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	not content

[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:14:39] <enigmastrat>	just make a copy of the first with a different name, change the text
[Sun Dec 16 2007] [21:14:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk  :)
