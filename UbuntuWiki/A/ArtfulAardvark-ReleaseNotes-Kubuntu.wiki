== Other highlights/notes ==

* VLC now replaces Dragonplayer as our default media player.
* Muon package manager is now shipped by default once again, as an alternative to Plasma Discover.
* KTorrent has been updated to version 5.1, built against the new Qt 5.9.1 release.
* <nowiki>[[https://github.com/CDrummond/cantata |Cantata]]</nowiki> Qt5 music player replaces the unmaintained KDE4 based Amarok as our default for this release. Please test this change. This is a <nowiki>[[https://www.musicpd.org/ | Music Player Daemon]]</nowiki> frontend, so configuration & usage may be unfamiliar. Most users will want to select the 'basic single user setup' in the first run wizard.
* Telepathy instant messaging client has been dropped from our defaults as it is no longer maintained upstream, and  it has numerous issues. This is still available in the archive to install.
* Many other updated applications, such as new versions of Krita, Digikam, Kdevelop.....

== Known Problems ==

=== Incompatibility with BIOS in certain Lenovo, Acer systems ===
A bug in the original Linux 4.13 kernel shipped in Kubuntu (and Ubuntu and other flavours) 17.10 can leave users unable to update any of their BIOS settings, including their system’s boot order, after booting this version of Ubuntu.

Re-issued Kubuntu 17.10.1 installer images now contain a kernel update resolving this bug, and should be now be used.

Updated ISOs can be found at: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/17.10.1/release/

A full list of known affected models can be found in Bug:1734147.

If you have already installed Kubuntu 17.10 on an affected system before the release of the ISOs or updated kernel, you may not immediately notice this problem because Kubuntu will continue to boot from disk.  To verify whether your system has been affected by this bug, create a USB stick with the Kubuntu 16.04 desktop image and try to boot it.  If you are able to boot it, your system has most likely not been impacted by this bug.

=== pulseaudio - devices not showing/pulseaudio crash ===

* (Bug:1720519) KDE/Kubuntu: pulseaudio module "module-switch-on-connect" should be loaded once at most. Refusing to load
* (Bug:1716092) Enabling Auto switching streams on new active output causes pulseaudio to crash
__Possible workaround__

editing /etc/pulse/default.pa and commenting the last 3 lines:
<pre>
# .ifexists module-switch-on-connect.so
# load-module module-switch-on-connect
# .endif
</pre>
seems to solve the issue in some cases.
