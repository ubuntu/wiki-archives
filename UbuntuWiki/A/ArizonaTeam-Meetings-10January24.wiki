[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:00:36] <scott_ev_>	meeting time
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:01:00] <scott_ev_>	Good evening everyone, thanks for being here and welcome to the weekly meeting of the Arizona Ubuntu LoCo Team. Please let us know you're here with a +1.  Is there anyone here for the first time that hasn't had a chance to introduce themselves?
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:01:14] <tyche>	+1
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:01:18] <Flakeparadigm>	+1
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:01:42] <hutchnate>	+1
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:01:46] <jsonder>	+1
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:02:04] <scott_ev_>	jsonder is still our Education Team Leader as no one has taken over for him.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:02:04] <Siph0n>	+1
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:02:17] <jsonder>	Huh?
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:02:23] <scott_ev_>	yessir
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:02:26] <scott_ev_>	hhaa
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:02:35] <scott_ev_>	j/k
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:02:43] <xHans>	moin moin jsonder
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:02:59] <scott_ev_>	jsonder: since we haven't seen you in a while, tell us a little about you
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:03:26] <jsonder>	I'm a retired dude in Green Valley riding dirt bikes.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:03:28] <scott_ev_>	some of us don't know you
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:03:42] <scott_ev_>	nice, welcome back
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:03:51] <scott_ev_>	I believe most of you know that I am only moderating meetings on a temporary basis:  I am not the team leader.  Our team leader, johnc4510, is taking some time off from moderating our meetings. Until then we'll just have to see what we can do to keep this team active and on track.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:03:54] <jsonder>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/jsonder#preview
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:04:13] <scott_ev_>	Feel free, at any time during the meeting, to ask questions, make productive comments or observations: we want your input.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:04:30] <scott_ev_>	Ever wonder why we have LoCo teams? My opinion is that one of our main functions is to promote the use of an OS that allows people to be freed from confines of the closed, unstable, inflexible, expensive, Operating Systems that they may think they are stuck with - and we want to have fun doing it. So we get together on IRC and set up Installfests, Release Parties, etc.  Here's part of what Ubuntu has to say:
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:04:44] <scott_ev_>	Ever since the birth of computers, enthusiasts and fans around the world have collected together in garages, universities and pubs to talk about their interest, learn from each other and help promote their interest. Combine this with the huge popularity of Ubuntu, and you have the Ubuntu LoCo project.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:04:53] <scott_ev_>	is any of this getting cut off?
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:05:01] <tyche>	Not yet

[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:05:41] <scott_ev_>	With the incredible success of Ubuntu around the world, the LoCo project is here to help groups of Ubuntu fans and enthusiasts work together in regional teams to help advocate, promote, translate, develop and otherwise improve Ubuntu. Our worldwide network of LoCo teams is providing a strong backbone to our already vast and extensive Ubuntu community.

[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:09:45] <toddc>	same here
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:09:52] <scott_ev_>	Ubuntu Bug Day:

[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:10:06] <scott_ev_>	Ubuntu Brainstorm Top 5 this week
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:10:19] <scott_ev_>	 Touchpad Speed, seperate from Anything else speed - http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/23363/ It's not easy enough to install a desktop cube in Ubuntu - http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/23424/ display the size of files in software center - http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/23428/ Consider Brainstorm contributions in Launchpad Karma - http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/23365/
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:10:24] <scott_ev_>	 BetterPrint-preview - htt p://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/23415/
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:10:33] <scott_ev_>	Ubuntu Brainstorm is a community site geared toward letting you add your ideas for Ubuntu. You can submit your own idea, or vote for or against another idea. http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:10:50] <scott_ev_>	There will be a 10.04 Lucid Lynx release party at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe (http://www.bouldersonbroadway.net/) on the 24th of April. Boulders on Broadway has a room upstairs that we will have all to ourselves.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:11:00] <Flakeparadigm>	scott_ev_: No updates.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:11:04] <scott_ev_>	We'll have wifi access too.  It's going to be a good chance to eat some good grub, have a few drinks or brewski's and meet some of the other UbuGeeks that you have only met online.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:11:20] <scott_ev_>	Flakeparadigm: ok, I'll see what happens to me
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:11:36] <scott_ev_>	You're not going to want to miss this.  Ok, that brings up another point:  We need volunteers for a couple of things:  we'll need a few extension cords and power strips.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:11:47] <scott_ev_>	Who's planning on attending that can help out with that?
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:12:32] <scott_ev_>	it's a long way off, but I already have bitflip doing a presentation and flake is going to do a video presentatiopn that we'll have top run for him
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:12:41] <scott_ev_>	he won't be able to come to the party
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:13:01] <scott_ev_>	Someone can pick out new features in 10.04 and present them or concentrate on one for example.  Anything to do with Ubuntu will be OK.  Things like how to navigate Launchpad and report bugs...
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:13:16] <scott_ev_>	Actually, if you have a favorite piece of software that you use you can present that even if it's not in Ubuntu's repos.  Please be thinking about this.  It will only make the Release Party more of a success.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:13:26] <scott_ev_>	Here is a link to the Lucid Lynx planning page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/LucidLynx  Feel free to add to the ideas section or fill in anything that might be missing.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:13:37] <scott_ev_>	We will be heading there from the monthly installfest at UAT. http://tinyurl.com/yemru26 If you've never been to an installfest at UAT, you may want to consider checking it out.  Our LoCo co-sponsors it with PLUG but we are poorly represented.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:13:49] <scott_ev_>	and I'm guilty of not going too often also
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:14:00] <scott_ev_>	There's a proposed flyer posted at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1388113 please give us your feedback in the form of a vote with coments if needed.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:14:15] <scott_ev_>	http://azloco.com/node/120
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:14:24] <scott_ev_>	tyche, would you please send a link to the flyer to the PLUG mailing list so they know about it and the installfest?
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:14:54] <scott_ev_>	he may not be here.  he told me he sent a PM, but I didn't get it
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:14:59] <tyche>	I don't have the plug mailing list.  But xHans should be able to get it from here.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:00] Join	MrsApple has joined this channel (n=apple@64-130-243-10.sparkplugbb.net).
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:05] <scott_ev_>	OK, on to kk
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:14] <MrsApple>	KWACHA IM BACK!!!
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:14] <Flakeparadigm>	welcome MrsApple
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:15] <tyche>	WB, MrsApple
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:22] <scott_ev_>	 finally made contact with a friend in Tucson that has the contacts we need for planning future Installfests at the University.  He will be getting me in contact with the people on campus in the CS department that we coordinated with last time.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:31] <scott_ev_>	MrsApple: long time mommy
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:37] <MrsApple>	thanks tyler for helpin me ou. :)
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:41] <Flakeparadigm>	scott_ev_: I personally really like that flyer ;)
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:43] <MrsApple>	hey scott_ev
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:44] <scott_ev_>	So, it's time to start thinking about how we want to organize this event.  I'll need feedback from those of you that attended last time.  And I'm open to input.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:47] <xHans>	tyche: ah, I thought you were on the PLUG-discuss list
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:15:57] <scott_ev_>	We'll need to do alot of planning so we can put on a good show for all attendees.  Remember that the University called it a Windows Removal Event.  That's because the CS dept has migrated to Ubuntu Linux!
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:16:02] <tyche>	I don't believe so.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:16:21] <toddc>	I was there last year
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:16:23] <scott_ev_>	xHans: I should be more active with PLUG and will be in the future
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:16:29] <xHans>	have to be logged in to see those files :(
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:16:42] <Flakeparadigm>	I can mirror them if needed...
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:16:42] <scott_ev_>	We'll need to do alot of planning so we can put on a good show for all attendees.  Remember that the University called it a Windows Removal Event.  That's because the CS dept has migrated to Ubuntu Linux!
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:16:48] <xHans>	tyche: I can add you ;-)
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:17:15] <tyche>	xHans: You don't need to.  You're here, and can add the link, yourself
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:17:19] <tyche>	:-)
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:17:24] <scott_ev_>	xHans: or me if that would be easier
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:17:37] <scott_ev_>	Id imagine they are wondering where we've been since they wanted us to schedule regular installfests.  This would be a great opportunity to promote Ubuntu Linux to students and the general public in Tucson.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:17:53] <scott_ev_>	We'll need fliers, etc. etc. We'll need volunteers for a variety of duties so please please spread the word in channel and via email that we are calling for help.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:18:00] <Flakeparadigm>	http
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:18:06] <scott_ev_>	If no one else steps up and offers to be the main contact point and organizer I'll do it.  I would prefer to have someone anyone living in Tucson volunteer to be the person to make face to face contact with our contacts on campus?  It's over 4 hours round trip for me if I need to drive down there.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:18:07] <Flakeparadigm>	woops. http://tan-com.com/ubuntu/
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:18:21] <hutchnate>	wb MrsApple how's jr?
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:18:21] <scott_ev_>	This weekend hutchnate brought up the point that we need to set some guidelines about hardware requirements for different types of installs at an installfest.  There are regular installs, dual boot installs, Virtual Machine installs, and Wubi installs.  Apparently there was some issue with low powered machines and VM installs.  We really should avoid trying to run into this at the next installfest.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:18:35] <scott_ev_>	lenards, do you have any input about this?
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:18:56] <xHans>	Flakeparadigm: danke
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:19:02] <MrsApple>	hutchnate, hes really good!! hes getting really big and has 2 teeth!! :) hes currently trying to crawl and likes to stay up late even though it makes him cranky. :)
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:19:13] <hutchnate>	yes lenards how do you feel about mac's, and vmware
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:19:26] <scott_ev_>	This weekend hutchnate brought up the point that we need to set some guidelines about hardware requirements for different types of installs at an installfest.  There are regular installs, dual boot installs, Virtual Machine installs, and Wubi installs.  Apparently there was some issue with low powered machines and VM installs.  We really should avoid trying to run into this at the next installfest.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:19:29] <lenards>	whoops
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:19:33] <scott_ev_>	oops
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:19:52] <xHans>	should the flier mention the Installfest?
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:20:07] <scott_ev_>	it could
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:20:16] <scott_ev_>	it's easy to make changes
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:20:20] <lenards>	scott_ev_: I would say that there are likely some reasonable min-reqs for a VM install
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:20:42] <Flakeparadigm>	You can download the ODG file and edit it in OpenOffice. Email it to Scott_ev_ when you like it
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:20:46] <scott_ev_>	xHans: I'll add the installfest to the flyer tonight
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:20:52] <lenards>	like hutchnate is saying... maybe at least a Core 2 Duo or multi core system... and 2 GB +
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:21:03] <lenards>	hutchnate: vmware fusion is actually really nice
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:21:21] <lenards>	hutchnate: I use it at work - but it's pay-to-play... commercial
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:21:34] <Flakeparadigm>	hutchnate: You still loving WinMo? :P
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:21:36] <scott_ev_>	hutchnate: would you mind creating a small doc about this for us since you were there?
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:21:47] <hutchnate>	uh
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:21:53] <lenards>	hutchnate: I would favor VirtualBox for the fact it's open source ... but I don't know it VirtualBox is available for mac
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:22:11] <scott_ev_>	lenards: I'll check on that
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:22:30] <scott_ev_>	hutch, emphasis on small doc
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:22:36] <lenards>	hutchnate: my hatred of mac/virtualization that the particular macbook I had to help w/ .... re the UA installfest in the Fall
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:22:49] <Flakeparadigm>	lenards: vBox is available for mac
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:22:50] <xHans>	scott_ev: danke
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:23:00] <scott_ev_>	xHans: bitte
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:23:05] <lenards>	Flakeparadigm: cool, I wasn't sure...
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:23:09] <toddc>	I usually cover that at install fests while talking to people but many of the show ups have no idea what they need or I find computers that hardware concerns needing parts!
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:23:48] <scott_ev_>	for now, be thinking about these issues.  we still don't have a date set
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:23:55] <MrsApple>	sooo, dont mean to be challenged  but ive been reading the emails and what i got from them is that we have a big install fest coming up soon? i dont have a laptop but.. is there anything i can do to help? aaron and i should be able to make it down.

[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:24:49] <scott_ev_>	I'm proud to announce an Ubucon at SCaLE8X on Friday, February 19th, 2010. An Ubucon is an organized event for Ubuntu users that's halfway between an unconference and a convention. The main focus is for Ubuntu users to get together and meet others, share ideas, and improve their skills.
[Sunday 24 January 2010] [21:24:50] <MrsApple>	ok scott_ev if i have to go you have my email. :)
