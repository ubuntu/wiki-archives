== REST API documentation ==

The appstore will provide a number of APIs clients can talk to. They will be provided by three different services. 

# Ratings & reviews, which should work just like it did before, maybe including some small changes.
# The click package index, which has information about the packages which are available.
# The upgrade checker, which will be a separate service.
