__TOC__

Ubuntu should be accessible to everybody, including the visually impaired. The current state of the ''gnome-accessibility-themes'' package is not acceptable.

You will see that some menu entries and applications are fairly 
complete, while others only partially so. <nowiki>[[http://people.ubuntu.com/~henrik/images/contrast-icons.png|This image]]</nowiki> shows openoffice, 
which is the worst offender not using any high contrast icons at all, 
behind gedit which is complete. There is a bug filed against OpenOffice on this <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org2-amd64/+bug/27191|here]]</nowiki>.

The Ubuntu artwork team should help better this situation. Install the ''gnome-accessibility-themes'' package and get to work!

=== Resources ===
Jakub Steiners original high contrast theme with svgs :http://jimmac.musichall.cz/stuff/high-contrast.tar.bz2. Jakub recommends a 48x48 target size.

Also by Jakub Steiner - a small howto on designing high contrast icons. Might be a good base for some style guidelines: http://jimmac.musichall.cz/doc/high-contrast/html/index.xhtml

=== Testing ===

In his icon guide Jakub recomends the icons be tested by bluring them. This is an example a 15px Gassian blur was applied to an image from the icon development page:

<nowiki>[[File:blur.png]]</nowiki>

And here the image was made gray scale and then blured:

<nowiki>[[File:desaturate+blur.png]]</nowiki>
