== Description ==

This is my hacked version of the creamlooks engine. My hack is based on xl_cheeselooks.
I tried to be as close as possible (for me;-)) to the Union-stuff. Some widgets (buttons, ...) are looking quite Unionish.

There are some features and fixes:

* There was a problem when using a window with a menubar but without a toolbar. Now the menubar looks nice even if there is no toolbar.

* In creamlooks the menu and the menubaritem are looking like one single widget. Compiz/Emerald is the only problem...

* The ugly (my opinion) pattern on notebook-tabs are changed now.

== Concept ==

Here is a screenshot of how it's looking:
