== Hardy Heron Splash ==

Based on a idea of MadsRH, I hope I don't harm any rule, I have made a boot splash on this idea because it seams original.
I hope it will be helpful. Thanks MadsRH!

The main concept would have had this background but with Animated GIFs I couldn't use more than 256 colours.

=== Concept ===
Is based upon the Official color of Ubuntu, with a little change on the logo which I made it a little glossy.

=== Comments ===

* I really love the idea!! very cool. However, I don't think that it would be a good idea to have so many colors in the usplash (you should think on the low end machines)... -- ~~~~
