=== Background ===

I've been involved with Ubuntu since I joined a bunch of Ubuntu fanboys in the French school Institut Supérieur de l'Électronique et du Numérique.  I learnt proper usage of Ubuntu/Debian. 

I am currently applying  for Debian Maintainer status, working on packages such as Callflow <nowiki>[[http://callflow.sourceforge.net/]]</nowiki> or OpenIMSCore <nowiki>[[http://www.openimscore.org]]</nowiki>.

Professionally, I've been working for a big telecoms provider in France for one year, acting as an "Open Source Software guy".

=== Work in Ubuntu / Debian ===
