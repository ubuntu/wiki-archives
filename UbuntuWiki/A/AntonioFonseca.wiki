__TOC__

Hello my name is '''Antonio Fonseca''' and I live at Belem-PA, Brazil.

I am a system administrador, developer and an operating member of the free software and open source local community. 

Here is my blog '''''http://antoniofonseca.wordpress.com'''''

Our community develops some activities of support and spreading the free software and open source philosophy. We develop and support too a lot of software solutions for the companies of the public and private sector in our country.

'''Why Ubuntu?'''

Because I consider it a distribution with an excellent set of resources and capable to satisfy almost any necessities of any type of user.

I can detach some characteristics that please me in special: the fact of it to be based on the venerable Debian project, to immediately offer an excellent usability after a default installation, the almost perfect set of the choices made by the project developers and a very active, increasingly engaged and fast growth community.
