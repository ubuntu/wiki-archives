== Full History ==

The Full History of my involvement, contributions and activities with Ubuntu GNOME Team.

* QA Lead - Leading the Testers of Ubuntu GNOME. While leading a team could be easy but definitely building or establishing a whole new area and recruit 30 members in 2 months is NOT an easy task at all. However, that wasn't impossible and I have managed to do it in less than 3 months - <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugnome-qa | founded the team and recruited the members]]</nowiki>. 
* Create a Wiki Area for Ubuntu GNOME as it is a young project and because of the lack of manpower, there was only <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME | one main page]]</nowiki> for Ubuntu GNOME and therefore, the necessity to create more pages was on the top of my to-do-list - <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOMEOneStopPage#Ubuntu_GNOME_Wiki_Map | See this]]</nowiki>. Now, Ubuntu GNOME Users and Members can enjoy a full Wiki Area and I was lucky to have two fantastic people who joined <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugnome-wiki-docs | Ubuntu GNOME Wiki & Doc]]</nowiki> Team and I must tell you, those two members were one of the best I have ever worked with.
