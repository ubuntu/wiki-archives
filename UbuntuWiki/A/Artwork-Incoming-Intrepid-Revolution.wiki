== Revolution ==

This is essentially a total revamp of the modern user interface. This design is not intended for implementation (though that would be cool) it is more for giving people ideas and proposing that just because it's been done, doesn't mean that it is the best way. (Please note, this was not originally designed for Ubuntu, I just figured I'd share)

=== Concept ===
Revolution is all about changing the way we see computers and making it more accessible to the masses. This theme takes away the utilization of the desktop as a generic folder that your computer boots looking at, but replaces it with a whole structure of resources from the second you access your machine.

=== Comments ===

* I really like the concept here of replacing the desktop. We are already starting to see this idea with the sidebars (Vista, Google, etc.) Eventually the desktop folder will become just another widget, and the 'sidebar' will take up the entire screen. This is definitely worth looking at for Intrepid+1. --eapache
* I think your art has been deleted... -- Brettalton  * This is a great idea! Away with conventional desktop-with-icons! Just one integrated "menu". Has something similar to Konqueror btw, but still, great idea! --GSMX
