21:05 < johnc4510> hope you're feeling ok
21:05 < paul928> hello
21:05 < johnc4510> :)
21:06 < tyche> Oh, good.  Yuma's arrived.  Now we can start.
21:06 < tyche> Hee hee
21:06 < johnc4510> paul928: we've been thinking about you a lot lately
21:06 < johnc4510> .
21:06 < johnc4510> Another manufacturer is adding Ubuntu to it's netbook lineup. ZaReason is now offering it's Terra A20 Netbook for $349. http://www.zareason.com/shop/product.php?productid=16216
21:06 < johnc4510> with ubuntu 9.04 pre-installed
21:06 < johnc4510> .
21:07 < paul928> :)thinking about me?
21:07 < johnc4510> paul928: ah, sorry i was thinking paula
21:07 < johnc4510> oops
21:07 < johnc4510> but welcome
21:07 < tyche> johnc4510: I'm going to tell Paula that you thought she was a guy
21:07 < johnc4510> how's the western edge of AZ
21:07 < johnc4510> tyche: oh thx
21:08 < tyche> Nothing more than you deserve.
21:08 < johnc4510> .
21:08 < johnc4510> I received the two free books that our loco was entitled too. One is on Ubuntu Desktop and the other is on Ubuntu Server. I'm planning on using these as give aways at the ABLEcon in Phoenix. I've also sent for our conference pack from Ubuntu. This usually has some good give aways. pens, stickers.
21:08 < paul928> a bit cooler today, only 103!
21:08 < johnc4510> yeah
21:08 < johnc4510> they keep saying it's _cooler_!!!
21:08 < johnc4510> lol
21:08 < johnc4510> .
21:09 < johnc4510> ok, on to tucson installfest
21:09 < johnc4510> .
21:09 < tyche> It is cooler.  It's only 96 in fountain hills
21:09 < johnc4510> We're be in Gould-Simpson, 9th floor atrium (                                                              http://iiewww.ccit.arizona.edu/uamap/staticLarge/77.html ).  We'll have access to the                      building from 11am to 5pm.  We'll potentially have a room to do projected presentations (just
21:09 < johnc4510>  a few short steps frm the atrium).  Jan (pronounced John) is a student w/ the CSs dept, and                will let us into Gould-Simpson at 10 am to setup. The CS Dept wants to do more InstallFests,               so I conceded on the ILC rooms w/ the thought
21:09 < johnc4510> can everyone read that?
21:10 < tyche> Well, it's a bit disjointed, but it'll pass.  I'll clean it up for the newsletter
21:10 < johnc4510> let me take a sec and clean it up
21:11 < [R]> GS is pretty scary though
21:11 < [R]> with all the windows and such
21:11 < johnc4510> We're be in Gould-Simpson, 9th floor atrium (http://iiewww.ccit.arizona.edu/uamap/staticLarge/77.html ).  We'll have access to the building from 11am to 5pm.  We'll potentially have a room to do projected presentations (just a few short steps from the atrium).  Jan (pronounced John) is a student w/ the CS dept, and will let us into Gould-Simpson at 10 am to setup. The CS Dept wants to do more InstallFests,    so I conceded on the ILC roo
21:11 < johnc4510> .
21:11 < tyche> While you're doing that, I should mention that I've been looking over the U of A requirements for using their logo.  We're going to have to get permission to use it on the flier.
21:12 < johnc4510> great...that could take a while
21:12 < tyche> I hope not.  If all else fails, I'll just use text.
21:12 < johnc4510> does this CS Dept have their own logo
21:12 < johnc4510> tyche: yeah, good idea
21:12 < tyche> Not that I've seen
21:12 < johnc4510> k
21:13 < johnc4510> well, it's suppose to be an open space on the floor, not a room
21:13 < johnc4510> with a good view
21:13 < tyche> At the present time, I'll figure on text.  Then if we can get the permission I can add the big red, white and blue "A"
21:13 < johnc4510> it's on 4th ave which is a main street along the campus
21:13 < johnc4510> k
21:13 < xHans> if the cs dept doesn't have a logo, just use a lolcat picture involving a computer
21:13 -!- fuzzyvader [n=fuzzyvad@cm-24-121-5-191.lakehavasu.az.npgco.com] has left #Ubuntu-US-AZ []
21:14 < todd> will parking be a issue?
21:14 < tyche> I was thinking more of the "Hit any key" graphic.
21:14 < johnc4510> we will have access to a room with a projector if i understood right, that's just off the open space the event will be in
21:14 < johnc4510> i need to find out about parking
21:15 < [R]> there isn't really much good parking by GS, but if it's the weekend all the zone 1 lots are open
21:15 < [R]> so you can park anywhere you want basically... there are metered parking on the street GS is on
21:15 < [R]> i dont know if those are open on the weekends
21:15 < johnc4510> [R]: does that include that new covered lot right by the cross walk on 4th?
21:15 < xHans> how far is GS from the penguin ice cream place across the street from the frog?
21:15 < [R]> i dont know anything thats less than 2 years old
21:16 < [R]> xHans: not very far
21:16 < [R]> but its kinda far
21:16 < [R]> its like halfaway across campus
21:16 < xHans> [R]: too far for a post-event snack?
21:16 < johnc4510> [R]: the crosswalk is right by the laundry and also the bike shop
21:16 < johnc4510> on 4th
21:16 < [R]> xHans: dpeends on how hot it is i guess
21:16  * xHans imagines 50 geeks showing up to a small ice cream shop :)
21:16 < johnc4510> lol
21:17 < tyche> In kilts
21:17 < [R]> lol
21:17 < todd> our out of towners will need to know where to park!----meee
21:17 -!- fuzzyvader [n=fuzzyvad@cm-24-121-5-191.lakehavasu.az.npgco.com] has joined #Ubuntu-US-AZ
21:17 < xHans> tyche: perfect for walking across the street to the frog or down the street a bit to the irish pub
21:17 < johnc4510> well, i'll run by on 4th ave tomorrow and see about parking
21:17 < tyche> Yea, but I don't drink and drive

21:20 < [R]> xHans: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=4th+St&daddr=32.231808,-110.959125&hl=en&geocode=FaXK6wEdSPZi-Q%3B&mra=mi&mrsp=1,0&sz=18&sll=32.231344,-110.957907&sspn=0.002065,0.004823&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=18
21:20 < [R]> xHans: thats approximately gould-simpson to penguins
21:20 < johnc4510> also, the place is right by a wifi node so internet hookup should be good
21:20 < tyche> Nothing you can't get from the newsletter, wednesday
21:21 < fuzzyvader> ok
21:21 < johnc4510> so, what we need now is to get the flyer going
21:21 < xHans> [R]: ok, does the trolley run that route?
21:21 < johnc4510> i need to get the parking access info
21:21 < johnc4510> xHans: no
21:22 < johnc4510> it's farther north
21:22 < [R]> the trolley stops halfway down university before park
21:22 < xHans> bah, UofA makes this hard
21:22 < xHans> not near as hard as ASU makes it, but still...
21:22 < xHans> :)
21:22 < johnc4510> this place is right on 4th ave. from the freeway you exit on st. mary's and then turn left or east
21:22 < paul928> when is the installfest?
21:23 < johnc4510> 29th august
21:23 < johnc4510> sat.
21:23 < johnc4510> we have the room from 11 to 5 i think
21:23 < xHans> SE corner of Euclid and University is where the Irish pub is?
21:24 < azteech> sorry to be late ... lost track of time in a history show ....
21:24 < [R]> xHans: somewhere near there
21:24 < fuzzyvader> giggle me too
21:24 < johnc4510> so, do we want to advertise the event from 11:30 to 4:30 leaving half an hour on each side to set up and tear down?
21:24 < johnc4510> azteech: hey
21:24 < [R]> http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=&daddr=Lowell+St&geocode=FRPF6wEd3vRi-Q&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=32.22844,-110.955327&sspn=0.00413,0.009645&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16
21:24 < azteech> johnc4510 :)
21:24 < tyche> I understood that we'd be able to get in at 10:00
21:24 < [R]> i think that might be zone 1 parking that would be open on saturday
21:24 < xHans> johnc4510: advertise the full time, but mention no new installs after 16:00
21:25 < johnc4510> k
21:25 < Flakeparadigm> Hello.  totally forgot tonight was the meeting
21:26 < azteech> will attempt to be there for the fest .. but also have other commitments that day ... if I make it, my GF will be with me ...
21:26 < fuzzyvader> lol, nobody is punctual, i'm in good company then
21:26 < fuzzyvader> I want to go
21:27 < Flakeparadigm> I'm going to try to make it
21:27 < johnc4510> [R]: that's the covered parking i was talking about i think
21:27 < fuzzyvader> if someone could clarify (tyche was patient with me earlier) fest is for noob and non lnx users... ABLEconf if for commercial...?
21:28 < johnc4510> and i had said 4th ave, but by the college it's 6th
21:28 < johnc4510> the street changes
21:28 < xHans> fuzzyvader: Installfest is for helping people of all levels, but primarily those new or unsure
21:28 < fuzzyvader> k
21:28 < johnc4510> you still exit on st mary's off the freeway
21:28 < Flakeparadigm> hey johnc4510
21:28 < johnc4510> :)
21:28 < tyche> fuzzyvader: It's not quite as clear cut as that.
21:28 < tyche> There is some crossover
21:28 < fuzzyvader> figured as much
21:28 < xHans> ABLEconf is a conference focussed on Free Software for business
21:29 < fuzzyvader> ok
21:29 < tyche> One just has to be prepared.  Hee hee
21:29 < fuzzyvader> lol
21:29 < johnc4510> fuzzyvader: we do installfests for anyone
21:29 < [R]> johnc4510: there is an open lot next to the covered parking
21:29 < [R]> johnc4510: now i know what you are talking about
21:29 < johnc4510> it's a good way to promote ubuntu
21:29 < fuzzyvader> so are we sorting out details of...
21:29 < azteech> lol, tyche ... that is for the boy scouts ....
21:29 < [R]> johnc4510: i dont think that garage is open
21:29 < fuzzyvader> ?
21:29 < johnc4510> [R]: k
21:29 < johnc4510> thx
21:29 < xHans> fuzzyvader: Installfest is a generic event ( there's a monthly Installfest in Phoenix ), but ABLEconf is a specific conference
21:30 < johnc4510> [R]: you said zone 1 is open on sat?
21:30 < fuzzyvader> ok
21:30 < [R]> johnc4510: yeah, if you goto the parking and transportation website, they should have a map
21:30 < fuzzyvader> these dates and parking issues are for which?
21:30 < [R]> of all the zone 1 lots
21:30 < fuzzyvader> (i'm late my apologies)
21:30 < [R]> lemme get you a link
21:30 < johnc4510> fuzzyvader: ableconf is promoting open source computing in AZ whether it's ubuntu or another
21:30 < [R]> http://parking.arizona.edu/
21:30 < johnc4510> fuzzyvader: for the installfest in tucson
21:30 < xHans> fuzzyvader: thus far all the talk has been about the upcoming Installfest in Tucson
21:31 < fuzzyvader> gotcha thx
21:31 < johnc4510> [R]: thx for the parking info
21:31 < johnc4510> :)
21:31 < johnc4510> scott_ev: you here
21:31 < scott_ev> yes
21:32 < [R]> johnc4510: np
21:32 < matthewmpp> Good to see you again scott.
21:32 < scott_ev> hey matthewmpp
21:32 < johnc4510> scott_ev: we need to know if we can use the u of a logo to advertise on the flyer
21:33 < johnc4510> or just say the CS Dept of the u of a
21:33 < scott_ev> actually i think we should
21:33 < johnc4510> yeah but we may need permission
21:33 < scott_ev> well, but just listing the u of a cd dept would be safer
21:33 < [R]> johnc4510: i'm trying to think of who you would need to clear that through
21:33 < johnc4510> scott_ev: also, we need to know if they want flyers to hand out or put in the dept for people to take
21:34 < johnc4510> how many and where to deliver them
21:34 < johnc4510> :)
21:34 < scott_ev> ok, I'll know asap
21:34 < johnc4510> thx
21:34 < johnc4510> [R]: thx
21:34 < tyche> And do you want me to make them up full page or half page.
21:34 < scott_ev> I'd say full
21:34 < tyche> OK
21:34 < johnc4510> tyche: half pages i think...then we can cut them in half
21:35 < johnc4510> ooops
21:35 < johnc4510> ok, i guess we need to discuss that
21:35 < tyche> OK, that's got me totally confused.  Hee hee
21:35 < Flakeparadigm> Wow, I just got distracted by that google maps link :P
21:35 < johnc4510> the only reason i said half was to save paper cost
21:36 < johnc4510> but it doesn't matter to me
21:36 < johnc4510> ? will we have enought info to cover a whole page tyche
21:36 < tyche> I'm not sure I could give you enough separation in half pages.  I can try.  It could involve a lot of cutting.
21:36 < scott_ev> true, It may really not matter
21:36 < johnc4510> tyche: ok
21:36 < scott_ev> but full pages would be easier to read
21:36 < johnc4510> then lets go whole pages then
21:37 < tyche> Oh, sure.  In fact, with the address, it would be easier to do full page.
21:37 < johnc4510> k, do that then
21:37 < tyche> OK Full page it is.
21:37 < johnc4510> don't pay any attention to me LOL
21:37 < johnc4510> :)
21:37 < scott_ev> did everyone get a good look at the map I gave john?
21:37 < scott_ev> http://iiewww.ccit.arizona.edu/uamap/staticLarge/77.html
21:37 < tyche> I don't pay anything I don't have to.
21:38 < johnc4510> scott_ev: yeah i posted it
21:38 < johnc4510> thx
21:38 < scott_ev> isn't park for anyone on weekends?
21:38 < [R]> johnc4510: http://logos.arizona.edu/ have you seen that site?
21:38 < scott_ev> or is it student/faculty on weekends too?
21:38 < johnc4510> scott_ev: we're not sure but we think zone 1 lots are
21:38 < [R]> zone 1 lots are open to anyone on the weekends
21:38 < johnc4510> [R]: looking
21:39 < scott_ev> well, we can always ask jan o when we show up
21:39 < scott_ev> most of the attendees are likely to already know what the rules are
21:39 < johnc4510> [R]: thx
21:40 < johnc4510> yes, we are pushing on campus attendance
21:40 < scott_ev> so are teh CS dept
21:40 < johnc4510> but for most team members we'll need to know about parking
21:40 < scott_ev> they realy think this will help them alot
21:40 < johnc4510> and it should be in the flyer
21:40 < scott_ev> true
21:40  * slofgren hopes it goes well

21:48 < xHans> the shell scripting is not yet an online class
21:48 < johnc4510> yeah if he gave you a link it should be good
21:48 < fuzzyvader> lol bummer :( MCC = Mohave... here
21:48 < xHans> tyche: yeah, sometimes I think I give my students whiplash

21:49 < tyche> That's not information, xHans, that "attitude adjustment"

21:50 < fuzzyvader> THEY DO!
21:50 < fuzzyvader>  well atleast one does
21:50 < xHans> fuzzyvader: the OOo class is online, so you can take it from anywhere, being in Arizona probably makes signing up easier
