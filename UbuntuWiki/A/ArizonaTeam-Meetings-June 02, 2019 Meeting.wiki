We have nine clunkers to work on in various states of disrepair. Our first objective is to determine what power supplies they will need. Second, what memory they have and if they have a working hard drive. We will probably be switching out memory and hard drives to determine what in fact is workin

(Like install an operating system) In addition a small screwdriver that will work on those tiny screws one finds in the back of laptops would be helpful. I have some old memory and hard drives. W
