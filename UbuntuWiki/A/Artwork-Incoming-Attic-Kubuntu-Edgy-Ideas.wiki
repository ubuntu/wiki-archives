Here is a screenshot with an updated window decoration gradient, the new color scheme (see below) and new buttons for the normal state:

<nowiki>[[File:konqiScreen.png]]</nowiki>

The vision I have for Kubuntu Edgy is defined by use of color (purple and blue), texture (bubbles and/or a real pic and/or a mix of the two) and effect (gloss)
A pic from my current desktop might explain better than any words can. I really like the color usage in the wallpaper. The purple blends well with the blue and is highlighted very well by the yellow-orange of the flower. Even the green of the stem, etc. looks nice.

==== Colors ====

Here is the KDE color file that I was using (matches the flower pic).

Here is a new color scheme file which matches the current wallpaper in now

<nowiki>[[attachment:Edgy_Color_Knot2.kcsrc]]</nowiki>

==== Window Decoration ====

Here are the gradients I have tested so far for a new look to the kubuntu style we started with dapper. Be sure to use the color file (above) to test them

==== Window Buttons ====

The window buttons needed to be improved to fit with the style. Here are some ideas...

<nowiki>[[File:buttons-normal-grey.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:buttons-pressed-grey1.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:right_button.png]]</nowiki>

==== KDE App start pages ====

I suggest modifying the KDE app start pages to fit more into the overall theme. This pic shows what kind of changes can be made, not the changes I would make now.

<nowiki>[[File:lighterblue.jpg]]</nowiki>

==== branding/logo usage ====

I have thought of a couple of logo and title graphic ideas as well.

==== KDM/Login splash screens ====

Two ideas for KDM and the login splash. The idea behind these pics is to discover the fine aspects of light and dark, in relation to the gloss effect.

The SVG has an updated logo!
<nowiki>[[attachment:kdm-edgy4.svg]]</nowiki>

Here is the latest stuff I made, showing a representation of Who's wallpaper (made my way, very quickly) and a KDM design with the logo idea I posted here as well. Squint your eyes and try to imagine a row of icons with text below on the inner box

==== Shutdown screen from MHB ====

Here is a proposal from mhb for the KDE shutdown screen. It tries to resemble the KDM login screen and also the shutdown dialog in Ubuntu while preserving all the information and functionality of the default KDE shutdown dialog.

<nowiki>[[File:shutdown-edgy1.png]]</nowiki> 

==== Wallpapers ====
This is an idea based on Who's bubble pic I found on kde-look.org. Also used in the kdm mockup on this page. Updated, with color variations - -- KennethWimer 

<nowiki>[[File:bg_variations.jpg]]</nowiki>

Here is another simple idea with some of the same variations of color (check http://bootsplash.org/edgyWallpaper.tar.gz for the full size pics)

<nowiki>[[File:bg_variations2.jpg]]</nowiki>

This is idea is based on a pic I took with my digicam. I like the use of color and contrast in this pic.

<nowiki>[[File:bg.jpg]]</nowiki>

This is roughly based on the default kde bg although somewhat updated :-)

<nowiki>[[File:edgy3.png]]</nowiki>

This is a variation on the dapper theme

==== Panel Background ====

<nowiki>[[File:glosspanel_kubuntu.jpg]]</nowiki>

Hopefully this should go nice with everything else...looks best with the colorize option enabled.

I have a wallpaper proposal. Aiming for something that was more professional and abstract, I believe that this is a good graphical representation of kubuntu's philosophy. I also have a separate image to be used with kdm and/or the splash.

Since I prefer the blue colorscheme i've made a desktop proposal. I believe you like this. Wallpaper is simply the blue-colored version of the default human wallpapers. Nuvola icons match with the blue-ish theme and a transparent kicker for your eyes.

<nowiki>[[File:kubuntu02-arbiter.png]]</nowiki>

Same as before but with some konqueror windows opened.

I propose my Advanced QtCurve style: http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=45123

==== Konqueror Metabar ====

I propose this metabar theme for konqueror, and possibly for amarok.
