We have received word today that our shipment of CDs from Ubuntu has been mailed, so we should be receiving it shortly. I'll let everyone know when they arrive. It is an assortment of CDs that includes different versions and architectures for our team to use to advocate for Ubuntu.

==== Summary of the June 15, 2008 meeting ====

johnc4510 called the meeting to order at 8:57 PM

The agenda for the meeting was at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Meetings/08June15.

For the first order of business johnc4510 talked about the Drupal project he and tyche had been working on.  Each had downloaded the Drupal package from the repositories and had been learning how to use it.  This is so the Team would be ready to put up a site as soon as it got an address on the Ubuntu servers.  We are permitted a web address because we are now an approved team.  johnc4510 put up links to work that he and tyche had already managed to do, to show the Team what progress they'd made.  johnc4510's is at {{http://s204.photobucket.com/albums/bb24/johnc4510/?action=view&current=first_go1.png}} and tyche's is at http://www.flickr.com/photos/22090195@N03/2581571693/sizes/l/.  paul928 offered john a site he'd worked on, at http://ubuntu-az.nfshost.com/, and will be sending johnc4510 the database and Drupal site.  He created his in a more advanced version of Drupal, so it may not go directly into the version we have.  However, it may still be useful.

The next order of business was the fliers for the Open Source Conference, to be held in the fall.  johnc4510 then put up the links to the logos and fliers that he and tyche had made.

These are only prototypes, for the purpose of discussion and suggestions.  Nothing has yet been finalized, and we would welcome the input from the entire Team.  One possibility was to put the logos for the sponsors and LUGS around the edges of the flier.  soldats offered to also put something together as a flier.  tyche offered to send soldats the LUG logos for his use.  Luft``Hans suggested that we use a different name than "oscon", and that is one of the things that the Team will be considering.  The idea of using "AZ FLOSS con" was ruled out, on the basis that we would get a bunch of dental hygienists.  Likewise "Phoenix Open" was ruled out due to threats of filling tyche's Jeep with golf balls.  Committees will be set up to work on naming, marketing, and organizing.  Luft``Hans volunteered to look into setting up a mailing list so that LUG personnel would be able to join in the discussions.

The third order of business was the Global Bug Jam.  The second item in the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter #95 (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue95) has more information on it.  This is to work on bugs that have been registered with Launchpad.  Luft``Hans felt that the LUGS might be interested in helping with something like this.  However, it was left that johnc4510 would do more research into the Bug Jam, to see what type of work needed to be done, and whether the Team members would be able to do it.  This matter was tabled until next week.

The parting words were from Luft``Hans.  There will be a Stammtische this Tuesday, in both Tempe and Avondale.  More information can be found at http://www.LuftHans.com/Free_Software_Stammtisch.

The meeting was adjourned at 10:08 PM.
