* '''Created''':  * '''Contributors''': JohnBaer

=== Summary ===

Currently Artwork effort is splintered and unorganized with tasks falling to individuals or groups with limited communication or collaboration. Although there is a desire by members to contribute processes are ill defined and confusing.

=== Rationale ===

Re-organize the Artwork Team in a manner which encourages inclusion, provides a recognition of effort, and facilitates collaboration to achieve the desired result. Processes must be well defined and agreed to satisfy the fast pace of the release cycle. Requirements ( colors, size, audience ) and schedule ( current release, current release +1, specific date ) must be defined prior to the development.

=== Use Cases ===

** Default Wallpapers

** Countdown Banners

** Supplemental Wallpapers

** Logo Designs

** Individual Icons / Icon Sets

** Documentation Illustrations

** Web Artwork

** Marketing Posters

** Marketing Ads

** Sound Themes

=== Scope ===

The scope of this effort is limited to the Artwork Team. 

=== Design ===

The design of this spec is focused on process improvement and tool identification.

==== Summary ====

Define the processes for requesting and submitting artwork and the desired tools to support these processes.

==== Rationale ====

This desired outcome of this specification is to improve the processes of the Art Team to encourage participation.

==== Scope and Use Cases ====

===== Actors =====

====== Owner ======

* The owner is the individual, or a person representing a group, which submits the request. The owner is responsible for defining requirements and the schedule. In the case requirements are unknown, the team may assist in their discovery.<<BR>><<BR>>''Roles'': Initiate request, advise team, approve effort

====== Facilitator/Assignee ======

** The facilitator is a member of the Artwork Team who accepts responsibility to complete the task. The facilitator will solicit inclusion and lead others in achieving the desired result.<<BR>><<BR>>''Roles'': Propose ideas, accept responsibility, identify processes, coach members

====== Team Member ======

** An individual who agrees to create submissions or contribute to the solution (viz. build packages) as coached by the facilitator.<<BR>><<BR>>''Roles'': create submissions, complete tasks

<<BR>>
<pre>
    <!> An individual may have more than one role (viz. Facilitator & Team Member)

===== Use Cases =====

====== Ubuntu Countdown Banner ======

''Owner:''  
* Web Presence Team represented by "Matthew Nuzum"

''Goal:''  
* Leverage the Internet to inform users of the number of days until the next release of Ubuntu.

''Objective:'' 
* Create an image ("Banner") displaying the number of days from Beta to the final release. Typically 38 images are created numbered "38 - 1" plus one for day "0" that says "coming soon" and one more that says "it's here" (40 images total).
''Process:''
1. Submit request to the mailing list with requirements and schedule
*** Determine priority
*** Determine facilitator/assignee
2. Create blueprint on Launchpad
3. Create spec on Wiki to explain submission guidelines
4. Solicit members from the list to create submissions, post to repository as described in spec
5. Judge submissions to select the successful candidates
6. Announce results on the list

====== Xubuntu Default Wallpaper ======

''Owner:''  
* Xubuntu Community represented by "Jakob Pfister"

''Goal:''  
* Enhance the Xubuntu user experience with a wallpaper which satisfies the stated goals of the release.

''Objective:'' 
** Create an image ("Wallpaper") utilizing a blue pallet which can be generally described as light and refreshing. The successful implementation will be a single image which is not dependent upon aspect ratio and will display as desired on a variety of screen sizes.

''Process:''
1. Submit request to the mailing list with requirements and schedule
*** Determine priority
*** Determine facilitator/assignee
2. Create blueprint on Launchpad
3. Create spec on Wiki to explain submission guidelines
4. Solicit members from the list to create submissions, post to repository as described in spec
5. Judge submissions to select the successful candidate
6. Announce results on the list

==== Implementation Plan ====

<nowiki>[[File:ArtTeamToolSet.jpg]]</nowiki>

'''Communication'''<<BR>>
* Communication occurs primarily through the "ubuntu-art" list although the IRC is available. The desired process is to register a blueprint on <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-art|Launchpad]]</nowiki> with notes posted to the whiteboard. 

'''Documentation'''<<BR>>
* The desired repository for all documentation is the Wiki. Each blueprint should have a specification posted as a reference.

'''Tracking'''<<BR>>
* Progress is tracked in Launchpad where milestones are identified and blueprints created. 

'''Repository'''<<BR>>
* Artwork is stored on a variety of third party sites such a <nowiki>[[http://www.flickr.com/groups/ubuntu-artwork/|flickr]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-artists.deviantart.com/|deviantart]]</nowiki>.

=== Implementation ===

'''Process'''<<BR>>
** At a high level the community makes a request or a member submits a proposal to the team. The request or proposal is logged and the supporting documentation created. A priority is assigned based on need and urgency and volunteers are solicited to accept tasks and to create submissions. The successful submission(s) is determined as prescribed and the request is closed or the proposal is accepted.

'''Tools'''<<BR>>
** A complete set of well defined tools does not exist forcing a reliance on third party sites. The desire is to use the mailing list for general discussion and the IRC for meetings. Launchpad should serve adequately to track requests and the Wiki for documentation. The repository or repositories for submissions is open to discussion.

=== Outstanding Issues ===

1. Agreed and documented processes<<BR>>
2. Identify or create the required tools

<<BR>>
<pre>

    <!> Some issues with Wiki have been identified relative to performance. For the purpose of this discussion assume the wiki will function as desired. :)

</pre>

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

 A public session on this topic will be held Tuesday 2010/10/26, 15:00 UTC, at UDS-N in the Bonaire 4 meeting room.
