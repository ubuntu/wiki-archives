== Welcome ==
This is the home page for the Australian Ubuntu Local Community Team. 

=== Mission Statement ===
The Australian Ubuntu Team (Ubuntu-AU) is united by a commitment to the philosophy of Ubuntu and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software).

We therefore advocate freedom from the constraints of proprietary software and enjoy the power to make our own choices to meet our computing needs.

Ubuntu-Au provides a common hub to share ideas, resources and experiences to enable localised Ubuntu user groups to distribute, advertise, promote and demonstrate Ubuntu throughout Australia. 

=== Details ===
Please see <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.org.au|our website]]</nowiki> for the latest news on our activities and events!  For other activities check out our <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-au|Launchpad Page]]</nowiki>
