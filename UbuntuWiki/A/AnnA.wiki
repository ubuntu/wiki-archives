__TOC__

I'm windows programmer seeking to make the switch. My goals are to get involved in open source development and contribute to Ubuntu along with Eclipse, Mozilla, and anything else that catches my interest.

So the question is what do I want to work on?  What are my Linux programming goals?  Are they application driven, language driven, or do I just want to jump in to the first thing I see ''(Bazaar)''?
