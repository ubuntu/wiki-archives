I am a 30 year old software developer from Auckland New Zealand.

Currently we use Ubuntu desktop and server editions extensively within our work environment (both internal and customer boxes).

Hoping to learn more about Ubuntu and also contribute as best as I can.

===== JBoss =====
Ubuntu packages for <nowiki>[[JBoss]]</nowiki>.<<BR>>
''Draft'' thoughts are on <nowiki>[[AntonioBroughton/JBoss]]</nowiki>

===== OpenDS =====
Ubuntu packages for <nowiki>[[OpenDS]]</nowiki>.<<BR>>
''Draft'' thoughts are on <nowiki>[[AntonioBroughton/OpenDS]]</nowiki>
