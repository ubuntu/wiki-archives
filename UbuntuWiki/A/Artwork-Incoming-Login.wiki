=== Creating New Login Experience for Ubuntu ===

The login experience is an important part of interaction with the system; a gateway to the user's personal account and an opportunity to reinforce Ubuntu brand and its values. The current solution leaves a feeling of unfulfilled promise and does not provide a truly delightful experience. There are few fundamental goals that the new Face Browser should achieve:            

* To provide a responsive, reliable and easy-to-use interface to log into the system            
* To wow and delight end users            
* To make Ubuntu login experience unique, different and simply amazing!

==== Iteration 2 [GDM] edit by mac_v ====
* Just an idea for the gdm. I'v not changed anything else , only the gdm has been altered.
* The present gdm doesn't seem to use the space provided by the boot , the boot seems to occur in a room with light from above but the gdm just hangs in front.

So I'v *tried* to use the space  and create a 3rd dimention to the gdm list.
* The idea is to have the selected option grow and move forward. [rather than a simple highlight]
* For list with more than 5 items  , we could use> http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/fisheyemenu/ [thorwil]

''Sidenote: For a11y reasons I have not changed the text size of the other non-selected items , but rather only increased the size of the selected item. [Maybe the non-selected item's text could be a bit smaller , size 12?]'' --mac_v
