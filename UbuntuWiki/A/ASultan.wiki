== About Me ==

My name is Ahmed Sultan. I live in menofia Egypt but almost all the time I'm hanging out in cairo :). I started out as a java developer, then moved to android development but now I'm more in python development for linux. 
I started using Redhat in year 2004, but was too alien place for me with the lose of some of my data after false formatting :D . after that I left linux for 4 years then started studding operation system in my collage which drew me back to linux but these time I searched for the best distro for me and that was UBUNTU, then I decided to help others to see  how easy and wonderful ubuntu is so I joined the UBUNTU-EG team and now I am an active member of the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/EgyptTeam|Ubuntu-EG]]</nowiki> LoCo team.

I have been working with Ubuntu-eg since 2011 and had such a great time with the team since then.
