21:04 < johnc4510> jk
21:04 < scott_ev> I'll have something posted before next meeting
21:04 < johnc4510> LoCo Directory Moves Forward: Jono Bacon shows off screen shots of the new LoCo directory. The idea was to take the information from the LoCo Team List, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamList, and gather it in a database that was easier to read and access. This is still a work in progress.
21:04 < johnc4510> scott_ev: great
21:04 < johnc4510> on the new site please :)
21:04 < scott_ev> yes
21:05 < johnc4510> k
21:05 < johnc4510> so we're getting a new interface for the LoCo directory
21:05 < scott_ev> I've spent too much chasin bugs and not docmmenting how
21:05 < johnc4510> k
21:05 < johnc4510> With Jaunty not far off here is a series of 4 good tutorials on encrypted home directories by Dustin Kirkland. Dustin is a core developer of Ubuntu.
21:05 < johnc4510> .
21:05 < johnc4510> Jaunty encrypted home directories: http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/02/jaunty-encrypted-home-directories.html
21:06 < johnc4510> .
21:06 < johnc4510> How eCryptfs Works: http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/02/how-encrypted-home-ecryptfs-works.html
21:06 < johnc4510> .
21:06 < scott_ev> read them, he's really good
21:06 < johnc4510> Mounting Encrypted Home using a LiveCD: http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/03/mounting-your-encrypted-home-from.html
21:06 < johnc4510> .
21:06 < johnc4510> Ubuntu Encrypted home with 2 factor authentication: http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/03/ubuntu-encrypted-home-with-2-factor.html
21:06 < johnc4510> .
21:07 < johnc4510> ok, justin kirkland is really good at this. It's one of the things he's been developing for Ubuntu
21:08 < johnc4510> since jaunty won't have the .29 kernel which supports encryption on ext 4 out of the box
21:08 < johnc4510> you'll have to use these tutorials to get it working right
21:08 < johnc4510> kernel .29 was not ready by the freeze
21:09 < johnc4510> .
21:09 < johnc4510> Many of these links can be found in the new issue of the UWN #132 here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue132

21:10 < johnc4510> Our new website: 18 registered users, 220 hits so far. A new poll on what version of Ubuntu do you use?
