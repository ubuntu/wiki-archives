=== About me ===
My name is Ahmed, I'm 23 years old, I live in Cairo, Egypt.<<BR>>
In brief, I'm an author and interested in economy, free/open source software, art of Arabic calligraphy and environmental and social issues. I believe that '''“Details Matter”''' and '''“Less Talk Means More Action”'''.

I've been writing for the technical field since 2005, and fully Ubuntu user since 2008. Since this time I'm trying to spread Ubuntu across Egypt and the whole Arabic World. I'm also a member of the Ubuntu LoCo Team in Egypt (<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-eg.org/|Ubuntu-eg]]</nowiki>).

I wrote many technical articles/tutorials about Ubuntu, Linux and Free/Open Source software. But what makes me most proud is my book “<nowiki>[[http://www.simplyubuntu.com/|SimplyUbuntu]]</nowiki>”.

* I have been familiar with Ahmed's work for some years now. He's very enthusiastic, level headed and truly believes in openness and freedom. His book “Simply Ubuntu” helped us a lot in spreading the usage of Ubuntu in Egypt. Since its release we recommend it to new comers who become more familiar with the system in small time by following the book. I believe he deserves to get Ubuntu membership.
