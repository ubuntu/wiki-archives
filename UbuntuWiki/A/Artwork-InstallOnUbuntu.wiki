__TOC__

== What is It? ==

Install On Ubuntu is a documentation project to share how best projects and partners can display on their websites an install button. This includes a description of how apt links work, a guide for gracefully falling back and a set of default graphics that anyone can use.

== Examples of issue ==

On http://inkscape.org/download/?lang=en the project recommends that 'Linux' users download a source tarball. This isn't friendly and tarnishes all the hard work that is put into getting inkscape into the repository.

== Art: Default Install Buttons ==

Please document your graphics here, put only one in-page example and link to the rest of your graphics as an archive.
