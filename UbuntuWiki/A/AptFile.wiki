__TOC__

Apt-file is able to tell you which package a given file belongs to, this includes both installed and not yet installed packages available to your system. Apt-file uses the same database as AutoApt and needs to be updated separately to your normal apt-get package lists. To update the AptFile/AutoApt database run:

<pre>
sudo apt-file update
</pre>

To find what package a given file belongs to, you can do:

<pre>
apt-file search <filename>
</pre>

Replace ''<filename>'' above with the file name you wish to search for, example "/usr/bin/batch".

You can also list the files in a given package:

<pre>
apt-file list <packagename>
</pre>

Replace ''<packagename>'' with the name of the package you wish to list the contents of.
