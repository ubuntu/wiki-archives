=== About Me ===

Hi there! My name is Adam and I'm 21 years old. I come from a <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashville%2C_Ohio|small town in central Ohio]]</nowiki>, though I'm currently attending <nowiki>[[http://www.miami.muohio.edu/|Miami University]]</nowiki>. I'm a bit of a geek, but in an affable way.

I first started using Ubuntu after I read about it on the popular blog <nowiki>[[http://www.lifehacker.com/|Lifehacker]]</nowiki>. I'm currently booting Gutsy on a desktop computer I built myself. However, I'm probably not someone you should ask for help, as I still have a lot of exploring to do on my own before I can be considered "knowledgable".

'''Aliases:''' hackle577, Fiz''''''Zle

science, movies, the Internet, politics, frisbee, Linux, good music, reading, NPR
