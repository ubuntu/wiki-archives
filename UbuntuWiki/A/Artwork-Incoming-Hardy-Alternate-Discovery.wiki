== Discovery Icon Theme ==
Because Ubuntu probably won't go with a Tango styled theme (which is a shame, because almost all popular applications have adopted the Tango style) this theme is designed to ship as an alternate theme to the default. The theme is still a work in progress, trying to cover all icons in the Ubuntu default install/live cd. You can get the theme here: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Discovery+Icon+Theme?content=69950

=== Concept ===
Discovery is a Tango styled theme that is inspired by the following concepts to get to the "Ubuntu Feel": Jungle, Safari, Survival, Classical, Ancient. Using more ancient , yet clear, metaphors than are normally used, it tries to create it's own atmosphere (navigation items, palmtrees, wood, etc.).

Colors are used of the offcial Ubuntu Palette and Tango Palette.
