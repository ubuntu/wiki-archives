=== About Me ===
I'm from Budapest, Hungary, but I was born in Transylvania. I study media and communications, and I work for one of the biggest online stores in the world. I am a big fan of music, and I also run amateur radio shows on an online radio station as it's one of the many things that make me feel relaxed.

=== My Contributions to the Ubuntu Community ===
I rarely help on the Hungarian Ubuntu LoCo teams channel {{https://launchpad.net/@@/language}} <nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net-ubuntu-hu|#ubuntu-hu]]</nowiki> and on the Romanian Ubuntu LoCo teams channel {{https://launchpad.net/@@/language}} <nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net-ubuntu-ro|#ubuntu-ro]]</nowiki>. I got '''approved''' as a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam|Beginners Team]]</nowiki> member, and I do help in the main channel on IRC ({{https://launchpad.net/@@/language}} <nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net-ubuntu-beginners|#ubuntu-beginners]]</nowiki>). My beans have been multiplying on the {{https://launchpadlibrarian.net/7171615/ubuntulogo_s.png}} UbuntuForums also. Other then this, I help on the <nowiki>[[http://www.undernet.org|Undernet]]</nowiki> channel {{https://launchpad.net/@@/language}} <nowiki>[[irc:--eu.undernet.org|#ubuntu]]</nowiki> and anywhere else I can.

=== Future Plans ===
In the near future I'd like to learn how to code, the development of applications is something I'm interested in, but for now I know nothing more than basic html, php. I wish to help people more, because I got lots of help from the Ubuntu community, if I can, I'd like to give it back.

=== Application for #ubuntu-offtopic Op status ===

Currently I'm spending a lot of time on IRC in {{https://launchpad.net/@@/language}} <nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net-ubuntu-beginners|#ubuntu-beginners]]</nowiki>, as I'm a member of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-beginners-irc|IRC Focus Group]]</nowiki>. I've been on IRC for 10 years now, across multiple networks, gaining experience. Through these years I got attached to IRC even more, thanks to friends, projects and other hobbies, just like Ubuntu. My application is being filed because I'd like to give something back to the Ubuntu community, and of course, I'd like to learn further more about the community, especially the IRC part.

I spend most of my free time on IRC, so on weekdays from 9AM until 6PM CET. Being a human being, I can't hold that thought, so I'd say I'm here mostly during day time.

=== Testimonials ===
I've had the pleasure of working with Akos in the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam|Beginners Team]]</nowiki> for some time now. Many times we've seen Akos helping out beginners in our main IRC channel, which is what we're here for. I believe he has the necessary responsibility to acquire op status or any other project he may wander upon in the future. <nowiki>[[pedro3005]]</nowiki>

What can I say about Akos that will do him justice? I've worked with him extensively in the <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam|Beginners Team]]</nowiki> AND the <nowiki>[[UbuntuYouth|Ubuntu Youth Team]]</nowiki> for many months now...he's a great help to not only the beginners but also the more experienced user as well, providing ideas, insight, and assistance where and when it's needed. He's got my full support in any endeavor he chooses, whether it's an application for Ubuntu Membership, op status in the Lubuntu channel(s), and so on...way to go Akos! ~<nowiki>[[zkriesse]]</nowiki> (Zach Kriesse) 
I know Akos for about three years, he is a very patient and helpful, and he has a great sense of humor:) If he is not eligible to be an operator, then nobody is. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:ulysses]]</nowiki> 
Akos spends a lot of time on the ''#ubuntu-beginners'' channel, where he gives assistance to the beginner Ubuntu users. I had the chance to work with him on other projects several times. I know him as a reliable and patient person, so in my opinion he could act as a moderator of the ''#ubuntu-offtopic'' channel. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:bognarandras]]</nowiki>

I think I have to write an essay here to tell about the activities of Akos to Ubuntu Community and the <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam|Beginners Team]]</nowiki>. Akos is really an interactive, active, Helpful and a good man. I endorse his application for "-offtopic" Moderating and for any further steps he takes in our community. <nowiki>[[Mohan_chml| Mohi]]</nowiki> Nov 4 17:43:19 UTC 2010

I've watched Akos join, participate and contribute in a positive way during his time with the Beginners Team. His history with the team is spotless, a truly model member. His contagiously lightweight personality is a true asset when dealing with disenfranchised users. Much like his time with the Beginners Team, I believe, without reserve, that Akos has what it takes to preform the duty of channel operator with distinction and dedication. Please consider his application favorably. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:paultag]]</nowiki>
