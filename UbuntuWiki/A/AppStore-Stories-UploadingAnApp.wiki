__TOC__

Variations: Manually, and from “SDK” (do we really mean Quickly?)

Variations: Interpreted packages (e.g. Qt Quick), native packages, multi-arch.

Variations: Apps that include sources for license compliance, or include a source-URL in the metadata (Akexander Sacks in e-mail “click/appstore PRD questions” on 2013-06-12 calls this a must-have for 13.10).

Can we support automatic approval for apps needing no special permissions?  Or even for apps requiring special permissions?  Would we approve by default, or automatically test apps in some sort of sandbox?
