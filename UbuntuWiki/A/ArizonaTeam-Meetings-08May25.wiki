[Sun May 25 2008] [21:37:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	suggestions
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:37:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	etc
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:37:44] <tyche>	Do we want to discuss creating a theme for Gnome?
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:37:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:37:53] <word>	*sneeze*
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:38:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	we can
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:38:12] <tyche>	Yea, word.  That's about what I thought when I saw some of what it involved.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:38:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	if you want
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:38:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: you want to expand on that?
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:38:33] <tyche>	I've only just gotten my toes in the water on this one.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:38:36] <word>	tyche: i didn't even bring the thought that far, i just saw the word gnome :P
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:38:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	what's involved
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	who's idea was that anyway?
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:06] <kennymc0>	word you could make one for kde so we can expand on the idea some :P
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	was it paul928's
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:08] <tyche>	But so far, There's one LARGE xml file that I've got to see what I can do with.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:13] <word>	tyche: are you thinking icons/desktop/window decorator?
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:27] <kennymc0>	also including pages in firefox and stuff
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:46] <kennymc0>	so that when they open firefox it comes up with our team pages and stuff
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:49] <tyche>	This was a possibility suggested by hans, that we create a theme for gnome, and also pages or page as a FireFox home page.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:39:59] <tyche>	The theme should be very Arizonan
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:40:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:40:06] <kennymc0>	yeah i think i overheard him talking about it
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:40:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, one thing i want to put in here
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:40:21] <tyche>	Right now, I'm in the information gathering stage.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:40:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	if we get approved, we will be getting bulk shipments of CDs from Canonical
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:40:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	so
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:41:10] <word>	tyche: wanna invite hans in the channel to talk about what it involves? or maybe ask him to be in here next meeting?
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:41:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	the theme would have to be something like an add on maybe
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:41:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: did you see my above statement?
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:41:41] <tyche>	Definitely as an add-on.  I don't think we're equipped to brand the entire disk
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:41:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	agreed
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:41:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	so
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:42:04] <tyche>	And I wouldn't want to.  This should be something that people can choose.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:42:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe we could demo the theme at the Intrepid release and installfest parties
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:42:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	and
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:42:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	offer it via the server
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:42:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	as a download
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:42:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	or
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:42:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	we could waste disks and burn the theme
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:06] <tyche>	OK, I'll continue researching, and see what I can come up with, and what I'll need help with.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	i personlly like the first idea
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:22] <tyche>	I think download would be best.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: great
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	yep
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	it would be like a package
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:46] <tyche>	I'll try to keep you informed of where I'm at with it, then.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	where we offer the deb
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:43:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	np
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:02] <tyche>	Now - is this something that you would want to add to the approval?
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	thx
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think so
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	i had forgot about it
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:27] <tyche>	OK.  Now you see why I brought it up.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	there was a lot of info to initially put on the page
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	sure
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	thx
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:49] <tyche>	The Firefox page would be a "Help" page type of thing.  That would be the easiest to do.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:44:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	nice
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:45:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	would that be like a home page that the browser auto opens too?
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:45:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	is that the idea
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:45:27] <tyche>	So if anyone wants to take that on, I'll concentrate on the idea of the theme.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:45:51] <tyche>	Yep.  again, something that they could select.  A Help for new users.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:46:01] <tyche>	Where to go, what to do, sort of thing.
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:46:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, lets work on the theme first and see how that pans out
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:46:15] <word>	you could get a google adsense account for the team and integrate a google search engine into the branded firefox homepage and make money for the team with it :-/
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:46:16] <tyche>	kk
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:47:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	word: can you get me the particulars on that and present them at the next meeting??
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:47:58] <word>	sure ;p
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:48:18] <johnc4510-laptop>	would that involve having ads on one of our pages word ??
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:48:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	word: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:48:54] <word>	if you want to put them on there :-/ you can have just a search engine on the branded page but you'd make more money off of putting ads on pages too
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:49:13] <word>	you only get money if people click them though and you can't legally ask people to click them >.>
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:49:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk, that would have to be a team approval type of thing
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:49:38] <word>	just like you only get money if people search, but that's a lot easier to get people to use
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:49:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	so let us know at the next meeting what's involved
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:49:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:49:52] <word>	ok :)
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:49:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	i got the idea now
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:49:55] <johnc4510-laptop>	thx
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:50:00] <word>	np
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:50:17] <paul928>	the ads would not be necessary, but a ss # or tax exempt # is necessary for Google
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:50:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, anything else?
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:50:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:50:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	that's a problem
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:50:29] <kennymc0>	yeah
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:50:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's very expensive to get one
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:50:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	and
[Sun May 25 2008] [21:50:49] <kennymc0>	xhans asked me to announce a security class that they are having at mcc

[Sun May 25 2008] [22:11:28] <word>	there are utilities to do a sitemap, or you can have google cache your site by submitting an online 5seconds to fill out form, and then you can have the search box search your site as well with an option button
[Sun May 25 2008] [22:11:31] <tyche>	I know that some of the search engines did, years ago.  But the company I worked for didn't have their own servers, so we couldn't do it.
[Sun May 25 2008] [22:11:42] <word>	basically all it does is have the search query followed by site:yoursite.com
[Sun May 25 2008] [22:12:17] <tyche>	Yep, but it's their algorithm.
[Sun May 25 2008] [22:12:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, i'm outta here, it's been a working weekend and i'm shot
