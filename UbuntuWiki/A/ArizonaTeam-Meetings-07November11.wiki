[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:45:09] <tyche>	It was bad enough working for a precast concrete manufacturer, and having to blow the concrete dust out of the computers once a year.

[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:46:24] <enigmastrat>	yeah.  Why eat paint chips when you can eat computer chips?
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:46:32] <tyche>	It was so bad working for that precaster, that the sysadmin installed a new operating system.  see http://www.geocities.com/rcwoolley/
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:46:39] <johnc4510>	and you know that it's been going on for yrs

[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:47:56] <johnc4510>	i just can't imagine it
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:48:02] <johnc4510>	right
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:48:09] <tyche>	Bad news.  Sent kids to the hospital
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:48:29] <johnc4510>	kids were putting the beads in their mouths
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:48:37] <johnc4510>	like any sane kid would

[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:48:44] <johnc4510>	sure
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:48:52] <enigmastrat>	it makes you wonder with stuff like that, if they are just trying to cut costs or if there is malicious intent
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:49:15] <johnc4510>	probably a 50/50 deal
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:49:28] <johnc4510>	know one will ever know
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:49:28] <tyche>	Once or twice, it's cutting costs and mistake.  This many times, over this number of products is criminal
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:49:37] <johnc4510>	yep
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:50:26] <word>	why can't they do something like they did with Tom Clancy's Debt of Honor :(
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:50:26] <tyche>	BTW, isn't McDonalds in China?
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:50:44] <johnc4510>	yep

[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:51:02] <johnc4510>	word: that was a good book
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:51:08] <tyche>	If so, then they may be retaliating for us serving them instant cholesterol
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:51:23] <enigmastrat>	but it's so tasty!
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:51:35] <tyche>	word: Yea,  That was a very good book.

[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:53:31] <johnc4510>	Theou: ah
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:53:53] <johnc4510>	i thought they had different menus
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:54:14] <Theou>	Didn't last time I was there, but that was a few years back.
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:54:25] <johnc4510>	Theou: bet there were a few people there on the streets walking around
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:54:35] <johnc4510>	lol

[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:55:32] <Theou>	Mao dedicated his life to keeping the West out of China.  There is (or at least was) a KFC within site of his tomb.

[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:57:05] <word>	way to ruin it >.>
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:57:12] <tyche>	word: I never found his books to be that boring.  He does have places where he has to fill out characters or plots/subplots, though.
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:57:28] <johnc4510>	nah, he does that in all the clancey books
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:57:32] <word>	yah the setup for the good stuff ;p
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:57:52] <word>	johnc4510: aahh i forget which book it was, but the one where they introduced him was probably the best one I've read yet
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:58:19] <tyche>	Part of the reason is that his books have so much action in them that he has to take time out to let you know what the story is.
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:58:19] <johnc4510>	i've enjoyed all the clancey books i've read
[Sun Nov 11 2007] [21:58:29] <johnc4510>	true
