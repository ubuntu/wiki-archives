21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> .

21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> a team blog
21:13 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:13 < kennymc0> ROFL
21:14 < johnc4510-laptop> i plan to integrate the blog with the loco team planet

21:19 < scott_ev> we don't even know where we ended up
21:19 < johnc4510-laptop> and then move one block east on highland
21:19 < sloggerkhan> and moved 2nd floor of tech services?
21:19 < johnc4510-laptop> there was a conference room there
21:19 < scott_ev> 3rd floor
21:20 < kennymc0> we ended up across the stree with a view out to some nice scenery
21:20 < johnc4510-laptop> yeah i think so
21:20 < johnc4510-laptop> 3rd floor yes
21:20 < kennymc0> stree = street
21:20 < kennymc0> but we saw the best scenery when going out for lunch

21:20 < johnc4510-laptop> babes in bikinis
21:20 < kennymc0> whoever invented bikini's was a god
21:20 < sloggerkhan> Hmm. One of those pics looks like a room where I have meetings all the time, that's all.
21:20 < johnc4510-laptop> on soroity row
21:21 < johnc4510-laptop> i had to lock the car doors to keep kennymc0 in the vehicle
21:21 < johnc4510-laptop> rofl
21:21 < scott_ev> hehe
21:21 < tyche> I believe it.
21:21 < kennymc0> what do you mean i almost had to grab the steering wheel to keep you from running over them
21:21 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:21 < kennymc0> and offering them some curly fries
21:21 < kennymc0> ROFL
21:22 < slofgren> it would have been more fun to watch kennymc0 talk to one
21:22 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, any changes you folks would like to see on the site
21:22 < johnc4510-laptop> additions
21:22 < johnc4510-laptop> etc
21:22 < kennymc0> CALENDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
21:22 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: lol
21:22 < tyche> It's hard to talk when you're drooling
21:22 < johnc4510-laptop> yes yes kennymc0
21:22 < tyche> I can see I'll have to go next time to keep these people in line
21:22 < slofgren> he would run up to them staring at their feet rambling on about how cool linux is
21:23 < tyche> Hee hee
21:23 < scott_ev> chix dig linux
21:23 < kennymc0> maybe you would look at their feet slofgren
21:23 < kennymc0> :P
21:23 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:23 < slofgren> ROFL
21:23 < johnc4510-laptop> ok
21:23 < slofgren> ah...I can't breath
21:23 < scott_ev> I'd want to know their eye color
21:23 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: we have some server question for you
21:23 < tyche> You look that high?
21:23 < slofgren> ok
21:24 < slofgren> ty
21:24 < slofgren> tyche: lol
21:24 < slofgren> haha
21:24 < johnc4510-laptop> http://www.fabianrodriguez.com/blog/2009/02/13/drupal-5x-and-6x-loco-suite-released/
21:24 < johnc4510-laptop> that link has a new loco team suite for drupal
21:24 < johnc4510-laptop> in it are some folders for openid
21:24 < slofgren> k
21:24 < kennymc0> oh johnc4510-laptop i saw int eh modules page a thing for openid in there
21:24 < johnc4510-laptop> kennymc0: oh
21:25 < tyche> Yes, but does it direct to the Launchpad OpenID?
21:25 < tyche> That's the one we need
21:25 < kennymc0> i will check now
21:25  * slofgren is confused
21:25 < johnc4510-laptop> the ones in that suite link to launchpad openid so that we would be linked to our team page
21:25 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche: right
21:25 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: ok
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> right now we have to approve registrations to the site
21:26 < slofgren> yes
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> and we are going to do that by following the team in launchpad for members
21:26 < johnc4510-laptop> only members on our team launchpad page are able to be registered on the website
21:26 < kennymc0> different type of open id
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> now, this new suite they put out had modules for openid in launchpad
21:27 < slofgren> ok
21:27 < johnc4510-laptop> if we can use those in our config we can stop having to approve members
21:28 < johnc4510-laptop> they would automatically be approve if they are on the team launchpad page
21:28 < johnc4510-laptop> did you follow that?
21:28 < scott_ev> I did
21:28 < kennymc0> only thing is that would let anyone that has an account on launchpad to log in
21:28 < kennymc0> wouldnt be restricted to our team
21:28 < kennymc0> just fyi
21:28 < slofgren> yeah
21:28 < johnc4510-laptop> kennymc0: that might be true
21:29 < scott_ev> OpenID + open access
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> ok, then we need to stick with our first thoughts then
21:29 < scott_ev> =
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:29 < slofgren> is it that big a deal to approve people
21:29 < kennymc0> not really
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> that's why i have you folks around
21:29 < slofgren> how many members are you expecting
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> to keep me on the straight and narrow
21:29 < kennymc0> boatloads
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:29 < kennymc0> lol
21:29 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: not sure
21:29 < slofgren> we will have like 10 members
21:29 < slofgren> maybe
21:29 < slofgren> and 3 will be active
21:29 < kennymc0> not enough to make it too much of a problem
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> we have like 150 members in launchpad but not that many will register i'm sure
21:30 < slofgren> I think we are going to big to start off
21:30 < slofgren> lets wait until it is an issue
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:30 < kennymc0> dont want to jam something in there that we dont really need
21:30 < slofgren> I am not saying I won't help though
21:30 < slofgren> if that is what you want
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: sure
21:30 < johnc4510-laptop> ok next on the server front
21:31 < slofgren> the more modules we had the biger security risk we will be
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> need the mail server set up
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> true
21:31 < slofgren> ok
21:31 < scott_ev> what arfe you goint to use for mail?
21:31 < johnc4510-laptop> because after we approve new members to the site drupal wants to send email confirmations
21:31 < slofgren> lets run past some config ideas on xHans
21:32 < slofgren> I want to know what is workign for plug
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> just like signing up for a mailing list
21:32 < slofgren> no reason to reinvent the wheel
21:32 < slofgren> yeah
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:32 < kennymc0> but where's the fun in that
21:32 < kennymc0> lol
21:32 < kennymc0> j/k
21:32 < slofgren> I have some ideas but their site is work securely without trouble
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> ok next on server
21:32 < slofgren> k
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> cron
21:32 < slofgren> k
21:32 < johnc4510-laptop> how often does it run?
21:33 < slofgren> how ofter you schedule a job
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> i think maybe it's tied into drupal and it's cron jobs
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> not sure though
21:33 < slofgren> I recommned setup jobs in crontab
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> k, you'll have to help me with that
21:33 < slofgren> what do you need it to do
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> since i have no idea
21:33 < slofgren> k
21:33 < kennymc0> for the search to work the site needs to be indexed with cron
21:33 < lenards> crontab -l
21:33 < lenards> =)
21:33 < slofgren> ok
21:33 < johnc4510-laptop> lenards: hey
21:34 < lenards> hola
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: what kennymc0 said
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> :)
21:34 < slofgren> hi lenards
21:34 < lenards> hi shane
21:34 < kennymc0> i did a manual index to get the search working to start off with
21:34 < slofgren> ok
21:34 < kennymc0> but as new content is added it wont stay up to date
21:34 < johnc4510-laptop> last on the server
21:34 < slofgren> kennymc0: share what you did manually
21:34 < slofgren> maybe after meeting
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> i am pretty sure we'll be ready to go live on the drupal site sometime this week
21:35 < slofgren> ok
21:35 < kennymc0> all i did was click on the manual index button in drupal
21:35 < slofgren> kennymc0: ok
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> i'll buy the domain name
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> but you'll need to set the address and
21:35 < slofgren> azloco.com
21:35 < johnc4510-laptop> yes
21:35 < slofgren> ?
21:35 < slofgren> aight
21:36 < kennymc0> here are the pictures i took from the server installs :) http://s263.photobucket.com/albums/ii134/kennymc0/New%20Serve$
21:36 < johnc4510-laptop> and we'll need to decide how we are going to handle the transfer to the main server
21:36 < slofgren> once you buy it we will have to point the address in godaddy
21:36 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:36 < slofgren> kennymc0: nice
21:37 -!- Thugal [n=jmcphee@ip68-99-137-73.ph.ph.cox.net] has joined #ubuntu-us-az
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> i am assuming we'll need to install drupal on the main server and then copy all the config, modules,etc
21:37 < slofgren> will the drupla stuff link of the existing site?
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> Thugal: hey
21:37 < Thugal> hiya
21:37 < slofgren> or are we dumping the current site
21:37 < kennymc0> i believe we are dumping the current site and replacing it with the new site we are building
21:37 < johnc4510-laptop> all we have to do is go in and change the site addy in drupal
21:38 < kennymc0> at least that's what i understand from all this
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> once it's on the main server
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> maybe between us we answered that question kennymc0
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> lol
21:38 < slofgren> ok
21:38 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: don't we want the drupal and the site on the main server?
21:39 < slofgren> but we will put the drupal stuff in www/ and not in www/drupal
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> ah
21:39 < slofgren> johnc4510-laptop: we really don't need the existing site
21:39 < johnc4510-laptop> agreed
21:39 < slofgren> we can just make new pages in drupal
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> well, when we copy the configs etc over can't we put them in the right folders?
21:40 < slofgren> so when someone goes to azloco.com they see our site and it is all drupally
21:40 < slofgren> yeah
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> k
21:40 < johnc4510-laptop> we'll need your imput on that for sure

21:42 < johnc4510-laptop> with slofgren and i as server admins and also site admins
21:43 < tyche> Works for me.
21:43 < slofgren> <--- 12yrs old
21:43 < slofgren> cool
21:43 < tyche> I'll be the supervisor, and watch kennymc0 do the work.  LOL
21:43 < slofgren> nice
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> everyone that's a member and register on the site will have full ability to publish to the site
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> via
21:43 < tyche> I LOVE work.  I could sit around and watch it all day.
21:43 < johnc4510-laptop> blog, story, event etc
21:44 < scott_ev> http://failblog.org/2009/02/15/deli-fail/  kennymc0
21:44 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche: lol
21:44 < slofgren> cool
21:44 < slofgren> scott_ev: lol
21:44 < johnc4510-laptop> you can blog, add to the calendar, write a story, or news item etc
21:45 < slofgren> but not delete others content?
21:45 < johnc4510-laptop> blog items will show on a separate page and in the side column
21:45 < kennymc0> only tyche johnc4510-laptop slofgren and myself can do that
21:45 < johnc4510-laptop> regular users can't edit others content
21:45 < slofgren> and we will work on backing up the content too
21:45 < kennymc0> admin rights ftw
21:45 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: cool
21:46 < slofgren> we can run a cron job to keep things backed up
21:46 < johnc4510-laptop> also for front page stories, they will need to be approved by one of the admins
21:46 < slofgren> yeah
21:46 < johnc4510-laptop> but tyche kennymc0 and i will be handling the front page stuff
21:46 < Thugal> are we gonna be able to integrate with launchpad's logins, or will we need new accounts?
21:46 < slofgren> xHans: ping a ling ding
21:46 < johnc4510-laptop> mostly
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> Thugal: we are discussing that right now
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> and we're not sure
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> so far
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> it looks like if we add open id
21:47 < lenards> are launchpad logins open id?
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> it would allow anyone with a launchpad id to add content to our site
21:47 < tyche> Launchpad has an openid
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> and we're not very up on that
21:47 < johnc4510-laptop> lenards: yes
21:48 < slofgren> everyone get a chance to see our new servers?
21:48 < slofgren> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Server/serverpics
21:48 < johnc4510-laptop> so right now it looks like you'll have to register
21:48 < Thugal> openid-teams would let you restrict to certain launchpad teams
21:48 < johnc4510-laptop> Thugal: then that's a possiblity
21:48 < johnc4510-laptop> we're looking at it closely
21:48 < Thugal> https://help.launchpad.net/DrupalPlugins
21:48 < Thugal> cool :)
21:48 < lenards> nice!
21:49 < johnc4510-laptop> we only want az team members to be able to add content to our site
21:49 < lenards> thanks slofgren
21:49 < slofgren> lenards: np
21:49 < lenards> the pics from the install kennymc0 linked were cool too
21:49 < johnc4510-laptop> Thugal: did you see the test site we have up?
21:49 < slofgren> Thugal: nice link
21:49 < Thugal> not yet.  been very busy lately :(
21:49 < tyche> Thugal: Thanks.  That (those) were the links I was looking for.
21:49 < johnc4510-laptop> Thugal: http://12.159.65.82/drupal/
21:49 < slofgren> thexy
21:50 < johnc4510-laptop> make comments
21:50 < slofgren> thexy
21:50 < tyche> johnc4510-laptop: You could have put the motto in Ubuntu red.
21:50 < johnc4510-laptop> so far most people are pretty happy with what we as a group of admins have put together
21:51 < johnc4510-laptop> tyche: i didn't see how to change the color or font
21:51 < kennymc0> yes o magnificent one
21:51 < johnc4510-laptop> maybe i missed it
21:51 < johnc4510-laptop> kennymc0: lol
21:51 < tyche> Maybe I'll look sometime.
21:51 < tyche> that would make it Kewl!
21:51 < johnc4510-laptop> as to our team log
21:51 < johnc4510-laptop> logo
21:51 < slofgren> might make is stand out more that the team name
21:51 < johnc4510-laptop> the space for the logo on that theme wouldn't let me use it
21:52 < johnc4510-laptop> so i went with a 3d ubuntu circle of friends logo
21:52 < johnc4510-laptop> i'm still looking at that
21:52 < slofgren> maybe we can put the logo at the bottom
21:52 < johnc4510-laptop> slofgren: good idea
21:52 < scott_ev> we need the az flag
21:52 < sloggerkhan> if you know block names writing a .css theme for a drupal site isnt too hard
21:52 < johnc4510-laptop> there is a place for a footer msg
21:53 < johnc4510-laptop> sloggerkhan: cool
