<toddc> TEMPE INSTALLFEST
<toddc> We will be moving several events around as part of changes in the server and regular installfest
<toddc> the next desktop installfest will be on the first Saturday of  the month from now on except may we will skip
<toddc> We will also be streaming all events on http://azlocobbb.banditti.com/  but until we get organized
<toddc> I will start as soon as possible after events start but due to setup time I hope to find others to run it  as we get bigger. This will let other's participate and be more active state/world wide but will take time to develop and and get the word out.
<toddc> The last several installfests have been very busy so we are also thinking about a room change in the future. The last several events were at or near standing room only.
<toddc> If you have time or want to meet any of us or have problems feel free to show up.
