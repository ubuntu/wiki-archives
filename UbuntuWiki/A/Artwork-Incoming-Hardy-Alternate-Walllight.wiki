== Description ==

A mock up of a possible desktop appearance, how the avant window manager can be integrated, a possible future skin/change to nautilus. I really tried to make this as aesthetically appealing as possible and I hope that it might influence the direction of the next ubuntu release.

=== Comments ===
* This is definitely one of the better dark themes, but I personally still feel such a dark theme should be avoided. -Sumit, 2008|01|30

* Looks great. I think this is one of the most professional looking skins I've seen. Thou I would not like to see such a dark theme in Ubuntu default - Maybe it could be included so users could choose??? This actually looks like something for Ubuntu Studio -MadsRH, 2008|02|22
