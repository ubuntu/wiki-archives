__TOC__

== Description ==

Designed to be a gentle theme with brown highlights. Someone on gnome-look was kind enough to suggest I submit it here.

== Concept ==

I chose the murrine engine because it is quite zippy. Also, it allows for a nice transparency, if installed from svn. The concept was to make a useable, good looking theme using a minimal of colors. A major inspiration for this theme, comes from '''''The Nightly News''''' by Jonathan Hickman. Hickman creates some ridiculously attractive coloring for this comic series.
