 04:17 <toddc> Spot Light

 04:17 <toddc> Billly Gates shares a report: It was this time last year that Microsoft announced that it was bringing Ubuntu to the Windows Store (now the Microsoft Store),

 04:18 <toddc> along with other Linux distributions. If you check out the app in the Store now though, you'll find that it only works on x64 devices,

 04:18 <toddc> meaning that you can't run it on any of the new Windows 10 on ARM PCs. That's all about to change though.

 04:18 <toddc> In a session at Microsoft's Build 2018 developer conference today called Windows 10 on ARM for Developers,

 04:18 <toddc> he company showed off Ubuntu running on an ARM PC, with the app coming from the Microsoft Store. It will finally suppotrt ARM64 PCs, although x86 devices are still out of luck.

 04:19 <toddc> UP COMING EVENTS is brought to us by MajB tonight!
