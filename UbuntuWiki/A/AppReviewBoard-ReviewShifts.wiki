__TOC__

The App Review Board members take turns tending the queue of submissions each Friday, UTC time. Each reviewer takes a 4 hour shift, but since they are in different time-zones, it's not the same 4-hour block each week. The reviewer will also be available on IRC at #ubuntu-app-devel, for submitters to ask questions.
