[21:21]	toddc	that is all I have any questions or comments or other news or ideas?
[21:22]	xHans	we have topics for September's east side meeting, but I don't know exact details. I believe one is on using GNU/Linux to talk to your car's onboard computer and the other is on making mosaics
[21:22]	_ericcc	I have a quick comment
[21:22]	toddc	I forgot to mention we two new members this week
[21:22]	xHans	I think we actually have topics for a few months already set
[21:22]	toddc	_ericc your question?
[21:23]	toddc	or comment as the case may be
[21:23]	_ericcc	just a comment.
[21:23]	spinrage	I have a quick comment as well. I used my raspberry pi with raspbian & xchat to join the meeting tonight.
[21:24]	corburn	Cool spinrage
[21:24]	toddc	spinrage: cool I have been wanting to try but scared to drop in the middle of a meeting
[21:24]	toddc	_ericc go ahead with your comment
[21:25]	Jabberwalker	spinrage that's awesome. I want to get my hands on one of those.
[21:25]	_ericcc	I think after the server is up and running and the site is all set. Would people be interested in trying to find a night and discuss some different things, how we can reach out, maybe some different "programs" like maybe a monthly " teaching session" Just actually sit down and talk about some ideas for the future, i guess?
[21:25]	_ericcc	sorry, little bit scattered
[21:26]	toddc	np that would be a great idea we could start it here and then create a event if it becomes too large or long
[21:26]	soldats	or an install fest
[21:26]	toddc	could work there also
[21:27]	_ericcc	okay. awesome, but lets wait till you guys clear up some time in your schedule, I know alot of work/time is being put into the server and such
[21:27]	|<--	_ericc has left freenode (Quit: AndroIRC - Android IRC Client ( http://www.androirc.com ))
[21:28]	toddc	the installfests are large enough that we do want to expand to another location but as of yet we do not have the volunteers to add one say on the west side
[21:28]	toddc	or Tucson
[21:28]	toddc	or Flaggstaff
[21:28]	toddc	or lake havasu----------
[21:29]	toddc	don't you hate when android IRC drops
[21:29]	_ericcc	Yeah, and that would be something we could actually figure out. I'd like to help out with one on the west side, but as of now, i'm only a little basic knowledge
[21:29]	_ericcc	(yes...)
[21:30]	toddc	np
[21:30]	toddc	Thanks xHans for keeping us up to date on Plug events
[21:30]	corburn	Does Encfs support keyfiles or passwords only?
[21:30]	toddc	any other comments or Ideas??
[21:30]	soldats	whats the deal withandroind dropping flash? whats the alternative and is it worth it phone wise?
[21:31]	toddc	adobe has said it will stop all deveopment on flash
[21:31]	soldats	only for phone
[21:31]	soldats	?
[21:31]	toddc	all flash is what I read several weeks ago
[21:31]	soldats	ive been AFK for quite a while
[21:31]	xHans	soldats: it's Google daring Apple to sue them for patent infringement on bogus patents
[21:31]	soldats	oh wow
[21:32]	toddc	it was due to html5
[21:32]	soldats	damn thats seems a little rediculous
[21:32]	soldats	seems so. html5 looks real good
[21:32]	toddc	don't worry flash will live on for years evil as it is
[21:32]	soldats	ha
[21:33]	soldats	xHans: HAHA good one!!
[21:33]	soldats	the iphone was SO 15 years ago
[21:34]	toddc	ok I will end the meeting but will be here for while if anyone needs help or has a question
[21:34]	soldats	with no phone though
[21:34]	rudgan	okay have a good evening and a great week all
