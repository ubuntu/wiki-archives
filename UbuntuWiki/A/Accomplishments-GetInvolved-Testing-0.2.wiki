== Ubuntu Accomplishments 0.2 Testing ==

Thankyou for agreeing to help out with testing our new Ubuntu Accomplishments 0.2 release. This page explains what to do and how to let us know if you have any problems.

You can get in touch with us in `#ubuntu-accomplishments` on Freenode IRC and on our mailing list at https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-accomplishments-contributors - you can also <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/questions/ask?tags=accomplishments|ask questions on Ask Ubuntu]]</nowiki>

'''Please Note''': You need to be running '''Ubuntu 12.04''' to participate in this testing.

=== Before You Begin ===

To participate in the testing you need to be running the `daily` PPA. To add this please run:

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-accomplishments-admins/daily
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install accomplishments-daemon accomplishments-viewer ubuntu-community-accomplishments accomplishments-lens accomplishments-battery
</pre>

If you were running the `releases` PPA, please remove that PPA and add the daily one. Your packages should upgrade.

If you have used Ubuntu Accomplishments before, either use a fresh Guest account or remove your existing accomplishments settings by running:

<pre>
rm -rf ~/.local/share/accomplishments
rm -rf ~/.config/accomplishments
