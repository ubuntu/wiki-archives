__TOC__

* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AustralianTeam/Meetings/|January Meeting]]</nowiki> - Regular Team Meeting held 11th January, chaired by <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JaredNorris|Jared Norris (head_victim)]]</nowiki> and attended by 10 team members.
* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AustralianTeam/LCA2011Brisbane|Team Meetup during LCA 2011 - Brisbane]]</nowiki> - Ubuntu-AU team tried to take advantage of having more people than usual in the one location and so some of us got together at the Pancake Manor to talk team ideas and generally socialise.
* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AustralianTeam/LCA2011Brisbane|LCA 2011 - Brisbane]]</nowiki> - Ubuntu-AU stand at the LCA2011 Open day. JaredNorris did a great job of organising us all, and Canonical support led to over 250 CDs and other freebies being distributed. We were able to speak to a large number of people about Ubuntu and the existence of the -AU team (over 500 team business cards distributed!).
