Next meeting: Sunday July 08, 2007  9:00PM  
Server: Freenode: IRC Channel #ubuntu-arizona

Greetings to all members on this 4th of July week. I'm sure a lot of you
are on vacation this week and I hope you all are having a great one. One
person who just got back to Tucson was Ian McEwen. Most of you will know
that Ian has been in Germany for the past month. I know everyone will
wish to welcome him back, and hear all about his adventures. Welcome
back Ian!

I should also take a moment to welcome Todd Bailey aka banditti to the
loco. Todd was the person who actually set our loco up as far as the IRC
Channel, the forums page and the launchpad page are concerned. We
appreciate the work he did to get us started, and are very pleased to
have him now participating in the loco. Please introduce yourself the
next time you see his name in the channel and make him feel welcome.

We have now edited our launchpad team page to fall more in line with our
wiki pages. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-us-arizona/|Launchpad Arizona Team]]</nowiki>    I should let
you all know that the team logo could not be used because launchpad is
very specific about the image size you can use, and when I made our team
logo to the sizes, it look, well, it look terrible. So I improvised and
used a Ubuntu Circle of Friends 3d logo that I had, and I think it is
passable. If anyone has a better idea, please let me know.

On Tuesday the 26th of June, I appeared before the Ubuntu Community
Council for Ubuntu Membership. I had great support for the team and from
several of the volunteer loco team mentors and also from the Kentucky
Loco. Needless to say, with that kind of support, it went very well. You
can read the log of the interview here:
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Johnc4510|Johnc4510]]</nowiki>  My thanks to all who attended and
voiced their support for my membership. I encourage all to think about
going for this perk of the Ubuntu System. You can always become an
Ubuntero to start with. Here is the link to the membership page that
explains both: <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/processes/newmember/|Ubuntu Membership]]</nowiki>

Summary of Last Meeting
July 1, 2007

Introductions were made, and no new people were introduced. However a couple old people have returned. Ian from Germany and banditti who was the person that setup our IRC channel. Welcome back gentlemen!

A new person was appointed the task of creating the teams newsletter, that would be me (Jacob2440). I will have the newsletter out on Wednesday's and if anyone wants to see a different look or different information please feel free to email me at pman2440@gmail.com and I will talk with John4510 and we will see what we can do. Thank you for allowing me to give this a try and I hope I do a good job for you all.

DX00 is still working hard on the server, as there have been many bumps in the road. However a CD-ROM was ordered that will be compatible with the server we currently have, and it should be up and running in no time. Along the lines of the new server for the our Arizona Loco team, a domain name was decided, with a 4-0 vote, by John4510, Sloggerkhan, bluecat9 and jsonder to use azloco.org.

SloggerKhan came up with some amazing designs for a CD/DVD cover that we can put use when we distribute Ubuntu to people. The links to the pictures are below. Members of the AZ Loco team need to comment on the Forum Thread regarding what design they like and there will be a vote on the July 8th meeting. It was loosely decided that we are going to have to go with both CD's and DVD's as some people don't have a DVD-ROM drive.

BR24 discussed what his thoughts and changes are to the EDU team. He thought best that there were many different documents and tutorials that are related to Ubuntu, it would be best to only post the ones that are used most commonly, that way not to overwhelm people. Along with simplifying the Documents, br24 also started a beginner FAQ page. Also if anyone is interested in helping br24 with his EDU page, please contact him via email at bribri124@gmail.com or through the IRC chat.

The leadership for Comps4Kids has been appointed to bluecat9 from sloggerkhan. Bluecat9 will continue with the original plan that was outlined, and will keep the ball rolling with local schools.

An idea was placed on the table by bluecat9 for the team to start up a paypal account where members are able to donate money and other funds will be placed into that account.

The agenda for the next meeting is posted here: <nowiki>[[ArizonaTeam/Meetings/07July08| July 8, 2007]]</nowiki>

Another great week of work!! Thanks to all!!
