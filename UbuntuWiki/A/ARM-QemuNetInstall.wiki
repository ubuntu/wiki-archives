Install qemu from universe:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install qemu
</pre>

Get the vmlinuz and initrd files from: 

<pre>
http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/dists/jaunty/main/installer-armel/current/images/versatile/netboot/
</pre>

Create a qemu image with the following command (indeed you can vary the size, the following assumes a normal ubuntu desktop install):

<pre>
qemu-img create armel.img 4G
</pre>

Now start qemu, it should drop you directly into the installer:

<pre>
qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 256 -kernel vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-versatile -initrd initrd.gz -hda armel.img -append "mem=256M"
</pre>

Now just proceed by following the general ubuntu installer question and answer game ...

 /!\ If you are asked to select a kernel, select "none", qemu.system-arm is not capable to boot from a kernel inside the image, you will need to use the -kernel commandline option

If you are done with the install you can start your new system with the following command:

<pre>
qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 256 -kernel vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-versatile -hda armel.img -append "mem=256M root=/dev/sda1"
</pre>
