[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:29:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	 * CDs and holders are taken care of

[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:29:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:30:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	Case badges-we need to decide how we are going to handle giving those out. We can't give everyone one.
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:30:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's my opinion that we can selectively distribute our case badges
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:30:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:30:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	in other words we don't put them out in the open
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:30:57] <tyche>	Give them out only when you give out CD's?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:31:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	not even that necessarily
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:31:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:31:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	this is the problem
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:31:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	and we need some input
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:31:43] <lenards>	I'd say you give them out to someone with Ubuntu already installed?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:31:53] <tyche>	Corporate and school reps?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:31:54] <lenards>	would that reduce the number?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:32:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	lenards: it would
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:32:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	but we also want some new people to have one too
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:32:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	so, i think we have to feel people out
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:32:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:33:45] <azteech>	? how many do we have?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	probably about 300
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:12] <paul928>	I want one!
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	a guess
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	paul928: sure
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	in fact members get a couple
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:32] <xHans>	require them to win some game
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: not a bad idea
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:51] <tyche>	Hee hee Require them to know what the GPL is.
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	trivia game??
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:55] <lenards>	ya
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:34:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: lol
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:35:14] <lenards>	you've gotta have some good sabdfl trivia
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:35:32] <lenards>	there's plenty of lore and trivia around ubuntu, debian, and linux
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:35:40] <tyche>	And for Windows fan-boys, well . . . I've got a staple gun.  Hee hee
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:35:42] <xHans>	you don't want to make it too geeky as you want newbies to get some
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:35:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	sure
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:36:12] <azteech>	trivia game won't work, except for those who are already familiar with linux .... or ubuntu .... we want new blood ... and they won't be up on the lingo .....
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:36:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	and i think that might really create some excitement around the booth
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:36:25] <xHans>	well, I presume you do anyway, guess I should frame those comments correctly :)
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:36:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: agreed, but i have a feeling this first conf. will be mostly techies
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:36:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	i hope not but...
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:37:21] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: yeah, I presume it will be, but I want to put lots of effort into the non-tech as that's the audience we really need to reach
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:37:27] <azteech>	not going to get anywhere, unless we get word out, via flyers ... the geek show .... etc .....
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:37:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: agreed
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:38:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: right
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:38:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so we want a game of some kind    right?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:39:05] <c0n3>	will we have the flyers at the thurs meeting hans?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:39:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: ? lenards ? kennymc0 ? paul928 ? azteech ?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:39:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	and c0n3
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:39:25] <azteech>	not so sure johnc4510 ...
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:39:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, any other idea?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:39:39] <tyche>	I haven't heard anything back on the fliers, since we put the information on the forum.
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:39:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	we need something to create a stir
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:39:50] <xHans>	c0n3: probably not
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:39:56] <paul928>	I'm still thinking of a appropriate game
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:40:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	paul928: ok
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:40:04] <azteech>	why not a drawing ... or something with tickets ...
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:40:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: we could do that too
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:40:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	nice idea
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:40:30] <xHans>	wheel spinning thingies tend to be popular for this type of thing
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:40:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	drawing once every hour?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:40:33] <paul928>	that's probably a better idea
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:40:39] <azteech>	xhans .. agreed ....
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:40:51] 	 * johnc4510-laptop considers a game involving spinning tyche

[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:41:07] <xHans>	the conf should probably do a prize bag every hour, Ubuntu stuff for that would be cool :)
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:41:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:41:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: kk
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:41:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	we can contribute to that
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:41:25] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: they make those wheels in human size
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:41:29] <Wolf_45>	Wouldn't that be "pin the tail on the......"  Nevermind.
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:41:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:41:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	Wolf_45: ooooh
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:42:05] <xHans>	or, just something like this: http://www.xkcd.com/152/
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:42:11] <tyche>	Wolf_45: It's a good thing you're in Tucson.  And even so, I'm thinking of looking you up.
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:42:17] <azteech>	lol, thought that was dagger toss, xHans ....
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:42:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok,well, i think we need a person to volunteer to work on the game, drawing, spinning wheel activities please
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:42:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	the room goes silent

[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:43:14] <Wolf_45>	It was just a thought, tyche.  Didn't say it was a good one!
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:43:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	this is only a planning type roll
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:43:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	coordinator
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:43:38] <azteech>	can't commit, just yet john, but you know reason ....

[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:44:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, how about a volunteer to start a thread on our team mailing list about this?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:44:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	that's easy enough
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:44:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	we can decide by committee
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:44:51] <Vincent_P>	I love rainbows.
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:44:55] <johnc4510-laptop>	Vincent_P: lol
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:45:05] <xHans>	it can always just be a card thing, where the contestant and someone from the booth pick cards from a deck, if the contestant gets the high card, they get the prize
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:45:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	that's an idea
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:45:30] <azteech>	yep, another good one ...
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:45:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	cards, spinning wheel and drawing ???
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:45:43] <xHans>	and dagger throwing
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:45:43] <tyche>	Pick one
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:45:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	that would be enough??
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:45:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:46:05] <lenards>	I vote for dagger throwing
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:46:07] <xHans>	yeah, just use one, but with the card thing it would be easy to setup
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:46:18] <Vincent_P>	Pin the beak on the penguin?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:46:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	lets try two, because i want the hourly drawing and one game
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:46:30] <Vincent_P>	Pin the glasses on the gate?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:46:34] <xHans>	use uno cards and if they get a 'draw two' they get extra chances :)
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:46:36] <azteech>	well, can always put in one card, in a deck, and have it say ubuntu ... and who pulls it out, gets the prize ...
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:46:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk, that makes it easier then
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:47:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	that won't be hard to get together
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:47:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:47:28] <azteech>	or, replace all the aces, with cards that say ubuntu ....
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:47:42] <azteech>	and if you get a joker, you get extra pull ....
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:48:22] <Wolf_45>	Paste a picture of Billy-Boy on the joker?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:48:28] <xHans>	use a picture of tyche for the joker?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:48:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: i just read that the linux expo had a install booth there, you think we could get all the groups to help man something like that. or is it something we want to try
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:48:44] <tyche>	How did I know that was coming, xHans
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:48:49] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: I think that's beyond the scope for us this year
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:49:01] <azteech>	that is what I was asking you about earlier ... too, john ...
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:49:05] <xHans>	also, the PLUG monthly InstallFest is the following weekend :)

[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:51:25] <azteech>	anything other than linux ... gets towed ... lol
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:51:55] <azteech>	anyone seen what others in past have used for signs?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:52:12] <xHans>	well, NT'll be rebooting, but Vista won't let them attend because we'll be considered unauthorized content
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:52:34] 	 * johnc4510-laptop says ok all signage??

[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:55:12] <azteech>	will have my laptop with me ....
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:55:15] <xHans>	I'm certain they will not have tables
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:55:16] <azteech>	if I can make it
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:55:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: table would probably be easiest and cheapest
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:55:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: kk
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:55:40] <xHans>	I do not yet know what facilities we will have, but am certain we can come up with something for the orgs organizing the event

[Sun Aug 10 2008] [21:59:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe openoffice

[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:00:07] <azteech>	open office, gimp, maybe scribus ...
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:00:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	it wouldn't be hard i don't think
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:00:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: good
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:00:26] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: I definitely want a demo room and maybe a game room as well

[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:00:47] <azteech>	games may take more horse power than my old laptop .... lol
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:01:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:01:05] <xHans>	demoing at the booths would be great as well, but I want a room dedicates to showing off :)
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:01:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	cool
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:01:41] <tyche>	You might want a projector for that, then.
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:01:46] <xHans>	azteech: PLUG should have a presentation on using GNU/Linux as as game server next month and using it for playing the games the following month
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:01:57] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, we will have a flyer for the conference, but i'd like a flyer about our team, our resources and support to have at the booth to give out
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:02:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: great
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:02:18] <azteech>	what about if folks want us to install on machines they bring with them .... we need to be prepared for that eventuality as well ....
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:02:31] <Wolf_45>	Rhythmbox?  I know that sound is a biggie for me.......
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:02:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	azteech: yeah, we should have that ability
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:02:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	Wolf_45: kk
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:03:00] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: the flyer should also be used for promo about $town
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:03:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	$town??
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:03:14] <azteech>	well, not to take away from PLUG, xHans .... but this is a convention. Why can't it be done at two seperate times?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:03:24] <xHans>	azteech: I want to avoid that at the conference, no installs that day
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:03:49] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: whichever town someone happens to be in :)
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:04:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: ok, we can set up something that directs to the next installfest in phoenix
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:04:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:04:41] <xHans>	azteech: not sure what you're asking, do you mean host an InstallFest another time?
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:05:41] <azteech>	no, was saying we need to be prepared for eventuality that someone wants to have us help them with an install, then and there ....
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:06:40] <tyche>	azteech: We wouldn't have the space or resources to do that, I don't think.
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:06:43] <xHans>	azteech: ok. I think the answer should be no as we will have too many other things going on
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:07:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, last for me  is     we need member support at the conference, and i want the team to plan a time for a small get together
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:07:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	at the conference
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:07:29] <xHans>	azteech: it's a good idea, but having random people show up with random hardware will be too much of a mess
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:07:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, anything else, long meeting   sorry
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:07:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	hee hee
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:08:04] <azteech>	agreed, but, that is what folks would be faced with, regardless of at conference, or at home ...
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:08:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	but it pads my lines in the stats, right kennymc0
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:08:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Aug 10 2008] [22:08:25] <azteech>	but, will set aside, for further conversations ....
