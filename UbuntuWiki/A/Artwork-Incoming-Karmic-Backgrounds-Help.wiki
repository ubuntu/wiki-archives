=== Many Images to add? ===

Have a look at this <nowiki>[[Artwork-Documentation-Software-Wiki_Scripts#Thumbnailer|Thumbnailer]]</nowiki>.

Alternatively, you can use this very simple Bash script. It requires imagemagick (<nowiki>[[apt:--imagemagick|Install imagemagick]]</nowiki>). Open a terminal, <code>cd</code> to the directory with your images (and nothing else in it!) and enter:
<pre>
for a in *; do convert $a -resize 300 ${a%%.*}_s.jpg; done
</pre>

Then, to create wiki markup:
<pre>
mkdir small
mv *_s.* small/
for a in *; do echo "{{attachment:"${a%%.*}"_s.jpg}}<<BR>>"; echo "<nowiki>[[attachment:"$a"|Full Size]]</nowiki>"; echo ""; done
</pre>
Here, you first create a directory <code>small</code> to move the small versions out of the way. The filenames of the small version are generated by the script by stripping the extension from the filenames and adding <code>_s.jpg</code>. This way it can be done in a single loop.

''Better, more robust scripts or additional explanations are welcome!''
