=== Who I am ===
A FOSS enthusiast from India, I am obsessed with technology and currently pursuing an Engineering degree in Mechatronics. Also, I'm the current 'root' of the <nowiki>[[http://vu-lug.co.cc/|Vignan University Linux Users' Group (VU-LUG)]]</nowiki>. 

=== Find Me @ ===
Email: unmole.in@gmail.com <<BR>> 
Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~unmole-in <<BR>>
Ubuntu Forums Profile: http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=823782 <<BR>> 
Freenode IRC Nick: unmole <<BR>>

=== What I do ===

* Help spread the word about FOSS in general and Ubuntu in particular through direct contact with people as part of VU-LUG's Install-Fests. This usually involves swapping their virus-infested Windows installs with fresh Ubuntu installs and helping them get started with Ubuntu. 

* Try and support other users on the forums.

* Contribute to the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-manual|Ubuntu Manual Project]]</nowiki>.

* I was a member of the Ubuntu Hindi Translators Team, and tried my hand at translating software in Launchpad.

=== What I'd like to do ===
* Help patch Bug #1 
* Play a role in the fall of The Borg of Redmond
* See the Ubuntu Manual on the official CD 
* Take the active membership of VU-LUG into triple digits
* Ensure that <nowiki>[[http://catb.org/~esr/writings/world-domination/world-domination-201.html]]</nowiki> proceeds as planned.
