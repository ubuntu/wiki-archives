== Dark Ibex Wallpaper ==

Here's a little idea I had for Ibex's wallpaper. Not really much but it might give additional ideas for the others. 

=== Concept ===
Dark wallpaper to complement the proposed dark ibex theme.

=== Comments ===
* It's not much for now but I'll continue working on it and see what I can come up with.

* Thats pretty cool, I would change the shadow that the ibex has on the right though, it shouldn't be blurred to fit with the rest of the piece.  -/- Rugby471
