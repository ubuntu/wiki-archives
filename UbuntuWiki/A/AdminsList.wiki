=== Objective ===

The ''Admins List'' purpose is to facilitate the contact between admins of Ubuntu sites and Social Networks' spaces to foster cooperation between initiatives. If you have questions, projects, or suggestions regarding Ubuntu sites it's better to contact the Social Networks or Marketing Team instead of anybody directly.

If you have problems with the format, don't worry, just write your site and provide an active mail address and somebody will set it up later.
