=== Concept ===
Yin and Yang - Dark and Bright ... My idea is that many peoples loves dark- or bright-themes ... or they like to switch sometimes, depending the wallpaper they use. The Theme is adjusted to the Humanity-Icons and pointed to be a simple EyeCandy-theme. The used engine is murrine. -enjoy-
