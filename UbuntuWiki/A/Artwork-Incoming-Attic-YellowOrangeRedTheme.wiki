Another theme specification...

Nothing glossy. Well, maybe some little aqua gloss cannot hurt.

It's going to Use the colors of ubuntu logo. Orange and red. Some Orange-Yellow would look nice too.

It should be a bright, easy-on-eyes, exciting theme.

The current ubuntu theme is so depressing. And it is getting more and more depressing. I know ubuntu artwork is different from the rest, but i think the brown theme is not a good choice.

== Inspiration ==

My inspiration is mandriva linux one metisse artwork. It's bright, simple and exciting.

== Icons ==

Ubuntu icons are nice, there's no intention here to change them. Or maybe some minor changes.
