My day job is doing Software Defined Radio research (using GNU Radio). I report my findings <nowiki>[[http://sdrblog.wordpress.com|here]]</nowiki> so I don't forget them.

In the night, I try to triage Ubuntu bugs, and learn as much as possible in the process. I report my findings <nowiki>[[http://azitech.wordpress.com|here]]</nowiki>.

I was born and grew up in Thessaloniki, Greece, but now I live and work in northern Italy. My wonderful girlfriend (Chiara) tolerates me while I do all this :-)

==== Contributions to Ubuntu ====

* Mainly triaging bugs: <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/~azimout]]</nowiki>
* Creating/editing wiki pages, such as <nowiki>[[DebuggingEvince]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[UbuntuBugDay-Planning]]</nowiki>
* Advocating Ubuntu at work and to friends; have converted practically the entire lab at work to Ubuntu (as well as my girlfriend, and a couple of her friends, too :-)
* Keeping a <nowiki>[[http://azitech.wordpress.com|blog]]</nowiki> about stuff I learn (also because I have a terrible memory)
* Testing new releases in alpha and beta stages
