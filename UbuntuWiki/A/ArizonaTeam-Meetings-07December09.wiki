[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:02:14] <tyche>	Gotta record your mistakes, don't I?
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:02:17] <johnc4510_>	it's going to be short anyway
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:02:23] <Wolf_45>	Hiya kennymc0
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:02:35] <johnc4510_>	ok, meeting called to order
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:02:48] <paul928_>	why will the meeting be short?
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:03:03] <johnc4510_>	i don't see any new intros and i don't have any announcements tonight
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:03:19] <johnc4510_>	was under the weather this wk, and am behind
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:03:25] <johnc4510_>	:( sorry
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:03:28] <johnc4510_>	ok
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:03:41] <johnc4510_>	we talked some last wk about an install fest
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:03:58] <johnc4510_>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoRunningInstallfests
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:04:15] <johnc4510_>	i did some research at above link
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:04:34] <johnc4510_>	and i'm not sure we can pull it off by ourselves
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:04:35] <johnc4510_>	so
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:04:43] <SloggerKhan>	+1
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:05:01] <johnc4510_>	i'm thinking maybe we could get the lugs involved and co sponsor it maybe
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:05:02] <johnc4510_>	?
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:05:25] <johnc4510_>	that would kill two birds
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:05:34] <johnc4510_>	getting the lugs involved with us
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:05:53] <johnc4510_>	and of course the install fest to advocate for ubuntu
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:05:59] <johnc4510_>	so
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:05:59] <tyche>	They have the experience, and the contacts, and we could provide the helping hands.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:06:15] <tyche>	That way we could learn how to do things.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:06:19] <johnc4510_>	does that sound like a way to go??
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:06:25] <tyche>	+1
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:06:48] <johnc4510_>	anyone else??
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:06:58] <SloggerKhan>	fine with me
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:07:01] <johnc4510_>	k
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:07:06] <kennymc0>	sounds good to me
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:07:09] <johnc4510_>	k
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:07:11] <paul928_>	can we do 1 in Yuma?
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:07:27] <Wolf_45>	Hey, the more the merrier
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:07:39] <johnc4510_>	well then, let me put some feelers out to the lugs and see if there is an interest there
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:07:55] <johnc4510_>	i'm thinking sometime in feb or march
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:07:56] <johnc4510_>	so
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:08:08] <johnc4510_>	we would have plenty of time to plan
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:08:10] <johnc4510_>	i think
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:08:32] <johnc4510_>	and
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:08:57] <johnc4510_>	i'll also put out a feeler on the team mailing list and see what interest i can drum up there
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:09:00] <johnc4510_>	and ideas
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:09:03] <johnc4510_>	maybe
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:09:15] <johnc4510_>	if we kick this around on the mail list
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:09:24] <johnc4510_>	we can draw some more interest
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:09:29] <johnc4510_>	??
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:09:38] <tyche>	Sounds like a plan to me.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:09:43] <johnc4510_>	kk
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:09:54] <johnc4510_>	kk, so
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:10:14] <johnc4510_>	tyche and i could use some more help on the education team page
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:10:27] <johnc4510_>	we have the layout pretty much set up
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:10:30] <johnc4510_>	but
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:10:39] <johnc4510_>	we need filler material
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:11:00] <johnc4510_>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Education
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:11:24] <tyche>	Speaking of which, johnc4510_, You know I was looking for information on CLI commands.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:11:54] <johnc4510_>	down through the office link is pretty much done on a basic layout
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:11:59] <tyche>	I found some ready made, put out by Fosswire.com.  It's a PDF file with the most common commands and what they are for
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:12:02] <johnc4510_>	and the items are filled in
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:12:32] <tyche>	we might want to add a link to that.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:12:38] <johnc4510_>	tyche: ok, we need to convert that to a page we can link too
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:12:43] <johnc4510_>	i think
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:13:00] <tyche>	That's possible, since it's "Creative Commons" licensed.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:13:09] <tyche>	I'll see what I can do with it.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:13:11] <johnc4510_>	althought pdf is an easy thing to save to everyones box
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:13:33] <tyche>	And print out, for easy reference.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:13:39] <johnc4510_>	but i think it's just easier to bring up a link
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:13:49] <johnc4510_>	tyche how many pages to print?
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:14:19] <tyche>	As long as you have a functioning GUI and internet connection.  Sometimes you need these commands, and don't have a way to get them.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:14:26] <johnc4510_>	true
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:14:30] <johnc4510_>	kk
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:14:34] <tyche>	1 page  PDF.  Nicely done.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:14:50] <johnc4510_>	let's just link it then on the main ed team page
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:14:51] <johnc4510_>	:)
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:14:53] <johnc4510_>	now
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:14:55] <tyche>	Explainations are brief and to the point.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:15:00] <tyche>	kk
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:15:41] <johnc4510_>	the idea of these links on the ed team page is to give new people links to the apps found on a fresh install of ubuntu
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:15:51] <johnc4510_>	in the drop down menus
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:15:56] <johnc4510_>	so,
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:16:17] <johnc4510_>	starting with "Other" we need to fill in the content
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:16:38] <johnc4510_>	tyche and i can format it to the wiki page
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:17:02] <johnc4510_>	so that's np, but we do need a little help on this if possible
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:17:19] <tyche>	we need names of applications, Links for further information, and a brief description of what it is.  I stole. . .ur, uh borrowed a lot of definitions from Synaptic.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:18:08] <SloggerKhan>	Basically you want description of applications that people can understand?
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:18:18] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:18:29] <johnc4510_>	yep and links to the home page of that app
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:18:52] <tyche>	I don't have everything on my machine, so I don't really know what's useful, other than what I use.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:02] <SloggerKhan>	So something like:
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:02] <SloggerKhan>	Name: _________________
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:02] <SloggerKhan>	Description:______________________
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:02] <SloggerKhan>	Familiar Analogues:__________________________
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:02] <SloggerKhan>	Links:_________________________
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:08] <johnc4510_>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Education/Internet
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:12] <SloggerKhan>	wow, that didn't format like I thought.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:17] <tyche>	Nicely put, SloggerKhan
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:22] <johnc4510_>	you can see at that link how i've set it up
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:41] <johnc4510_>	SloggerKhan  yep, that's the idea
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:19:48] 	 * Wolf_45 tries to think of what he's added since installing.....
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:20:04] <johnc4510_>	then tyche and i can add it to the wiki in the correct postition
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:20:06] <Wolf_45>	Sheesh, I've slept since then!
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:20:13] <johnc4510_>	ah
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:20:14] <johnc4510_>	well
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:20:22] <johnc4510_>	if you put in your live cd
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:20:34] <johnc4510_>	it will show you what is on a fresh install
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:20:38] <johnc4510_>	:)
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:20:43] <SloggerKhan>	Yeah, I agree with your formatting, I'd just add a similar too column that lists familiar windows/mac alternatives and a column for a link to more info.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:21:21] <SloggerKhan>	Not sure if that's a good idea, but I can write up descriptions for scribus, inkscape, and gimp.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:21:26] <SloggerKhan>	and wings 3-D
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:21:26] <tyche>	The link for more info is the name of the program
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:21:28] <johnc4510_>	SloggerKhan eventually there will be another set of links below those with alternatives
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:21:43] <SloggerKhan>	oh, I see that now.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:22:01] <Wolf_45>	Actually, it's easy - gftp, xmms, gramps (genealogy program).  If that's what your talking about?
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:22:04] <johnc4510_>	SloggerKhan like a separate alternative to the installed apps
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:22:05] <tyche>	We were think more of categories than related apps.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:22:27] <tyche>	That way, we're not having to try to evaluate programs we don't have.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:22:30] <johnc4510_>	Wolf_45 sure those are some alternatives
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:22:39] <SloggerKhan>	sorry, I'm getting confused.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:23:03] <johnc4510_>	Wolf_45 i think tyche knows all about the gramps thing   HEE HEE
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:23:04] <tyche>	So, how can we help you get un-confused?  Hee hee
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:23:05] <johnc4510_>	lol
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:23:14] <tyche>	WATCHIT, johnc4510_
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:23:19] <tyche>	LOL
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:23:35] <SloggerKhan>	are including repo-only apps or not?
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:23:47] <SloggerKhan>	Or are we including only 1 app for each specific function?
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:23:48] <tyche>	I would say stick to the repos for this.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:24:04] <johnc4510_>	SloggerKhan  in the alternatives it could be non repo stuff
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:24:11] <SloggerKhan>	So it doesn't just have to be defaulyt install apps though.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:24:18] <SloggerKhan>	that's what I was confused about.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:24:19] <tyche>	SloggerKhan: I'd say start with the most useful apps
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:24:25] <SloggerKhan>	OKay.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:24:37] <johnc4510_>	SloggerKhan ok, the first section is the installed apps
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:24:38] <SloggerKhan>	Yeah, so I can write up the 'open creative suite apps' if you want.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:24:47] <tyche>	Please mark non-repo apps as such, though, so we can distinguish
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:24:52] <johnc4510_>	the second are the optional or alternative apps
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:25:02] <SloggerKhan>	I don't use non-repo apps that I'd recommend to anyone.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:25:03] <SloggerKhan>	lol
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:25:08] <johnc4510_>	lol
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:25:10] <SloggerKhan>	other than the latest version of deluge.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:25:12] <tyche>	KK.  Hee hee
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:25:12] <johnc4510_>	me either
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:25:23] <johnc4510_>	yep, i do use deluge
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:25:24] <johnc4510_>	:)
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:25:59] <johnc4510_>	and exaile from the apps home page to get the most up to date
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:26:00] <johnc4510_>	but
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:26:07] <SloggerKhan>	brb
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:26:08] <johnc4510_>	if we include the link
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:26:36] <johnc4510_>	it gives people a chance to choose the repo version or the most up to date version
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:27:19] <johnc4510_>	ok, so
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:27:28] <johnc4510_>	if you want to help out
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:27:49] <johnc4510_>	just fill in some info and email it to me or tyche
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:28:10] <johnc4510_>	i'm at    johnc4510-cox@ubuntu.com
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:28:24] <tyche>	And I'm at tyche@cox.net
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:28:26] <johnc4510_>	tyche can you give out your email please??
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:28:27] <johnc4510_>	ty
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:28:57] <johnc4510_>	then we can take what you've sent and add it right onto the wiki page as it comes in
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:29:04] <johnc4510_>	sound ok??
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:29:43] <johnc4510_>	kk
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:29:54] <johnc4510_>	well, next then
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:30:11] <johnc4510_>	for some of you, the server is probably new
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:30:17] <johnc4510_>	http://12.159.65.83/
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:31:19] <johnc4510_>	enigmastrat did most of the html to get the page set up
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:31:31] <johnc4510_>	and i worked on the initial content
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:31:49] <johnc4510_>	there are drop down links toward the top
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:32:04] <johnc4510_>	that link to ubuntu    our team    etc
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:32:18] <johnc4510_>	more content will be added as we go
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:32:19] <johnc4510_>	and
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:32:33] <johnc4510_>	any ideas on what to add is appreciated
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:33:22] <johnc4510_>	we tried to get the initial page with the basic info   but enough to give an idea of what we are about
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:33:38] <johnc4510_>	so
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:34:27] <johnc4510_>	any questions, or does anyone have any ideas they want to discuss   it doesn't have to be about what we have been talking about
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:34:45] <tyche>	One other thing I'd like to bring up.  I suggest you see the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue69.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:34:48] <johnc4510_>	general dicussion ok
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:34:55] <johnc4510_>	nice
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:34:56] <johnc4510_>	ty
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:34:56] <tyche>	In particular, there are 3 Ubuntu evaluation videos that show Ubuntu installation from the viewpoint of a new user.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:35:04] <tyche>	Aside from the fact that johnc4510_ worked his fingers to the bone reviewing them, they are very good videos.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:35:14] <johnc4510_>	yeah, those are good stuff
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:35:36] <johnc4510_>	we might even link those to the server page
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:35:37] <johnc4510_>	??
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:35:53] <tyche>	Now, there's an idea.
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:36:07] <johnc4510_>	kk
[Sun Dec 9 2007] [21:36:18] <johnc4510_>	well then if there's nothing else?
