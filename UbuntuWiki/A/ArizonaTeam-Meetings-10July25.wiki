[19:15:08] <scott_ev> K-Rich: you'll find us a great little group
[19:15:18] <scott_ev> nearly no one will ever say RTFM
[19:15:24] <scott_ev> or STFU

[19:15:32] <scott_ev> maybe
[19:15:33] <quietstorm> any plans to welcome in 10.10 whne it comes final
[19:15:34] <K-Rich> lol
[19:15:42] <doorman352> RTFM
[19:15:58] <scott_ev> quietstorm: yes, we decided to start planning a 10.10 release party
[19:16:03] <doorman352> Ready To Free Martians.....
[19:16:04] <Flakeparadigm> scott_ev only says that to teenagers Â:P
[19:16:10] <scott_ev> we'll start that planning next month
[19:16:23] <doorman352> or was it morons..... ohwell
[19:16:26] <quietstorm> coolies
[19:16:29] <scott_ev> same thing
[19:16:40] 	 * doorman352 resembles that
[19:16:59] <quietstorm> really tight foot messagers?
[19:17:02] <scott_ev> quietstorm: you and I will be working on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Membership
[19:17:12] <K-Rich> so it's cool if i stick around, maybe pick up a thig or 2 and offer advise if i can?
[19:17:29] <scott_ev> that leaves the weekly team newsletter that tyche used to do
[19:17:30] <quietstorm> the more the merrier
[19:17:44] <scott_ev> is there anyone willing to work with me on that one?
[19:17:46] <K-Rich> cool
[19:17:55] <quietstorm> is tyche gone for good?
[19:18:00] <scott_ev> yes
[19:18:07] <xHans> :)
[19:18:10] <scott_ev> resigned his membership and everythign
[19:18:10] <xHans> er, :(
[19:18:13] <xHans> bah
[19:18:15] <Flakeparadigm> the new letter would be fun but I lack time as school starts again
[19:18:28] <scott_ev> Flakeparadigm: understood
[19:18:33] 	 * doorman352 needs to take baby steps.......
[19:18:41] <scott_ev> jsut foing the meeting page is realy nice of you and good job
[19:18:57] <quietstorm> would the letter be posted to the wiki or is there a mailing list
[19:19:03] <scott_ev> doorman352: true, we'll tackle the education page first
[19:19:17] <scott_ev> there's a mailing list too
[19:19:26] 	 * doorman352 needs edumakating
[19:19:32] <br24> hehe
[19:19:47] <scott_ev> but posting things to our team wiki is the main way Ubuntu can know if we should be allowed to keep our team status
[19:19:50] <br24> well I could tell you a little bit about that page
[19:20:24] <scott_ev> br24: is there any chance you'll be making meetings regularily again now that it's at 7?
[19:20:27] <quietstorm> I only have one day of college a week, that would give me some time to handle extra
[19:20:28] <br24> since that was the one I was working on that long ago
[19:20:46] <br24> well I made this one just because I promised ya
[19:21:10] <br24> Ive really been out of this group in a long time
[19:21:12] <scott_ev> no pressure, I was just wondering
[19:21:29] <br24> its a better possiblity now
[19:21:46] <scott_ev> k, you're welcome any time, you know that
[19:22:02] <br24> so what would you like to know about the Education page?
[19:22:22] <scott_ev> uhh...well, I think it's pretty self-explanatory
[19:22:51] <doorman352> are there more How-Tos to get us newbies up to spped that could be posted?
[19:22:58] <scott_ev> There's another wiki thing that we need to discuss
[19:23:02] <scott_ev> doorman352: yes
[19:23:03] <br24> that was the original intention
[19:23:33] <doorman352> cool, seems to my best way of learning ATM
[19:23:35] <scott_ev> we'll be looking for and incorporating articles and tutorials into that wiki
[19:23:40] <quietstorm> sugestion?
[19:23:43] <scott_ev> yes
[19:24:28] <quietstorm> create a you tube account and product videos linked to the wiki to do some tasks
[19:24:41] <br24> scott_ev: the original idea I had was to put the more popular apps for each category and give a brief description
[19:24:56] <br24> I did have some screencasts for some of them
[19:25:11] <Flakeparadigm> i can make video tutorials easy/nicely
[19:25:13] <scott_ev> br24: we need to update that to include the pre-instaled apps
[19:25:23] <Flakeparadigm> I have one. somewhere...
[19:25:32] <scott_ev> flake then you and quietstorm and I can work on that this week
[19:25:34] <quietstorm> osometimes it's better to see the process than write it down
[19:25:42] <doorman352> I would certainly recant my struggle with Linux in the beginning and the tools and resources that helped me.... ( i was a MS clone for many years)
[19:25:44] <scott_ev> on the main page on the right, there's a grey section showing the next team meeting.  Will someone please volunteerr to keep that up to date?  You can update it right after the meeting each week.
[19:26:01] <scott_ev> ok, those are all good suggestions
[19:26:48] <scott_ev> anyone that doesn't already have a job? please...
[19:26:54] <scott_ev> it's not much
[19:26:59] <doorman352> I'll do it after training...
[19:27:03] <scott_ev> kk
[19:27:08] <scott_ev> good enough
[19:27:25] <doorman352> is there a wiki to update the wiki?
[19:27:30] <scott_ev> doorman352: quietstorm we may start with creating ubuntu wikis for each of you
[19:27:43] <doorman352> :)
[19:27:50] <scott_ev> that way you'll learn a little about how this kind of wiki works
[19:27:56] <quietstorm> heard that LOL
[19:28:00] <scott_ev> it's pretty simple once you get the hang of it
[19:28:32] <scott_ev> OK, for anyone that's here in the valley there's an installfest this coming Saturday
[19:29:02] <scott_ev> we do these in cooperation with PLUG at the Universityu of Advancing Technologies in Tempe
