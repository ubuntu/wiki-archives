Next meeting: Sunday August 05, 2007  9:00PM  
Server: Freenode: IRC Channel #ubuntu-arizona

Last Sunday was a slow meeting as there were not many people in attendance. However we had a guest visit the meeting, greg_g who was from another Loco team and wanted to see how we ran our meetings. Also, we had a new member, paul928, who makes our second member that lives in Yuma. Paul928 has been using Ubuntu for quite some time, every since Warty was released!

John received an email from Mathew Helmke on Sunday. Mathew is a Ubuntu Forums Administrator living in Morocco, but he is originally from Arizona and even though he is not living here now, he hopes to return one day. He would like to become an "Unofficial Member" of our team if you all agree. I know Mathew from the forums and he is a really good person. We had a vote with the members that were at the meeting and no one had a problem with Mathew becoming an 'official member'.

Our team has register for the "Software Freedom Day 07". Software Freedom Day is a grassroots effort to educate the public about the importance of software freedom. At future meetings we will discuss what our team can do to participate. Here is the link so that you can reed further about SFD: <nowiki>[[http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/|Software Freedom Day]]</nowiki>.

Ian has finalized our account at CafePress. Here is the link: <nowiki>[[http://www.cafepress.com/ubuntu_arizona/|Cafe Press]]</nowiki> Please note that the merchandise has not been marked up, but is at cost. Now we can advertise our team walking down the street or drinking a hot coffee. Thanks Ian for taking care of this for us!

The Tucson Members had a great meet up at our local Bookman's Store last night. I will go into what we discussed later in the Team Approval Portion of our agenda.

Last little announcement, I don't know how many of you look at the Digg.com site, but John passed me a link that was on Digg.com where it talked about Ubuntu Loco teams just going crazy with support. So be prepared to meet many new people in the upcoming weeks and say hi to the new, incoming people when you see them in the IRC room. John will be able to into much more detail at the August 5th meeting.

Summary of last meeting July 29, 2007

The first thing that was talked about was the newsletter team. As I have been a little late getting this out as getting ready for school seems to be harder than school itself. I would like to apologize for not getting the newsletter out on Wednesday's, but after this one I will have more free time to get it out on time. Also Ian suggested that there should be more content within the newsletter, and I would agree with him on that. We had a member step up and wants to help add more to the newsletter, thanks to Marty we should be able to add more articles and make this publication more interesting! Stand by for updates and new items that should be coming out in the next few newsletters.

We are still working hard to get Team Approval and all members that are either new or have yet to do so, please look at the following links for our Local Ubuntu Team. The first site <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline/|Team Approval Outline]]</nowiki> is where you can see the goals that our group needs to meet in order to get team approval from the national Ubuntu group. The second site <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Approval_Outline/Resources/|Team Approval Resources]]</nowiki> is where you will find all the different areas we need people to volunteer to help get the local team ready for approval. Any help big or small would be appreciated.

We are also working on getting CD's and informational flyers out to people to spread the word about Ubuntu, SloggerKhan is going to try and have a prototype of the flyer ready by next week for the whole team to look at, comment on and see if that is something we want to use. And we are still in need of people to help burn CD's.

Thank you all for your help and support and lets keep up the good work.
