 04:29 <toddc> #endmeeting

 04:29 <wmack> toddc - you mentioned routing issues for the new bbb server. Can you elaborate?

 04:31 <toddcnb> we had trouble finding port to get it out from the team server but I just vpm in and use it locally

 04:31 <toddcnb> finding ports

 04:32 <wmack> That shouldn't be a problem when you go to banditti, right?

 04:32 <toddcnb> correct no issues there

 04:32 <FernHans> toddc: couldn't find which port it's listening on?

 04:32 <toddcnb> should be the sane ports

 04:33 <toddcnb> I shifted port 80 to 8082 and 1935 and 1994 just did a port forward

 04:34 <toddcnb> I am running just enough servers here to start making it difficult
