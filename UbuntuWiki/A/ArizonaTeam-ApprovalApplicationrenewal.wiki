== Testimonials ==

Arizona Team go go go! These guys are always well prepared at their meetings, hardworking, and have helped me fix more problems than I would care to admit. I HIGHLY recommend them for approval status.

<nowiki>[[Posingaspopular]]</nowiki> - Eddie Martinez from the Chicago Ubuntu LoCo Team

I have been a member of the Arizona LoCo since 2/2009 and an Ubuntu member since 7/2010.  During this time I have seen this team go through many changes and, though it's numbers don't grow much, there is always a revolving core of leadership and membership.  I feel this is as it should be.  It means that many people come, learn, contribute, take on a function within the team, and in many cases move on as their life situation dictates.  When I first moved to AZ a few years ago it was the AZ LoCo that made my relocation go smoothly in a social sense.  Because of the help I received from those that were in leadership and/or active in the IRC channel I became interested not only in Ubuntu as an OS but as a community.  This local community did enough for me that when johnc4510 had to step down as team leader I was more than willing to step up and fill that role until I no longer could.  During this last year toddc has taken over for me as my life would no longer allow the time commitment needed.  I have seen so many people helped learn Ubuntu as an OS and as a community of like-minded helpful people.  It would be a very sad day indeed if this team were no longer here to help people all across Arizona and beyond.  I've seen returning visitors from across the States and across the globe helped and served because this team exists.  I mean how often is it that a barely capable budding computer geek desert rat in Arizona get an opportunity to help a new Ubuntu user in Tanzania with his system?  I have every faith in the wisdom of the Approval Council so I will not loose any sleep waiting for a verdict.

<nowiki>[[scott_ev]]</nowiki> - j.scott.gwin@ubuntu.com - long-winded servant of the Hottest LoCo on Earth: The Arizona Local Community Team

<nowiki>[[Dazed_75]]</nowiki> - Larry Thiel - I have been involved with the Arizona LoCo for several years but primarily due to my activities in the Phoenix Linux User Group (PLUG) and the Sunland Lunux User Group (SLUG).  I finally joined the Arizona LoCo in order to help out and to have the opportunity to travel to other parts of the state in support of all things Linux and FOSS.  My focus has been on Ubuntu since Hardy.  Although I have yet to really like Unity, I am running it on three machines to give it a fair chance.  I have recently built a PXE server to bring to our Installfests.  It is able to network boot virtually all flavors of Ubuntu and quite a few derivatives in Live mode for checkout and potential install.  As this is much faster than an optical disk install, I hope attendees will be encouraged to try out different flavors before making a choice.

<nowiki>[[spinrage]]</nowiki> - Jason Mann - The AZloco team delivers interesting news, gives me a place to come to each week to meet other people who enjoy ubuntu & linux. Toddc always seems to be on top of things during the meeting & they're an excellent place to drop in when you need some support from skilled linux users.

[13:42]	stuart	win
[13:42]	popey	stuart: yeah
[13:42]	popey	see #ubuntu-uk
[13:42]	toddc	it is a combined event wit attendence at 15+
[13:42]	czajkowski	toddc: why on the Kubuntu wiki and not on the main wiki, curious? All in Blue
[13:43]	toddc	our original application was in kbuntu
[13:43]	Dazed_75	so he copied and worked it there. Does it matter for this?
[13:43]	popey	no
[13:43]	czajkowski	nope
[13:43]	czajkowski	I was just curious
[13:44]	Dazed_75	I was too
[13:44]	huats	I like the testimonial idea
[13:44]	itnet7	me too
[13:44]	toddc	np since this is my first I used it as a template
[13:44]	scott_ev	Our install fests are handled two ways. we have installfests thast we do alone - one per release of ubuntu, and one a month that we do in conjunction with the Phoenix Linux users Group once a month
[13:44]	toddc	we laso have a monly server installfest also
[13:44]	Dazed_75	two/month with PLUG
[13:44]	scott_ev	oops
[13:45]	Dazed_75	I also do 2/year with SLUG and 2 others for retirement parks
[13:45]	czajkowski	I see ye've only started to use the LD in the last 2 months, http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-arizona/events/history
[13:45]	toddc	and several out of the local area Tucson
[13:45]	itnet7	Dazed_75: How many newcomers show up out of curiousity?
[13:46]	Dazed_75	itnet7: varies a lot from about 2 to 20
[13:46]	toddc	we are continuing to add events and are currently add one in prescoot az
[13:46]	scott_ev	Prescott
[13:46]	itnet7	Nice!
[13:47]	Dazed_75	Most installfests are a mix of installs, assists, and fixes or discussions. Depends on user needs
[13:48]	leogg	I like the fact that you collaborate with other LUGs in the area
[13:48]	bj0	and sometimes random projects
[13:48]	popey	I agree leogg
[13:48]	toddc	we do a lot of that it helps everyone
[13:49]	czajkowski	toddc: how do you share out thing getting done ?? like getting in this application and getting events organised?
[13:50]	popey	toddc: your irc meetings seem to mostly consist of news dumps. Do the team find that valuable?
[13:50]	toddc	we have a small group that is increasing slowly that gets the core things done
[13:50]	Dazed_75	Typically, we decide such things in the Sunday IRC or at installfest meetings
[13:50]	Yorokobi	popey, I find the news dumps valuable. fwiw
[13:50]	popey	it seems more like a newsletter than a meeting as such?
[13:50]	isz_id	as do I.
[13:50]	leogg	toddc, I don't see much activity on the forums or mailing lists... how do you communicate with each other on the team?
[13:51]	toddc	yes since most of our things are events
[13:51]	Dazed_75	We are considering fewer IRC meetings and trying for higher attendance bersus people reading the notes later
[13:51]	toddc	we use irc and our big blue button server for most communication
[13:51]	bj0	there is a lot more IRC communication than on the mailing list
[13:52]	Dazed_75	We are also considering how to do some face to face with everyone so distant
[13:52]	Dazed_75	The Valley is like 100 miles across
[13:52]	czajkowski	toddc: I ask as the team is currently unapproved, due to the team expring as no application was submitted
[13:52]	toddc	Former Team leaders said the it was handled or that they would guide us and did not followed thru
[13:52]	popey	That's unfortunate.
[13:53]	toddc	I took over 9 months ago
[13:53]	Dazed_75	Aye!
[13:53]	leogg	toddc, how many people do you have regularly on your IRC channel?
[13:53]	czajkowski	toddc: ok, but you really should have come to us, it's taken a long time
[13:53]	toddc	with a huge learning curve
[13:53]	scott_ev	it's been a real hinderance as we are somewhet flying blind here
[13:54]	toddc	I was more inthe the installfests but learning has been fun but slow
[13:54]	itnet7	Anytime you need some help or ideas you can ping anyone of us
[13:54]	Dazed_75	What kind of help could we get from the council? I don't think we know
[13:54]	toddc	thanks will keep that in mind
[13:54]	popey	absolutely, we're here to help
[13:54]	scott_ev	I'm somewhat to blame as i took over after johnc4510 and didn't immediatly find out what we needed to do to stay curent
[13:54]	popey	lets talk about what the loco council does offline perhaps?
[13:55]	itnet7	Sure
[13:55]	toddc	ok thanks
[13:55]	popey	czajkowski / itnet7 / huats / leogg do you have any other questions for the AZ team?
[13:55]	scott_ev	being the team's one Ubuntu member I should have known better
[13:55]	czajkowski	hmm no
[13:55]	Dazed_75	Is there a page that might describe what ways the council can help with ideas and such?
[13:55]	itnet7	toddc: I have joined your channel feel free to ping me anytime
[13:55]	popey	No worries scott_ev
