__TOC__

We need to decide on standard software we want to pull in by meta packages.

Meta-Package Names should include include something a new user might search for.  Someone not familiar with "ally" might look for something like "low vision" or "accessibility."  Our meta names and descriptiosn should make sure to include all of these possible queries.  

<code>a11y-visual</code> could pull in:
* <code>gnome-mag</code>
* <code>gnopernicus</code>
* <code>gnome-accessibility-themes</code>
* <code>xcursor-themes</code>
* <code>extra high contrast/large cursors</code>
* ...

<code>a11y-speech</code> could pull in:
* <code>gnopernicus</code>
* <code>orca</code>
* ...

<code>a11y-mobility</code> could pull in:
* <code>gok</code>
* <code>dasher</code>
* X-10 application
* ...

<code>a11y-all</code> could pull in:
* <code>gnome-mag</code>
* <code>gnome-accessibility-themes</code>
* <code>xcursor-themes</code>
* <code>extra high contrast/large cursors</code>
* <code>gnopernicus</code>
* ...

A bug report was filed containing a proposed debian control file for gnome-accessibility-foo meta packages: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-meta/+bug/40306/+index|bug 40306]]</nowiki>. Comments appreciated!

I'm not sure this is always a good idea. Some of these things are now installed by default through the desktop package, which is even better because you don't have to install it at all. It is also not necessarily the case that someone who wants GOK also wants dasher, say. I think better documentation (including web-based) and easier ways of finding and installing software generally would be better, combined with a good basic provision by default. -- HenrikOmma
