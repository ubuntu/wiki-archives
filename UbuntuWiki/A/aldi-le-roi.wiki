=== About Me ===

My name is `Ben Salah ` Alaeddine, aka aldi le roi. I am a Tunisian technology enthusiast, 
CLLFSM(Club des Logiciels Libres Faculté des Sciences de Monastir) Founder and Member.

The first time I have heard about the Tunisian community was in the opening day of CLLFSM my club and I started following the community online and IRL since then.

==== Personal Linux Experience ====

I have first tried GNU/Linux in 2009 at secondry school (ubuntu 9.04), than it has become my primary operating system in 2012

As my knowledge about GNU, FLOSS and Linux have grown, I have tested many Linux distributions such as arch, Trisquel , gNewSense and fedora<<BR>>
But currently, I am still loyal to Ubuntu as my main PC OS.

=== Contributions ===

Since I have joined Ubuntu-TN I had the chance to learn a lot from the community and especially about the community.
I first started helping the community in the UGJ 13.03 by organization,traduction and I am tring to give any kind of help as possible as I can to our community.

==== Events : Conferences, workshops, install parties and others ====

Most Ubuntu-TN events are listed on our <nowiki>[[TunisianTeam-Events|Events]]</nowiki> page. You can find events details, reports, photos and blog links on that page. Our <nowiki>[[TunisianTeam-TeamReports|monthly report]]</nowiki> may sometimes contain further details or information.

During these events I have worked with members of Ubuntu-TN community and sometimes with members of other FLOSS communities, organizations, universities and clubs. I am very thankful to everyone who contributed to these events in any way possible.
