== About Me ==

While I don't have a computer science background, I'm the kind of person who wants to understand how the thing we rely on in our lives work. I'm not a carpenter but knowing how to build things has certainly been very helpful in my life. It's that mindset that brought me to Linux and free software. I'm also the type of person who looks for ways to give back to the communities of which I'm a part. This led to me becoming active in triaging bugs and other tasks in Ubuntu in 2007. Eventually I became an Ubuntu Developer in 2009. I began maintaining packages directly in Debian in 2008, and in 2012 I finally took the leap and became a Debian Developer.

Most of my contributions to free software have been as a packager for Ubuntu and Debian, but I do delve into other aspects of development from time to time. I have written apps aimed at <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/typecatcher |the Ubuntu desktop]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/stackbrowser|Ubuntu Touch]]</nowiki>.

One main focus of my work in Ubuntu has been helping new contributors get started. I've done this as a member of the DeveloperAdvisoryTeam, by helping to push forward <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/index.html|the Ubuntu Packaging Guide]]</nowiki>, answering <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/packaging|packaging questions on AskUbuntu]]</nowiki>, helping to organize the (sadly now defunct) IRC-based packaging training sessions, and by spending time sponsoring uploads for others.
