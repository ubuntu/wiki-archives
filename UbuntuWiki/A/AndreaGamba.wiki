__TOC__

I have been using Linux since 1994. During the years I have tried Slackware, Red Hat, Suse, Mandrake, Debian. Debian, in the Ubuntu flavour, is my favorite choice today because it works well and it maintains the original spirit of a free community. The Ubuntu distribution is really good in rightly configuring the many small things that are relevant for the everyday desktop user.
