=== Warmth ===
Ubuntu's philosophy has been one of openness, and the team behind Ubuntu has worked hard to apply it. This has created a welcoming community, which has helped Ubuntu become one of the most popular Linux distro's around. Yet the popularity can grow faster still, if we emphasize the philosophy in multiple ways.

Currently, the main area where this philosophy is expressed is through the community, as I said before, as well as through the selection of software. However, this can also be done through the desktop itself. 

Essentially, the goal of this project is to apply Ubuntu's philosophy and goals to its artwork.

=== Concept ===
In order to do this, we must analyze Ubuntu's philosophy to create main ideas, see where the current theme doesn't meet them, and fix these areas. Finally, we can add polish to make the theme better.

==== Analyzing the Philosophy ====

1. ''Every computer user should have the freedom to download, run, copy, distribute, study, share, change and improve their software for any purpose, without paying licensing fees.''
2. ''Every computer user should be able to use their software in the language of their choice.''
3. ''Every computer user should be given every opportunity to use software, even if they work under a disability.''

This philosophy is rooted in being open and welcoming to all. This can be expressed in colors by having a warm palette, yet not too bright. Being easy to the eyes will help make it more welcoming, so we do not want a super bright theme.

==== Analyzing the Slogan ====

Ubuntu is ''Linux for Human Beings''. This means the colors should be symbolic of the human race. Therefore the an Beige based color scheme is perfect.

==== A Solution ====

Using the Murrine Engine, I have created a theme which aims to solve all of the problems with the current Human theme, apply the philosophy, and also add polish. It has been inspired by the Dust theme, and is based on the popular Murrine-Glow themes (GPL). Screenshots are below - the first one has been labeled with the features of this theme.

=== Download ===

Please go to my gnome-look page to download and/or look at the change log:
<nowiki>[[http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Warmth?content=106753|Warmth Theme]]</nowiki>

A metacity theme is now included in the theme. In the screenshots, I am using an emerald theme that can also be downloaded from the gnome look page. I have also included a version for Ubuntu Netbook Remix. It is included with the download at gnome-look.

=== Bugs ===

Please test this theme and report any bugs or problems it creates here. I will attempt to fix them.

* Are you aware of <nowiki>[[Artwork-Documentation-Briefing]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[Artwork-Documentation-Message]]</nowiki>? Discussion about these is best taken to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-art|mailing list]]</nowiki> -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:t-w-]]</nowiki>  * Still using this as my default theme in UNR (thank you again for thinking of us netbook users!). Just wondering if there was any ongoing development or upcoming changes or improvements in the works? Not implying that it's not still a wonderful theme as it is, but things seem to be pretty quiet regarding this  project since the 1.5 release early last month. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:blueyonder]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>
** I've updated it on gnome-look. Take a look at the link in the Download section. I'll update this page soon. Also, regarding upcoming development, I'm working on fixing the theme to work better with the updated window picker in 9.10.

- where can I download the icon set?
