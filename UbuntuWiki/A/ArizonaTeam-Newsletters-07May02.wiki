Thanks to everyones hard work, the Ubuntu-Arizona wiki pages are really taking shape. I invite all members to visit as often as possible to keep up with the rapid developments. By visiting the main wiki page here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam  you will be able to link to all the Ubuntu-Arizona wiki pages.

At this time I wish to acknowledge the President of the DeLug Group, David Huerta, and the President of the ASULUG, Zach who were in attendance at the meeting. You will be able to read more about their reason for attending below, under the Server Team notes. Thanks for attending guys, and we hope you will consider attending again.

Summary of Last Meeting
April 29th, 2007

1. Introductions were made by new attendees, 17 people in attendance, up from 10 the previous week. We hope this increase in attendance keeps up. (It seems that between the information on the Ubuntu Forums, our own Ubuntu-Arizona Team Wiki, and word of mouth, we  have  been able to capture the attention of at least a few people every week. I would encourage all members to always be on the look out for new members, especially when idling on the irc. It is the perfect place to be able to talk directly to these people and to show them what a great group we are).

2. The Membership Team, headed by IanMcewen let us know that they have so far been concentrating on getting the team organized. The team's wiki page is up and running and they are in the process of getting ideas together to help increase our membership. They hope to first launch something in the Phoenix area since we are drawing mostly Tucson people at this time.

3. The Web Development Team is helping to get the wiki pages up and running. With school being close to finals and family commitments, other members have had to pitch in to help complete some of the projects. This shows the commitment of all the Ubuntu-Arizona Team members in helping to accomplish our goals. Thanks to all.

4. The Wine/VMWare Team, which is a new team, seemed to draw a lot of conversation. This would seem to justify the creation of this team. Brian Richardson (br24) is heading this team, and I believe he is going to be a busy man considering all the feedback at the meeting. We will look forward to hearing more about what we can expect from this team down the road.

5. The Newsletter Team put out the 1st edition of news from our group on the 25th of April. It has been decided that Royal (rs3) will be the new editor, and he will be taking over these responsibilities as soon as school is out. Next weeks edition will still be put out by johnc, and then he will, most happily, turn his editorial duties over to Royal. :) :) johnc smiles!!

6. The proposed Computer Recycle Team also drew a good bit of conversation. Mostly, as to whether we would need to go through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or the Federal Government. It seemed that most of us liked the idea, we just weren't sure how we would go about implementing it. It was finally decided that Dustin (Slogger), who would be leading this team, would check out the options and get back to the group on which direction might be best.

7. The proposed Server Team, to be headed by Robert (DX00), seemed to have everyones endorsement. Through the generosity of the DeLug group out of Phoenix, it looks like we will have use of this equipment to help train our members in several IT administration levels. I hope we can also use this to branch off another team devoted to Web Page Development in the future. We look forward to Robert's next report on this exciting new team.

8. The proposed Thread Team met with mixed reviews, and it was decided that more research was needed before we could even bring it up for a vote. This was a minimal idea to begin with and we probably need to go in other directions first, but it is something we might keep in mind for the future. However, a clearer idea of what the teams goals and purpose is, would have to be defined better before we could even consider it.

9. Ubuntu-Arizona Team Official Logo was discussed, and it was decided that we would set up a thread on the Ubuntu-Arizona Forum. We will take submissions until the next meeting and then vote on the official logo. The thread for submissions is here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=428013  I have notice that as of today, no one has made any submissions. Please post your submission to this thread in order to have it considered in the upcoming vote on May 6th, 2007

10. The agenda for the May 6th meeting will be as follows:

 1. Introductions
 2. Team Reports
** a. Membership Team
** b. Web Development Team
** c. Newsletter Team
