[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:03:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	One of the perks for approved loco teams is bulk shipments of Ubuntu CDs. I send in our request for our allotment. I'm assuming it will take 4-6 weeks to receive them. Between now and then we need to discuss how best to utilize them.
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:03:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	the wiki says we get 400 assorted flavors of cds
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:03:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	:-)

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:04:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	there is a new program forming up on open source in libraries
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:04:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	i will consult that for ideas
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:04:50] <xHans>	are you interested in working with Kid Computers and maybe giving the CDs wtih the computers?
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:05:11] <xHans>	http://www.kidcomputers.org/

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:05:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	that sounds like a great idea

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:06:08] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: cool
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:06:12] <paul928>	xHans, do you know if that program is being implemented in Yuma?
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:06:27] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: yes, another community college instructor and the guys at Red Seven
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:06:58] <jsonder>	No kids computers drop off in Tucson!
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:06:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	nice, would they be receptive to us donating some cds?
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:07:04] <xHans>	paul928: it's Phoenix area only for now, but if you can find someone in Yuma to help organize it we can probably expand
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:07:18] <xHans>	jsonder: see what I just said to paul928 :)
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:07:40] <jsonder>	yayayaya
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:07:48] <xHans>	ENOSGTBLACK: Sierra Vista is out :)
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:08:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	I'll use the contact info there inquire if they would like us to help out with cds
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:08:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	so libraries, and kid computers then

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:10:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: we tried some tucson computer stores and they wanted nothing to do with open source :(
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:10:05] <xHans>	there's a place in Mesa that wants to start selling GNU/Linux boxen and is mostly sold on Kubuntu
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:10:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:10:14] <word>	kubuntu ftw

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:11:55] <johnc4510-laptop>	Another perk is an web address on the Ubuntu servers. We are still going to set up our own server, but this is an added way to gain web exposure for our team. In addition to the webpage we will be able to have out own planet syndicated.
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:12:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	.
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:12:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	.
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:12:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	That means that we can have a blog page that every member with a blog can publish to. I'll have detailed instructions for the next meeting on how it works. Members can use it for team announcements, tutorials, etc. Note: This would be a monitored planet and content would have to be acceptable!!
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:12:31] <xHans>	do Ubuntu or Canonical have a program for helping small computer retailers to start selling with Ubuntu pre-installed?
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:12:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: not that i know of

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:15:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: maybe, not sure, i know the ubuntu members blog on the planet takes from blog sites
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:15:41] <tyche>	Well, the Planet Ubuntu does.  And I think Ohio did it that way

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:19:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: i was hoping the California guy with google might smooth the way for us
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:19:33] <xHans>	there will likely be a few googlians at paintball Saturday

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:20:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: great
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:20:56] <xHans>	jsonder: it should be
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:21:22] <xHans>	one Red Hat person has expressed some support, waiting to hear back from the one in Flagstaff
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:21:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: i was thinking that once we get 4 or so of the lugs on line with the idea, we should have a irc meetup to hack out some plans??
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:22:00] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: sounds good to me
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:22:12] <jsonder>	I just followed links after a google search, my green machine is still current
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:22:18] <xHans>	and we already hit it as slofgren and I represent 4 groups ;-)
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:22:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: you have more experience with this stuff than me, do you have ideas on topics ??
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:22:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	and good speakers?
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:23:30] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: we're going through topic ideas for LOPSA to use with OLF and SCaLE, I can bring in that list
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:23:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	great
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:23:54] <tyche>	Richard Stallman or "Mad Dog" might be good.  But they'd be a bit hard to get on short notice (short=less than 6 months)
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:24:11] <xHans>	I can also bring in some speaker ideas, but I think we need to really get lots of locals involved, especially the first time out
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:24:29] <xHans>	do we have a source of funding to bring someone in?
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:24:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: agreed   this time around local talent
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:24:39] <kennymc0_laptop>	yeah if this turns into a anual thing we could make it bigger and better each year
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:24:56] <xHans>	kennymc0_laptop: that's my hope :)
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:25:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	xHans: not really, i was hoping this first one could be a free conference
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:25:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	free to come and free speakers
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:25:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	to encourage a good turnout
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:25:26] <xHans>	OK, funding would be for paying for some speakers to come in
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:25:28] <tyche>	We've definitely got to stay local, then
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:25:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	in the state
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:25:37] <xHans>	sponsors can pay that part
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:25:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	yeah, that's an idea
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:25:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	we could use any donated funds for outside speakers
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:26:00] <xHans>	we might be able to get one of my suggested speakers since you're now an official team :)
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:26:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe the keynote at least
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:26:11] <paul928>	Any suggestions for sponsors?

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:28:49] <xHans>	we need to know location before we can plan for booths
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:29:04] <xHans>	AuitoZone is CMK Automotive?
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:29:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	well, i'm pretty sure it will be ASU
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:29:28] <xHans>	we need to know if booths would be allowed and how much they'd cost and how many we'd have room for
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:30:09] <paul928>	xHans, not sure if the're CMK or not.
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:30:20] <xHans>	well, we could likely get interest from UAT, community colleges, a few high schools and maybe a business or two
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:30:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	k on checking if allowed, shouldn't they set up their own at their cost, or are you suggesting charging for booth space
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:30:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:30:40] <xHans>	paul928: OK, well I know one of the sysadms over at CMK :)
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:30:57] <paul928>	xHans, great
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:31:10] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: depending on where we go,  the facility might have requirements on booths, especially booths for pay
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:31:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:31:38] <xHans>	the civic center requires $50 per booth to hook up electricity or something like that
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:31:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	when the pres. of ASU gets back off vacation i'll find those things out
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:31:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:32:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'm hoping the university won't want that
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:32:10] <xHans>	johnc4510-laptop: you're talking directly to ASU's prez?
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:32:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	but we'll find out
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:32:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	the pres of the lug
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:32:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think he is a professor there
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:32:43] <xHans>	ah, ok, being a prof can help
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:32:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	sure
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:32:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:33:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	:->
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:33:09] <xHans>	ASU's still a pain, but there are a few locations that can work out just fine
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:33:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	k, well, if we can get a central space like that for free, i think we should maybe use it for this first conference
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:34:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	being as how we're trying to make it free
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:34:09] <xHans>	ok
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:34:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	then maybe next yr we can expand it and make it a really big deal
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:34:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	i hope
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:34:52] <tyche>	UoP Stadium?

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:35:28] <xHans>	jsonder: down here is where?
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:35:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	i was also thinking if we could get some merchandise donations, we could run a games booth and use the money to donate to a charity of some kind
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:35:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	??
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:35:36] <jsonder>	Green Valley

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:38:03] <xHans>	we need to start thinking about where to advertise it
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:38:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:38:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:39:23] <tyche>	What do you mean by graphics, xHans
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:39:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	well, tyche is working on a flyer
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:39:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	sorry forgot that
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:39:45] <xHans>	ok, that, in my experience, is one of the hardest things for geeks to do and graphics are especially important for marketing
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:40:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:40:19] <tyche>	I've had some limited experience with a previous employer
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:40:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	so are you thinking a logo for the conference?

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:41:11] <tyche>	I wish.  But AutoCAD won't run under WINE
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:41:22] <tyche>	Otherwise, I could do it.
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:41:46] <xHans>	tyche: there are several Free Software CAD programs, but I think most are only for circuit boards
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:41:56] <jsonder>	I have windows boxen
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:42:00] <tyche>	That, or they're only 2d

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:42:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:43:04] 	 * xHans notes to talk to tyche about Blender sometime, but not during the mtg
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:43:14] <tyche>	Maybe they know something I don't know (likely).  Why don't we talk later.
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:43:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	well, we need some kind of logo emblem to build around??

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:45:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	education as in ??   for schools??
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:45:23] <xHans>	and then there are those people who throw really expensive electronics at other planets...

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:46:58] <tyche>	As I understand it, it's using a stripped down version of Linux
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:47:12] <xHans>	they're a bit busy right now, but things should calm down for them soonish
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:47:23] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe they'd like to talk about open source use in outerspace projects and give an update on what
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:47:30] <tyche>	I can't imagine why they should be busy.  Hee hee
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:47:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	s going on there on mars

[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:51:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	but
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:51:38] <xHans>	we could easily draw a couple hundred people, but only if we're successful in getting the word out
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:51:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	cool, i was hoping maybe 300
[Sun Jun 8 2008] [21:51:52] <xHans>	no advertising and we'll be lucky to get a dozen
