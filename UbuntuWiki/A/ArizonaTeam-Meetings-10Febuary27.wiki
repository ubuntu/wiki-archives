Feb 27 21:10:46 toddc ok I will make the changes any other changes or comments?
Feb 27 21:12:08 toddc at this time I have two members of ax loco that say they will be there and four from plug
Feb 27 21:13:02 * tagumcity has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Feb 27 21:13:02 LostPenguin definatly want to get the reservation nailed down this week so we can start full scale promoition
Feb 27 21:13:32 toddc I think if every one show we should be ok but we may pick up some students there to help and and added the rsvp so we can get a rough Idea

Feb 27 21:15:35 toddc xHans if you are here do you have any news for us?
Feb 27 21:15:52 toddc Anyone here new tonight please introduce yourself  and tell us a little about yourself?
Feb 27 21:16:09 yourwhiteshadow what about ubuntu based distros, that aren't "official"
Feb 27 21:16:33 toddc I lokked at the list and found a lot that they missed
Feb 27 21:16:42 toddc looked
Feb 27 21:17:13 soldats IMO bring any distro you have just in case
Feb 27 21:17:18 toddc I thought the custom guide was cool and did a few of them
Feb 27 21:18:23 toddc I have a server that has most major distro (iso) on it that we can write to usb drives as needed or burn cd's
Feb 27 21:18:44 yourwhiteshadow that sounds cool, i'll just bring a grip of usb drives
Feb 27 21:18:46 soldats thats awesome
Feb 27 21:18:49 toddc I also hace 20 fedora 14 disks
Feb 27 21:19:34 LostPenguin your server have PPC stuff?
Feb 27 21:20:25 toddc doing the monthly installfest we should have everything we need and also we will have the ubuntu banner and if I have time I plan to make some sandwich boards to direct people to your area
Feb 27 21:20:38 toddc PPC?
Feb 27 21:20:57 LostPenguin PowerPC processor, macs use them
Feb 27 21:21:10 LostPenguin instead of x86/x64
Feb 27 21:21:17 scott_ev sorry, +1
Feb 27 21:21:28 toddc I have a few and most of the 64bit distros
Feb 27 21:21:44 toddc np scott glad you made it
Feb 27 21:22:07 scott_ev toddc: I'll be skipping 10.10 since 11.04 isn't that far off
Feb 27 21:22:21 LostPenguin I know you probably have x86 and 64, but if you don;t have PPC I'll make a pont too copy y 10.10 ppc
Feb 27 21:22:31 toddc last time in tucson we did 1 mac install
Feb 27 21:22:34 scott_ev unless I can get 10.10 disks before installfest
Feb 27 21:23:03 toddc ok I ment 11.04  but misstyped
Feb 27 21:23:11 scott_ev kk
Feb 27 21:23:47 toddc I have 10.10 on usb three 1 unr 1 I386 1 64bit
Feb 27 21:24:19 toddc we should be fine also larry has most of them on cd already
Feb 27 21:25:01 toddc Eric is also planning on going down so we will have several experts for any problem pc's
Feb 27 21:25:59 toddc let me know when the roon is finalized so I can start printing and shipping flyers
Feb 27 21:26:15 toddc any other questions?
Feb 27 21:27:10 yourwhiteshadow let's plan for lunch?
Feb 27 21:27:19 yourwhiteshadow since we'll be there from 10-5 or w/e
Feb 27 21:28:05 LostPenguin Student union is close and has a lot of food. and plenty of places will deliver pizza
Feb 27 21:28:32 toddc at normal installfests I rarley ever have time for lunch but maybe we will get lucky--I do plan on a ice chest with water
Feb 27 21:28:56 toddc and may bring a few snacks just in case
Feb 27 21:29:54 toddc last time we went out to dinner after wards and that may be a better idea than leaving all the computers in the lobby
Feb 27 21:30:46 LostPenguin We're all prety intelegent people, I'm sure will figure out shiftes, send a runner, w/e
Feb 27 21:31:38 toddc np we can play it by ear and see what happens --I may have a better ides after we get some rsvp's back
Feb 27 21:32:49 scott_ev definitely bring drinks & food
Feb 27 21:33:08 scott_ev there won't be time to go out or send someone out for lunch
Feb 27 21:33:25 toddc if some one has time uofA had a ubuntu image that they recommended last time as a download we should get familier with it they may want it installed
Feb 27 21:33:31 bj0 was there an installfest yesturday
Feb 27 21:33:36 bj0 ?
Feb 27 21:33:37 toddc yes
Feb 27 21:33:50 bj0 wow i type really really slow when my hands are cold
Feb 27 21:34:54 toddc we helped 4-5 new users was a little slower than normal but they they we all problem pc's so I keep busy
Feb 27 21:35:51 yourwhiteshadow should we do classes or something for people who want to learn some stuff?
Feb 27 21:37:11 toddc based on normal installfests no they each come in with individual needs but I have thought about running a few into slide shows
Feb 27 21:37:57 * tagumcity has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Feb 27 21:38:29 * tagumcity (~tagumcity@wsip-68-14-225-33.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined #Ubuntu-US-AZ
Feb 27 21:38:49 toddc last time at UofA there several normal installs and a lot of questions like how to install SQL from students others were just normal installs
Feb 27 21:40:31 toddc keep in mind that they use ubuntu on most of the school servers and recommend students to use ubuntu so we will get a wide range of questions from sudent but some of them will have a lot of ubuntu knowalage also
Feb 27 21:41:33 toddc any other questions or comments?
Feb 27 21:41:56 tagumcity hi Todd, this Dwayne
Feb 27 21:42:30 toddc hello Dwanye how are you tonight
Feb 27 21:43:12 toddc thanks for coming tonight but I will be here a while
Feb 27 21:43:24 yourwhiteshadow maybe we can advertise it as a demo too, and do demos?
Feb 27 21:43:48 bj0 i have a question
Feb 27 21:43:55 bj0 http://www.pythonchallenge.com/
Feb 27 21:43:56 bj0 lvl 6
Feb 27 21:44:01 toddc you are more than welcome to if you have any ideas
Feb 27 21:44:01 bj0 :)
Feb 27 21:45:30 toddc and yes the install fest we answer a lot questions and wal around looking at what everyone is running /using they are always fun
Feb 27 21:45:41 toddc walk
Feb 27 21:46:24 toddc I wish I knew more about python that looks like fun
Feb 27 21:46:58 tagumcity Todd did that install finish up okay?
Feb 27 21:47:47 toddc I will be looking around this week for flyers I had some other cool ones in the past and will bring some training Q&A flyer's
Feb 27 21:48:11 bj0 it's almost more riddle than python knowledge
Feb 27 21:48:54 toddc I ended up with puppy linux and a remote usb wifi but have since found the problem and will try to get with him this weekend
Feb 27 21:49:08 toddc next weekend
Feb 27 21:50:42 toddc dell laptop need to change bios to SATA vs AHCI? then install linux but grub legacy did work fine
Feb 27 21:51:23 LostPenguin how much space does it take to make a cannnical mirror?
Feb 27 21:51:29 toddc but every time I went into windows 7 from grub2 it wiped out grub2 due to bios
Feb 27 21:52:09 tagumcity that was unusual or what?
Feb 27 21:52:46 toddc good question I saw a guide on it mirror but did not see the size needed I would need to look around
Feb 27 21:53:32 LostPenguin I can look for it if no one has it on had, might be something good to have for installfests if we can cojure up the space
Feb 27 21:53:42 toddc tagumcity seems to be common on several newer dell models that reported the same problem
Feb 27 21:54:51 yourwhiteshadow anyone wanna recommend an automated backup server software and a client side software?
Feb 27 21:54:59 toddc most of the installfest have very good bandwidth and you need to redirect the updates as I recall but yes if you have time let me know
Feb 27 21:56:01 toddc I use bacula and rsynce to my usb hard drive and soon to my servers
Feb 27 21:57:16 toddc some other often used docs I also use ubuntu one since it is free 2 gb and I can access it from anywhere or any computer
Feb 27 21:57:36 yourwhiteshadow i see, they have windows clients? bacula?
Feb 27 22:01:26 toddc well I do have windows but seldom use it so never back it up I also use clonezilla to copy a generic ubuntu install to test computers
Feb 27 22:03:00 yourwhiteshadow and these backup to a server?
Feb 27 22:04:07 toddc yes I understand rsynce can do windows and linux to server back ups and only backs up files that have changed
Feb 27 22:06:58 LostPenguin 25gb a of 2007
Feb 27 22:08:13 toddc http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync
Feb 27 22:09:48 toddc since ny servers are only in a testing mode right now I do not use it a lot but once installed I want to nightly back ups with it between servers
Feb 27 22:15:22 * tagumcity has quit (Quit: Bye)
Feb 27 22:15:44 * tagumcity (~tagumcity@wsip-68-14-225-33.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined #Ubuntu-US-AZ
Feb 27 22:17:16 toddc several of the UAT students will be testing (hacking) my server this weekend  that should be cool to see how weak it is
Feb 27 22:20:45 tagumcity yes very much so, it will be interesting to see what comes from it
Feb 27 22:21:33 tagumcity what is loaded on that server right now? is that the atom box?
Feb 27 22:22:42 LostPenguin unless there is something else ya'll need from me I'm gonna head to bed
Feb 27 22:23:34 LostPenguin I'll take that as a no, GN all
Feb 27 22:23:45 * LostPenguin has quit ()
