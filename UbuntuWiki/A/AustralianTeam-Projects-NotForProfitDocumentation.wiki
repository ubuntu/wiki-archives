== Aim ==

Create a collection of presentations, case studies and resources for using and promoting Ubuntu and FLOSS software in Not-For-Profit and community organisations.

Status: Part of Ubuntu Australia Documentation Project / Ongoing

Started: Mon, 8 May 2006

In particular, if you have any case studies or arguments of why using Ubuntu makes sense for Not-For-Profit organisations, please let me know. Create a Wiki page with the details, and add the link here (or let PaulSchulz know).

==== Not for Profit e-business Report, December 2006 ====
* Author: John Sheridan of Digital Business Insights
* Email:  johnsh12@bigpond.net.au

This report is about the use of ICT in the Australian ICT sector. It is not a report about the use of Ubuntu of Free and Open Source Software. It does give a good insight though into what Australian Non-for-profit organisations are using, and what is being promoted as 'best practice' within the industry.

From the article (1 August 2006):
<pre>
Extremadura, Spain's poorest region, made headlines following a 2002 decision to migrate about 70,000 desktops and 400 servers in its schools to a locally tailored version of Debian called gnuLinEx.

The government has estimated that the total cost of this project was about 190,000 euros (£130,000), 18 million euros lower than if the schools had purchased Microsoft software.
