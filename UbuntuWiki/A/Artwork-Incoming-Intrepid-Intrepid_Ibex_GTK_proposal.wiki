== GTK-theme proposal ==

This page is for GTK theme proposals.
I suggest that we use the pixmap engine.

'''Why pixmap engine?'''

To create a theme that looks nice and '''new''' we need to use this engine or create a complete new engine (which is a lot of work), otherwise we just create a different murrine/clearlooks/aurora theme.

+  The good thing about the engine is that it is very very flexible. You can create all widgets in gimp or inkscape and then use the pixmap engine to create a theme.

-  The bad thing is that some people think it's "slow" (the engine is only milliseconds slower than other engines depending on the size of the used .pngs). 

Everybody who wants to participate should create mockups of
specific elements of the GTK-theme (for example: buttons) and post them. Then the
mockups can be improved by others, until a final decision for the specific element is
made.

Of course this makes only sense if there is a guideline for the widget-mockups (without it, this would result in a mess of random mockups that don't fit well together). 

=== Concept ===

The theme should use bright colors (dark themes create too many unsolvable problems).

A mod of the current ubuntu-color-scheme could be used.

The basic colors:

I suggest that we make the bg-color a little bit darker, and the selected-bg-color more saturated.

'''BG-COLOR:'''

'''SELECTED-BG-COLOR:v

=== Concept Art ===

Here are some mockups I made:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:testt.png]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:test.png|Fullsize]]</nowiki> Image by Kimmik
|}

After playing around a little bit I found a style that is a compromise between the old human-theme and elements of the Kith/Kin mockups.
It features glossyness (like Kin) and more color:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:test2t.png]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:test2.png|Fullsize]]</nowiki> Click to see all widgets /Image by Kimmik
|}

You can see that it already works (thanx to the awesome pixmap engine).

Next try with more colors etc.:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:test3t.png]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:test3.png|Fullsize]]</nowiki> Click to see all widgets /Image by Kimmik
|}

Theme almost finished:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:desktopt.jpg]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:desktop.jpg|Fullsize]]</nowiki> large file!! /Image by Kimmik
|}

=== HUMAN 2 ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="text-align:center"><nowiki>[[File:screenshott.png]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:screenshot.png|Fullsize]]</nowiki> large file!! /Image by Kimmik
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Human 2 GTK
| <nowiki>[[attachment:Human-2.tar.gz|Download]]</nowiki>
|-
| Human 2 Emerald
| <nowiki>[[attachment:Human-2.emerald|Download]]</nowiki>
|}

=== Comments ===

* I really like Human 2 and am trying it right now. However I dislike the reduced size of entries in the Applications menu, I think the old big style is better. The orange highlight seems to be a tad over the top too. However, the input line highlights, the button, and tabs look simply gorgeous. The window background color was well chosen also. -- vperet <nowiki>[[DateTime]]</nowiki>
