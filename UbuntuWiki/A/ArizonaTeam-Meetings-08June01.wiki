[Sun Jun 1 2008] [21:05:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	Now, in addition to plugaz i'm pretty sure we are going to get ASULug on the Arizona State University Campus to help on this project. I think we can get rooms for the conference there, and there would be wireless too.
[Sun Jun 1 2008] [21:05:43] <johnc4510-laptop>	big plus
[Sun Jun 1 2008] [21:05:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	i think
[Sun Jun 1 2008] [21:06:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	But we still need contact with the tucson lugs and a couple of others in Phoenix. We need to think about getting speakers lined up. Sponsors if we can. A projector for the speakers to demo what they are presenting on.
[Sun Jun 1 2008] [21:06:16] <xHans>	if there is no money involved we can almost definitely get university for advancing technology for free

[Sun Jun 1 2008] [21:06:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	and i don't think we want to charge admission
[Sun Jun 1 2008] [21:07:00] <xHans>	let me know what groups you want in Phx, I might also be able to get to one or two in Tucson
[Sun Jun 1 2008] [21:07:01] <soldats>	true i have a friend in school there for computer tech so i can ask him when he registes again
[Sun Jun 1 2008] [21:07:22] <xHans>	well, money could be entrance charge for the event or selling booths
