__TOC__

* Synaptic brings an extra register to add new standard repositories like universe by a checklist. In adept you still have to do this a kind of manually. That takes longer, moreover you always have to check "apply" otherwise. 

* There a lots of option, too much if you ask me :) Maybe its possible to clean up the surface.

* We already talked about a switch that lets you change from "Add/Remove software" to "Adapt Manager"
