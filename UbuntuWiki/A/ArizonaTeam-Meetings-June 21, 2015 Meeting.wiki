 04:18 <MajB> Hi Hobbet1.  Enter +1

 04:18 <Ron_A> TEAM NEWS

 04:19 <Ron_A> It is that Time again to get AzLoCo re-approved as a Team again for another two years. MajB has started the renewal application at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Re-validationApplication2015

 04:19 <Ron_A> And now to MajB for information concerning our upcoming Re-Validation.

 04:19 <Ron_A> MajB please take it away.

 04:19 <MajB> OK.

 04:19 <MajB> Before I talk about re-val.  There are few other things.

 04:20 <MajB> 1.  The Team wiki page has been redone.  We are looking for comments, corrections, or additions.   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam

 04:20 <MajB> It has links to Team Projects  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/TeamProjects

 04:21 <MajB> and Team Reports  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/TeamReports

 04:21 <MajB> We are particularly looking for someone to take a hard look at the Server Team page  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Server

 04:21 <MajB> for corrections and additions.  You can edit yourself or send them to me (majb@azloco.com) and I will post them.

 04:21 <MajB> 2.  We are looking for a Membership Team Czar.  Any volunteers?

 04:22 <MajB> 3.  Re-validation with the Ubuntu LoCo Council.  Please have a look at the Re-validation Application Page  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Re-validationApplication2015

 04:22 <MajB> Comments, corrections, or edits again can be sent to me for posting.

 04:23 <MajB> Thank you Ron_A.  That is all I have.

 04:23 <Ron_A> MajB Thanks

 04:23 <Ron_A> We must appear before the loco council on or before September 17 2015 to stay as a approved team Please look over the application and help us get all the details correct and add your testimonial at the  bottom. Once we are ready I will setup a meeting with the loco council. The more members that can attend the online meeting the better the chance we have to get reapproved.

 04:23 <Ron_A> https://www.facebook.com/UbuntuAZTeam and http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/33tjao/calling_ubuntu_users/

 04:24 <Ron_A> We are still getting lots of hits on azloco.org since we started posting articles and would like to continue to add articles.

 04:24 <Ron_A> If you are working on a project what better to way to document it and let others know about it.

 04:24 <Ron_A> See any team member for access to the blogs and any that should be moved to the front page let us know about it.

 04:24 <Ron_A> LINUX QUOTES

 04:25 <Ron_A> I've felt strongly that the advantage of Linux is that it doesn't have a niche or any special market, but that different individuals and companies end up pushing it in the direction they want, and as such you end up with something that is pretty balanced across the board. Linus Torvalds

 04:25 <toddc> pavlos: thanks you for the testimonial
