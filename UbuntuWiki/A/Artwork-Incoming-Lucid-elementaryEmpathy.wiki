=== elementary: Empathy ===

After deciding to switch to the new IM client of GNOME I started to develop a theme to integrate it into our elementary interface. I started working from vectors published by DanRabbit and, after little modification, I used the color scheme of elementary icons theme to adapt them to the interface. 24x24 icons are positioned in the upper panel, notification area, which is why I used the totally gray vettors. The colored icons 16x16 and 22x22 are used in the interface of the program, they include states (online, busy, away, etc) but also the action, if there is a new message, and applications, the two stars are been replaced. The theme is beautiful, and brings an air of innovation built a program with infinite potential, but still must grow.
