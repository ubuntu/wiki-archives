[Sunday 14 February 2010] [21:06:18] <scott_ev>	We'll have wifi access too.  It's going to be a good chance to eat some good grub, have a few drinks or brewski's and meet some of the other UbuGeeks that you have only met online. You're not going to want to miss this.

[Sunday 14 February 2010] [21:06:43] <scott_ev>	Someone can pick out new features in 10.04 and present them or concentrate on one for example.  Anything to do with Ubuntu will be OK.  Things like how to navigate Launchpad and report bugs...

[Sunday 14 February 2010] [21:06:57] <scott_ev>	Actually, if you have a favorite piece of software that you use you can present that even if it's not in Ubuntu's repos.  Please be thinking about this.  It will only make the Release Party more of a success.
