Hello! I am a student in Strategic Management at the Tilburg University Faculty of Economics (NL, GMT+1), am 25 years old and IT nuts.
My interests are in improving the Ubuntu User experience and hope to aid in adoption of the ordinary home/office users. I feel that Ubuntu offers a good alternative to other OS'es like Windows or RedHat especially because of the huge user base that provides the community with support.

As a 'strategist' I classify Ubuntu's business strategy as decentralized and emergent (from time to time evolutionary). As a starting Ubuntu user and business student I am looking into the organization of Ubuntu (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Organization).
