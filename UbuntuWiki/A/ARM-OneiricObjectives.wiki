=== Fresh Ideas for Oneric on Arm ===
Whiteboard for brainstorming about ARM specific Oneric blueprints

If you've an idea, please add it. If you have comments, please put them beneath the idea. 

==== ogra brainstorm ====

(not all of the below will be valid as spec, this is just a brain dump)

* Develop proper ship mechanism for shipping non-installed packages on preinstalled images (i.e. pre-populate apt-cache) for langpacks, server packages, etc
* ARM thin clients (c/o from natty)
* Work out and publish a proper documentation people can follow to get unsupported community builds for their ARM HW (which packages/code needs to be touched, which people to connect to to get changes merged etc).
* re-vive netinstall images. for server installations (requires implementation of partman reciepes we dont have atm)
* public arm PPAs (c/o from natty, inspect the possibility to use usb booting instead of addon board and SD card)
* participate in debians/linaros ongoing flash-kernel rewrite to make sure our requirements are met too
* redesign the way to trigger flash-kernel in linux postinst (see bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/701698) according to upstream the armel linux packages need to handle initramfs and bootloader config updates through the kernel packages, not through flash-kernel calls in update-initramfs
* raw boot partition, use a non filesystem partition to hold bootloader and kernel on the SD instead of vfat

==== GrueMaster brainstorm ====
* develop method for using a hwpack overlay to base images for specific platform support (i.e. Nokia n900, blaze, etc).
* btrfs support for rootfs.  May require jasper-growroot to convert after resize.

==== rsalveti brainstorm ====

* make sure tftp is enable at u-boot and also support additional boot methods (musb?). That with netinstall images can work without using any sd cards.
* check if the gl/gles proxy library can be used, so we don't need to change everything to be gles at ARM (soon it'll be possible to have gl hardware on arm too)

==== jani ideas ====
* SD image performance improvements - align to 4Mb, consider Btrfs
* have a good Adobe Flash player available (test and improve lightspark for ARM)
* evaluate providing LibreOffice on the image considering that ARM hw gets faster and LibO gets leaner.
* improve QA FTBFS page/ general FTBFS tracking workflow to be more useful for ARM team
* see if/how booting time from power on to usable desktop can be improved on the default SD images
