This issue of the Arizona Team Newsletter is again being written by
Jacob. We are all glad to have Jacob back. There were 2 new members at
the last meeting and we were glad to welcome them the Ubuntu-Arizona
Team. Justin aka W9fyi lives in Phoenix and is new to the Ubuntu
experience. We have learned some new things trying to help Justin get up
and running.  Justin is blind and must use Orca, a speech program that
actually talks to him on his computer, and I for you am amazed at how
quick he has caught on. He is interested in helping the team out where
ever he can. One idea Justin has is to write some tutorials on the
accessibility programs he is using to help aide others who might need it
in the future. Marty aka Martyd215 was the other new attendee. Marty
says he has been using computers since he could read or before, and that
he has be using Ubuntu for about a year now and really likes it. Marty
has been hanging out in our channel quite a bit of late, and I know he
is going to be a valued member of the team.

Don't forget these links for helping us get going on our quest for
Ubuntu LoCo Team Approval:

There are a lot of you folks out there who are signed up as team
members, but who aren't participating at present. We encourage you to
come visit us in our team IRC Channel #ubuntu-arizona and get to know
us. We have a great group that hangs out there and would enjoy the
chance to get to know you, and help with any Ubuntu related problems you
are having!

Summary of last meeting July 15, 2007

The meeting started out with the usual greetings and the introduction of the two new members that are listed above, and we are very pleased to have them involved with this group!

John reported that the average amount of words a day in this channel was 1036! 

Once again I (Jacob) is back writing the newsletter after taking last week off for a family death. Everything is okay and I am glad to be back in the swing of things. Thank you for all the support from this group!

Br24 is making great strides with the education page to help new users get familiar with Ubuntu. If anyone wants to help br24 with his education page please contact him and offer up any help. The site can be found here:

Bluecat9 offered a new solution to the C4K project to bring money to the group to use as the group sees fit. Bluecat9 wants to change the C4K page into a donation page where companies can donate cash and other items to the group and we can use the funds to buy computers to help support the C4K project. The idea passed with flying colors and Bluecat9 is getting started on that. I (Jacob2440) was voted to take care of the tax and accounting side of getting this ball rolling. I will be getting a Tax Id Number (EIN) for the group. I will be making the group a non-profit and all banking will be done online. I will come out with more details at the next meeting and if anyone has an issue with this, or wants more information please contact me ASAP. 

John setup a meeting for the marketing for Wednesday night, and he will be able to fill in any questions people have.

This meeting was very productive and if anyone needs the details of the meeting, you can find a transcript on the team's wiki page. Thank you again for keeping me and my family in your thoughts.
