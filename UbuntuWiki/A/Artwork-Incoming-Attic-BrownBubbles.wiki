More from the department of 'outlandish experiments' :S

Something I did made this really 'noisy'..the colours aren't smooth anymore - almost certainly the hues shift from blue (see <nowiki>[[http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=12366|this]]</nowiki>.

Just so we can get an idea of what orange, brown glassy things look like (when done by me - maybe you can make them better!)

<nowiki>[[File:brownmonstrosity.jpg]]</nowiki>

Bear in mind - I didn't design this in brown, I hue shifted and tweaked (a fair bit) a blue wallpaper - it was actually quite nice before I butchered it :P Original <nowiki>[[http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=12366|here]]</nowiki>
