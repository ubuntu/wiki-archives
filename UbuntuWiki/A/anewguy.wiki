ABOUT ME:
   
     I have been using Ubuntu for a few years now.  I think I started back in version 6 or 7, but I really don't remember.  I wouldn't consider myself an expert by any means.

MY INVOLVEMENT:

     I started out on the Ubuntu forums as user gcos7.  I was very stupid at the time and posted some comments I shouldn't have (sorry Bodhi).  But I learned I was being a jerk so I just quit using that userid, hoping it would fade away into nothingness and help hide my embarrassment.  After a while I created a new userid, anewguy, and used it up until I had a disagreement with something in a post and rashly asked for my account to be deactivated.  After a few weeks I realized that was a mistake and went with the userid wep940.  Just recently I asked for my anewguy account to be reactivated and I've been using it since (and will continue to).

     Why do I mention all of this?  Well, when I first got on I was green and did some dumb things - I learned.  Later, I was wanting to use anewguy again, but figured it couldn't be reactivated, so I went by wep940.  So, when I found out I could reactivate my anewguy account I wanted to do so.   Why?  I couldn't stay away from the forums.  I like to at least TRY to help people where I can on the Absolute Beginners Forum.

ADDITIONAL ITEMS:

     I really don't remember under which ID now, and since my anewguy account was deactivated and reactivated it either reset something so not all of my posts show, or the older stuff has been archived or deleted.  I did create 2 "how-to"s:

How To Remove Ubuntu And Go Back To Windows

     I did this at a time when a lot of people were jumping into Ubuntu without even seeing it, with the result that many were trying to go back to Windows, because they just "didn't get it".  Most of the time these users would end up deleting the Ubuntu partition without resetting the Windows mbr so they ended up crying for help.  My how to was a guide to simply resetting the Windows mbr before they removed Ubuntu (with the hope they'd leave the partition there to come back to later!).  The last time I actually found this how-to it had many views and many people have added other ways to it, creating something I hope helped a lot of people.  I created this how-to so that the user wouldn't have the mbr problem and therefore not leave a sour taste with them that they would blame on Ubuntu.

How To Install Ubuntu On A Gateway MX3215

    First off, I *think* that was the name - it's been a long time!  In those days you had to work to get Broadcom wireless adapters working and the laptop also had a Via (?) Unichrome video chipset which was a challenge as well.  I thought after what I went through (also read as "I learned a lot") I might share it with others with the same or similar laptop so they wouldn't have to go through the hassles of trying to figure it all out.  I hope it was helpful to some.

How To Install Ubuntu - An Illustrated Guide

     I created this guide using screen copies from an actual installation.  In my case it was for installing to an external hard disk, but the guide works for an internal disk as well.  Includes manual partitioning.  This guide can be found at http://ubuntuone.com/6snmL8cnGbpYPBegqcHrnr

OTHER INTERESTS

     Being an ex-systems programmer and system administrator on big iron from "back in the day", I sort of lost interest in some things computer related.  While Ubuntu changed that, in the mean time I love working on my family history.  I find it interesting to learn all about family I never knew I had from way back when.

     I have also liked to bowl, play handball, ride a bike and even fly a kite.  A back injury now prevents me from any of those activities, and I am on disability.  So I developed a new interest as a result:  I *love* learning things on the History channel and on History International on T.V.

     When I was working, a 10-foot long row of technical manuals made any other reading not appealing.  In the last few years I have taken up reading like I used to when I was younger.  I enjoy a good mystery, but I also really like things historical in nature, and even a good Knights Templar "conspiracy" read.  I use a Kindle, and I have one of the several hundred page Ubuntu Guide books on it so I can use for reference.  This was a recent addition - maybe it will make my replies better on the forum!  ;)

     I do pretty much keep to myself, so my best friend in the world is my cat Buddy.  He's "just" a big old bundle of the friendliest, loving, gentle soul you have ever seen.  I do love him very much and I sure at least hope that it's mutual.  They can be like dealing with a 5 year old kid, sometimes amusing, sometimes frustrating, but still wonderful.  He was recently diagnosed with chronic kidney failure, so I'm not sure how much time he has left - I hope a long time!

MY HOPES WITH UBUNTU

     I really want to keep learning more and more.  I'd like to get to a point where I might be considered for a position as a beginners forum administrator.

I guess that about does it.  It's me in a nutshell!
