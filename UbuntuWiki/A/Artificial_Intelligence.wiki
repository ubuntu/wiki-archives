=== About Me ===

I'm 33 years old man from Denmark. I have been using Linux since 2000, exclusive only Linux since 2004. The first Linux distro I used back in 2000 was Corel Linux. From 2002 I moved to Mandrake (Mandriva). When the beta version of Ubuntu 4.10 became public in 2004 I was hooked ever since. 

I have been a member of ubuntuforums.org since day one and became a moderator in 2005 and have been active on the boards ever since.
Several guides/howto I have been written, though they are obsolete today.

<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=136064|How to install AVG (2006)]]</nowiki> - 500.000 views 

<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=77694|Howto setup desktop eyecandy (2005)]]</nowiki> - 250.00 views

<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/search.php?searchid=81740699|All my guides on the forums]]</nowiki>

Most of the guides I have written are not related to ubuntuforums.org, but part of gwos.org project (which is dead now). Where more than +200 game installation guides I wrote, plus an enormous list of game list of Linux/Ubuntu. 

Then I have written a bunch of How to install Window Games on Ubuntu: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuevolution.wordpress.com/|Ubuntu Evolution]]</nowiki>

My passion is gaming on Linux, so I read all the threads (and moderating) in our Gaming forum and Wine Forum everyday. I have been fighting for a new structure of our game forum to split into native games forum and non-Linux/emulation games.

But a lot time goes with spambot hunting, which I have a keen nose to detect - even those who are actually good at mimicking as a person(s).
What I want is a stronger spambot defense, as spam is a nuisance for our members and the spambots uses every loophole they can find. 

Then we have the public service of ubuntuforums.org, moving threads, solve a dispute, answer questions regarding the forums/rules, which is a part of the everyday job.
