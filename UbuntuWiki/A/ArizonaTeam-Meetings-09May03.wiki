21:05 < johnc4510> Ubuntu Open Week finished up last Friday, and as usual, it was a great 5 days of sessions geared toward helping the community get involved. The list of prominent Ubuntu community members hosting sessions was, as always, impressive. You can find the logs of all the Ubuntu Open Week Sessions here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek just scroll down the page to "The Timetable" header and click on any session titleto read the logs.

21:12 < johnc4510> a little more money i thing at 359
21:12 < johnc4510> and i think you can get different drives for extra
21:12 < johnc4510> but it's nice for sure
21:12 < tyche> Not considering that it's got more on it for SSD than the one I bought for $512
21:12 < johnc4510> :)

21:28 < MatthewMPP> I was going to 1 run Kubuntu and 1 run Xubuntu, however Kubuntu was buggy, and it's a lot simpler to have just 1 distro.

21:32 < johnc4510> sure
21:32 < johnc4510> that works for me
