 04:08 <toddc> http://www.datamation.com/open-source/why-you-should-or-shouldnt-switch-to-each-leading-linux-desktop-1.html

 04:08 <toddc> TEAM NEWS

 04:08 <toddc> over to MajB for some Southern Az news.

 04:08 <MajB> Thank you.

 04:09 <MajB> The Cyber Patriot Competition is for middle schools and high schools.  There are open divisions and service (JROTC - Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Civil Air Patrol, and Coast Guard I think) divisions.  It is a national competition.  Each team consists of 2-5 members with an optional alternate.  The Competition is almost over for this year.

 04:09 <MajB> What they are doing is teaching these students about cyber security in Linux (Ubuntu this year) and Microsoft Windows and then they compete to see if they have done a good job learning.  Their competition tests them as system administrators.  I believe it is anticipated that this will peak their interest and gently push them toward an education in computer technology, mathematics, and other sciences.

 04:10 <MajB> Anyway there are 43 teams registered this year that are participating from all over the state.  Sixteen of those teams, over 37%, are from Cochise County (out in the boonies.)  So far, at the high school level, Buena High School (Sierra Vista) has the the top two teams in the Open and the Service Divisions in Arizona.  At the Middle School level, 3 teams from Smith Middle School (Fort Huachuca) and one from Valley View Elementary (Hereford)

 04:10 <MajB> That's all I have.

 04:11 <wmack> impressive rep of s az!

 04:11 <toddc> thank you MajB for all the events and news from there!
