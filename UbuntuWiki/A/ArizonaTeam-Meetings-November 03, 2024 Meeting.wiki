 04:10 <toddc> LINUX QUOTES/JOKES

 04:10 <toddc> The Linux philosophy is 'Laugh in the face of danger'. Oops. Wrong One. 'Do it yourself'. Yes, that's it

 04:10 <toddc> A lot of that momentum comes from the fact that Linux is free.

 04:11 <toddc> I don't have any authority over Linux other than this notion that I know what I'm doing. Linus

 04:11 <toddc> Those who don't understand Linux are doomed to reinvent it, poorly.
