=== About me ===

I am an Ubuntu user and contributor from Russia. I have turned to Ubuntu since Warty and never looked back, because I've seen many things done right from the very first release. I've started contributing to the project since Dapper by translating documentation and software.

=== Contributions to Ubuntu ===

I am an active member of the ubuntu-l10n-ru team, working mainly on translations. Sometimes, I also fix the bugs and hope to become a MOTU in the future.

Detailed list of contributions for the Membership board: <nowiki>[[ArtemPopov-Activity]]</nowiki>

=== Plans and ideas ===

* To become a member.
* To become a MOTU.
* To become a sponsor. Because, sometimes I have to wait for sponsorship way too long myself.
* To always try new ways of contributing.
