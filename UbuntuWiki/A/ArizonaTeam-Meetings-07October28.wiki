Oct 28 21:16:28 <johnc4510>	first
Oct 28 21:16:41 <johnc4510>	The server is in place for us to use for education and support of the team. Now, as far as education goes, we invisioned using the server to help teach the team members the technology and inner workings of a server. Also to help us in learning html and other applications used for the design of web pages. For the support end of it, we want to link to pages that will be usefull to new and prospective members. Both of these things will 
Oct 28 21:16:41 <johnc4510>	take time and support of the membership. To begin with members can ask slofgren for access to the server to set up a page that links to other pages they may have somewhere else. Like a blog or something. You can ask for access by emailing slofgren at slofgren@gmail.com You must be a registered member of the AZ mailing list and also the AZ launchpad team.
Oct 28 21:17:04 <johnc4510>	.

Oct 28 21:23:09 <johnc4510>	yes. i have a small prepared text about that
Oct 28 21:23:13 <slofgren>	I am not certain that this arangment is to our best interest
Oct 28 21:23:24 <johnc4510>	For my part, I held back on buying the domain name this last week due to some difference of opinion with the DeLUG group in Phoenix. I wasn't sure if these differences would or would not lead to a delay of our server project. For now, we have come to an agreement, and we will continue on with this project. So this coming week, I will buy the domain name. AZLoco.org
Oct 28 21:23:35 <br24>	enigmastrat, did you do any of the graphics?

Oct 28 21:24:25 <johnc4510>	hang on guys

Oct 28 21:26:52 *	bender_ is now known as runlevel

Oct 28 21:28:48 <johnc4510>	that's why we questioned it
Oct 28 21:28:53 <slofgren>	my first thought
Oct 28 21:28:54 <Polygon89>	and does it really effect us?
Oct 28 21:29:00 <Polygon89>	cause they are using seperate accounts...
Oct 28 21:29:06 <slofgren>	just a worng purpose
Oct 28 21:29:07 <johnc4510>	and the fact that we thought it was for our team use only
Oct 28 21:29:07 <Polygon89>	unless they are gonna use the whole hd or something
Oct 28 21:29:11 <Polygon89>	ah.
Oct 28 21:29:14 <slofgren>	it was donated for our use
Oct 28 21:29:47 <enigmastrat>	What kind of hardware is it?
