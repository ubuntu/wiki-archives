=== Concept ===
A concept I had. I figure someone is going to do the feather texture soon (a la "elephant" and "lion") so I tried something else. I know the colors are wrong, and the branding may be much, but it was an idea I had. My attempt at an orange/brown sky had little success. Maybe someone else can make it work? I originally had the "flare" set so that I could only see the Ubuntu logos clearly when I tilted my laptop screen a certain way, as I'm of an anti-branding bent and prefer things subtle. I also hope my Heron doesn't look too much like a goose.
