=== Testimonials ===

Aanjhan is a highly brilliant (even more better word is a genius) in electronics and is always committed to the development of floss/gnu software and spreading the same to various youngsters like me.. He is the mainstay of Ubuntu India and he has done a lot to spread floss especially ubuntu in India.. I support him in his every endeavor and I have got few words for you mate.. KEEP ON ROCKING :) -- <nowiki>[[Bhavani_Shankar| Bhavani Shankar]]</nowiki> (August 3rd 2008)   

Aanjhan is a long-time contributor to Ubuntu and a great colleague to work with. He's been an active part of MOTU Science and #ubuntu-motu. I heartily recommend him as an Ubuntu Member. -- Jordan Mantha (aka LaserJock)

I first started working with Aanjhan on science packages (specifically xcircuit) back in the Breezy days.  He is very diligent and thorough.  He has come a long way since then including the addition of new packages.  I certainly have no reservations in recommending him. -- Barry deFreese (aka bddebian)

Aanjhan is a Free software lover all the way and really enthusiastic guy. There aren't many people around who can write code, carry out install fests, give presentations about FOSS and communicate on mail/IRC with same enthusiasm and focus.
I know him due to work on gnusim8085 and it is he who keeps pushing a lazy guy like me. He has lot of patience and is very thorough in whatever he does. All in all a nice friend and a great community member. -- Onkar Shinde (aka slytherin)

Aanjhan (tuxmaniac) is always source of energy to me. He motivates, encourages and helps to everyone in every possible way he can. Apart from his technical knowledge, he is great community member too. Proud to get friend like him -- Kartik Mistry (kart_)
