Wall-light is my ubuntu art area, am planning to update regularly with my musings....

Vote for it: http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/11805/ <<BR>>
Digg it: http://digg.com/linux_unix/Vote_for_a_beautiful_usable_Ubuntu

== Description ==

A collection of modern interface designs can be seen on my deviant art page, please leave comments there too.

Here a the brand new designs:

{{http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs31/i/2008/215/0/b/Interpid_Ibex_Mockup_Part_2_by_willwill100.png}}

I would love it if these designs received some serious consideration, Ubuntu appears to be just content to settle for the poor and unattractive orange designs. Whilst the current Ubuntu designs have worked until now, if we want to extent the appeal a real rethink and transformation needs to be undertaken. I will add commentaries to each design in due course. Stand by!

Just a simple wallpaper for Intrepid Ibex (Its pretty rubbish but ill leave it up out of nostalgia):

Hopefully this area will extend into desktop mockups, colour schemes etc similar to my previous entry for hardy (can be found here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Hardy/Alternate/Walllight)

Use footnotes, attachments, and like where appropriate. 
* I think this is excellent, i love the sense of the mystical in it and it fits very well with ubuntu, i certainly prefer this type of wallpaper to the purely algorythmical vistaish sort that has become popular recently (like the gutsy default). however there are two problems, firstly you need to get rid of the ubuntu logo, i dont think it goes with the paper (it sort of sits in too a arbitrary position and its colour contrast clashes with the rest of the wallpaper) and i personally dislike ubuntu logos on wallpapers on principle (unless subtle i.e the birth of ubuntu paper which was awesome) secondly i dont think the ibex logo has been merged with the backround perfectly and at the moment has an annoying gey splodgy outline. if you address these two problems i think it will be a really great wall paper and better i think perhaps that the hardy one and certainly better than the gutsy one.

* I love the contrast and I love the black icon. Not a lot of complaints besides the lack of flow between the Ibex and the Ubuntu logo. That being said, please don't place the Ubuntu logo inside the Ibex, that just looks cheesy.

* Nice but the colours are too vivid. -- Cutter3 
* I'm really digging the theme, and I think that it would work great if people could customize the theme to their liking in the settings alá Clearlooks.  Gets my vote!

* Rounded corners in menus just don't work IMHO... -- VinNL 
* Gorgeous. Hope you can make the real one soon. --vperetokin<<DateTime>>

* Amazing, absolutely amazing. Keep up the great work!

* <nowiki>[[http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/shuttleworth-oscon-keynote.ars|Mark Shuttleworth]]</nowiki> I hope you are paying attention. Unfortunately AFAIK this mockup is not currently possible. - Jojoman02
 
* I love it! It is beautiful, and most of it actually can be done. Maybe the dock should be less OSX-like, but other than that, this is the first theme I would use as-is. Ubuntu should settle to this minimalist style, and even though the mock-ups could not be replicated 100%, here's the direction Ubuntu should take. I simply love it!

* I like the GDM very much. But the desktop mockup looks too much like a hybrid of Vista and OS X. Modifications need to be done if this mockup where to be finalized in Intrepid Ibex, in order to make Ubuntu having its own identity rather than 'stealing' ideas from other OSes, like some OSes have been criticized for. -- kenji <<DateTime>>

* This is simply stunning, and the general consensus on Digg agrees. This is the direction Ubuntu needs to go with its theme. I would have no hesitation in recommending Ubuntu to everyone I know with a theme like this. -- belovedmonster

* I made a GTK theme based off of this idea. It's not perfect, and it may need some tweaking. Check it out at http://68.55.24.12/MurrinaIbex.tar.bz2 -- ryawn <<DateTime>>

* Really like it as well - behind the nice colours are usability improvements (Love the login screen) -- YannHamon <<DateTime>>

* If this mockup could be made into an actual theme I would definitely use it, be it the default theme of Intrepid or not. But I think it has some quite big technical problems. It has been pointed out (by Cory K) that this theme needs compositing - and users with no such capabilities are not able to use it. But still I think it deserves to be made into an actual theme -  I recommend to the author to start organizing his team and begin work with it - not mock ups any more. -- Aethralis 2008-08-07 17:56:34 

* I don't mean to be a show stopper, but this is pretty much useless until its actually been turned into a real theme. I must admit though, it is very pretty, however, like Aethralis and Cory K have said, it would need compositing and we do not want to cut off half Ubuntu's user base with a nice looking theme. We don't want to become like Vista. --LostOverThere <nowiki>[[DateTime]]</nowiki>

* If Ubuntu ever wants to be taken really serious by the mainstream market, it has to be able to compete with the graphics of Mac OS X and Windows Vista. Although the default orange/brown theme that has been used until now isn't bad, it isn't as professional looking as this one, which is stunning. I really like it and I hope it will get a chance. However, to achieve this the author needs to create a theme from this mock-up as fast as possible and submit -- or ask someone to submit -- patches that allow the things that GNOME currently can't do.  -- <nowiki>[[Qense]]</nowiki>

* I have to say that I ''love'' it. I'm really impressed. Maybe it doesn't fit human 100 percent, but then I have to say: to hell with human! ''This'' is a mockup that - if realised - will put Ubuntu to the front of all the distros. No more need for Mint Linux, Sabayon or whatever they are called. And no more talking 'bout "Ohh, Gnome is so ugly, use KDE as standard for Ubuntu!" The GDM looks incredible and with a little bit more finetuning for the gtk theme it'd be perfect. And I have to say rounded menus work very well - anyway they do in OS X. But the corners in this mockup are a very little bit too big, more decent ones would probably be better. And the gradient of the menu adjoins ugly with the gradient of the "Places" Button. Anyway Ubuntu is probably not ''gutsy'' enough to implement the dock, maybe they are in fear that some users don't like it. But why don't ask the user during installation what he prefers? -- <nowiki>[[DanielT]]</nowiki>
