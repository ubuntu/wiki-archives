My contributions to Ubuntu are Alpha and beta heavy testing on my 4 machines. I am creating Baltix GNU/Linux a Ubuntu based distribution for Lithuania Latvia and Estonia. I have reported some bugs, I write review about Ubuntu on http://pirate.lt/ (not many reviews for now). I like game testing and making installers for windows games for Ubuntu. I write a review of open source games running on Linux (Ubuntu). And so on.

I am planning to make a new Ubuntu based distro orietated for Windows games running on Linux. It will be heavely modofied Ubuntu for speed. Using XFCE4 as WM and 64 only. I will contribute to WINE project (but my programming skills are not very high at the moment). The alpha release is planned for middle of 2009 year. It will be called LPGamer (Linux Pirate Gamer). The scheme will be black and icons will be drawn by myself (perhaps).

Thats all folks. Vistit http://pirate.lt/ if you want to read my thoughts, review and so on.
