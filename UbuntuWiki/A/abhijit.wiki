=== About Me ===

Namskar, I am Abhijit Navale from <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra|Maharashtra State]]</nowiki>, India. I am a Computer Engineering Student at <nowiki>[[http://www.mu.ac.in/|Mumbai University]]</nowiki>. C and C++ are my favorite programming languages. I like to program. I am always testing new technologies in software fields which are related to end user. I am less interested in backend. 

My introduction to Linux was like everyone eles's.
We were doing a robotic project and we need to program a microcontroller. We dont have its programming kit at that time which was expensive. My friend Vishal suggested me that in Linux there is free programme available, and he showed me the Ubuntu first time. After enough introduction about Linux from him, my first question was that , "If this whole damn thing is free (free as in beer! ;) ) then why people use MS? and why not Linux?"
 ....and then I dive into Linux world in to deep. I thanks Vishal for introducing me to Linux. :) 

=== My Contribution ===

I generally prefer to contribute by helping new comers in #ubuntu. I hang a lot there in #ubuntu to help. (And to take help! :) ). 
You can contact me there for any Ubuntu related help or discussion!

At the writing of this page, I am new to Ubuntu BugSquad. I am now slowly learning how to triage and about bugs. 

Also I write some community wiki for ubuntu e.g. <nowiki>[[http://help.ubuntu.com/community/ibus | IBus]]</nowiki> community wiki is written by me.

You can contact me for presentation or workshop on FOSS, Linux or any specific technology, software.
