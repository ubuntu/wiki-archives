== Hardy Startup ==

Hi, I was bored in web design and decided to mess  around a little bit with ubuntu's startup screen
=== Concept ===
My concept is to make it pop and to brighten up those shades of oranges and brown
I really don't know how to do this edit but i am gonna make it through this
i really tried to put the ubuntu logo in it but...i am not the king of photoshop.
