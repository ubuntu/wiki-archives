[21:10] <toddcnb> You Know you are Addicted to the Internet When…
[21:10] <toddcnb> They say spending too much on the internet is bad for you... 
[21:11] <toddcnb> I wonder if there's a website to find out more information about it?
[21:11] <toddcnb> The 12-Step Program for Internet Addicts 
[21:11] <toddcnb> 1) I will have a cup of coffee in the morning and read my newspaper like I use to.
[21:11] <toddcnb> 2) I will eat breakfast with a knife and fork and not with one hand typing. 
[21:11] <toddcnb> 3) I will get dressed before noon. 
[21:12] <toddcnb> 4) I will make an attempt to clean the house, wash the dog, get the kids off to school, all before even thinking of the Internet. 
[21:12] <toddcnb> 5) I will sit down and write a letter to those unfortunate few friends and family that are Internet-deprived. 
[21:12] <toddcnb> ) I will call someone on the phone who I cannot contact via the Internet. 
[21:12] <toddcnb> 7) I will read a book...if I still remember how. 
[21:13] <toddcnb> 8) I will listen to those around me and their needs and stop telling them to turn the TV down so I can hear what is happening on the Web. 
[21:13] <toddcnb> 9) I will not be tempted during TV commercials to check for email. 
[21:13] <toddcnb> 10) I will try and get out of the house at least once a week, if it is necessary or not. 
[21:13] <toddcnb> 11) I will remember that my bank is not forgiving if I forget to balance my checkbook because I was too busy on my computer. 
[21:13] <toddcnb> 12) Last, but not least, I will remember that I must go to bed some time....and the Internet will always be there tomorrow!
