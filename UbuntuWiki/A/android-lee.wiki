'''Introduction'''
I've been in IT not long before the Windows 3.1 days and I have seen a lot of things come and go.  I have a strong passion for what I do and I firmly believe there is always at least two ways to do something.

'''Bragging rights'''
I've been a Google+ user since June of 2011, when the first beta invites went out. I've also been using an Android phone since OS version .8 (beta). I'm married to the most wonderful and loving woman in the world and I'm truly blessed to have a great son. I'm also a tester for Ubuntu. What's Ubuntu, you ask? Allow me to tell you all about it. :-)

'''Occupation'''
Network Administrator - I make sure all our internal users computers and servers are working, as well as all the software running on those machines. I also manage a fleet of 35 Android tablets and phones that or service techs use.
