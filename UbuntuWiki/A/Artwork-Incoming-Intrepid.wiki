=== What does Intrepid look like right now? ===
Well the best way to find out is to follow the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-art|Mailing List]]</nowiki>! However, if you are running ubuntu+1 you can see the current 'state' of things. You can also use this <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~kwwii/+archive|PPA]]</nowiki> for Hardy. Remember, though that until things are finalised selections are not set at all and can change quite completely.
