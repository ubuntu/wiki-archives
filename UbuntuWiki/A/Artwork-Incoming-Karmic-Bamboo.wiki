=== Bamboo ===
Bamboo is a beautiful plant with a very natural Ubuntu-related palette of tans, browns, and greens.  This could be captured into a modern clean-looking interface that preserves Ubuntu's feel, but makes it feel more modern

=== Concept ===
This theme is based on Dust and Dust Sand.  Really the only difference is the custom colors and the titlebar buttons.  This is also my first theme modification, so it could probably use some code debugging.

Also, the background was created with a photo I took of my bamboo cutting board, and a painting I got on the Web.  We would need a different, open background if this were to be used in a release, but I'm not a painter, and I wanted a proof-of-concept.

I used the GION icon theme, which I find clean and simple.  Other icon themes may be better.

This theme depends on both of the files attached below.  It might also depend on Dust and/or Dust-sand, but I'm not sure.
