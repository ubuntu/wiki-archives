'''Uprading the BIOS to at least 0601 is strongly recommended''' ''(Do not use EZ-Flash to flash BIOS if your BIOS version is prior to 0601.)''.

Everything works out of the box, no special configuration required excepting the installation of ATI VGA drivers ''(just enable "ATI accelerated graphics driver" in Restricted Drivers Manager)''.

Just installed Feisty Fawn on the Asus M2A-VM with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 4800+ CPU, a Maxtor 250 SATA Hard Drive and 2 gigs of DDR2 Ram.  At first the partitioner would not recognize the drive until I found the HD controller setting and changed it from IDE to AHCI.  Additionally I had to disable the acpi function for the installation to proceed beyond formatting and partitioning the hard drive.

=== Update 19 July 09 by gear3895 ===
On ASUS M2A-VM installed Ubuntu 7.04 8.04 9.04 with AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4000+, ATI Technologies Inc RS690 [Radeon X1200 Series], Kingston KVR667D2N5 1GB DDR2 RAM, Seagate SATA and Western Digital SATA, no problems, everything works out of box

=== Update 23 May 2010 by gear3895 ===
For Ubuntu 10.04 install, upon starting up after GRUB, the monitor shows flicks of black screen, as if it tries to adjust the display resolution for 4~5 seconds. This happens every time upon booting...
