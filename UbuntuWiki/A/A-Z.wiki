SEND MAIL WILL ATTACHMENTS:
You will need to install the following

sudo apt-get install mailx
sudo apt-get install mpack 

This will put the content of the attachment into the body
mailx -s "Subject" fred@home.com < attached-file.txt

This will attach a file called "attached-file.txt"
mpack -s 'Hello  - This a test file' attached-file.txt fred@home.com

This will send an attachment called "attached-file.txt" and use the contents of a file called "message-body" as the body of the message

mpack -s  'Hello' -d message-body attached-file.txt fred@home.com

This is the complete exercise

sudo apt-get install mailx mpack
echo "The is your file attachment" > ~/attached-file.txt
echo "Attached you will find your weekly report" > ~/message-body
mpack -s  'Weekly report' -d message-body attached-file.txt fred@home.com
