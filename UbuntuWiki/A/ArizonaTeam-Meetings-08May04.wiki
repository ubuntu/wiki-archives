[Sun May 4 2008] [21:06:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok next
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:06:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	installfests
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:06:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Installfest
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:06:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	coming up on May 17th
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:06:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	about 2 wks
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:07:26] <johnc4510-laptop>	first off ianmcorvidae has an idea to combine a signing party with the installfests
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:07:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	so
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:07:38] <johnc4510-laptop>	ianmcorvidae: could you inform us please
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:07:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:07:41] <soldats>	LETS GET THE FLYERS OUT THERE GUYS (PHOENIX)
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:07:41] <ianmcorvidae>	sure.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:08:30] <ianmcorvidae>	I can only speak for Tucson, of course, but myself and some folks unaffiliated with this group would like to do a keysigning (PGP, Thawte Web of Trust, CACert), and thought that doing it paired with the installfest could raise awareness of both
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:09:05] <ianmcorvidae>	there aren't many people in this group who use PGP/GPG much less any of the S/MIME variants, but it seems like this could draw more people, which is always preferable
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:09:25] <Hipstor__>	keysigning ?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:09:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'm not familiar with thawte web, and cacert??
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:09:32] <ianmcorvidae>	I don't know if anyone in phoenix wants to run a similar event.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:09:50] <ianmcorvidae>	thawte and cacert are both certificate authorities that grant individual certificates for signing email with
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:10:05] <ianmcorvidae>	both have a system of trust 'points' assigned by a trusted person within the network
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:10:06] <tyche>	If I knew what you meant, it might help.  I've got a gpg key, but I'm not sure what you mean by a signing.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:10:12] <ianmcorvidae>	heh, okay
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:10:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	Hipstor__: keysigning is an encrytion for peer to peer authentication
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:10:28] <ianmcorvidae>	the idea behind signing a key is that it backs up the authenticity of the owner
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:10:43] <ianmcorvidae>	because, obviously, anyone can create a key with whatever random data they want in it
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:11:04] <tyche>	How do they sign keys?  Especially if they don't have their computer there?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:11:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	and allows two or more people to share via authentication
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:11:24] <ianmcorvidae>	so, signing keys is typically done in person, and the idea is you make sure the person is who they (and their key) says they are and that they have control, and then you sign it at home (usually)
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:11:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	and know that they are sharing with a trusted source
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:11:38] <ianmcorvidae>	exactly
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:12:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: you have a key since you are an ubuntu member
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:12:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	but
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:12:07] <Hipstor__>	drivers licence for the internet
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:12:07] <ianmcorvidae>	if you read the newsletters, you'll see tyche's signature every week, which ensures that it comes from him (given the signature validates); most email clients have a system for this
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:12:12] <ianmcorvidae>	in a sense, yes :)
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:12:20] <johnc4510-laptop>	until you share and authenticate it, it not good for much
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:12:35] <tyche>	OK, that doesn't sound hard.  But how do you knowwhat the person's key is?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:12:46] <ianmcorvidae>	they tell you, typically
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:13:14] <ianmcorvidae>	there's something called a key 'fingerprint' that you can get (using gpg) using gpg --fingerprint <key>
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:13:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	ian am i right in thinking you only give and sign the public portion of the key?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:13:21] <ianmcorvidae>	that's what's typically used
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:13:28] <ianmcorvidae>	yes, you only EVER give out the public part
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:13:34] <DrPppr242>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:13:42] <ianmcorvidae>	thanks, DrPppr
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:13:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	DrPppr242: ty
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:14:01] <DrPppr242>	your welcome
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:14:03] <tyche>	OK, I've got a fingerprint of  EBE2 B7C9 7872 2F4B C542 D801 0CE5 AED3 C50A 6E95
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:14:08] <ianmcorvidae>	exactly
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:14:13] <johnc4510-laptop>	yep
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:14:16] <tyche>	Is that what I give to people?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:14:29] <ianmcorvidae>	and, given your key is on a keyserver somewhere, they can get your full public key from that
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:14:46] <DesertPenquin>	perhaps after the signing there could be a page on the web of the public keys signed at the event and a link to the PGP HOWTO
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:14:55] <paul928>	I think that ianmcorvidae is discussing a emerging technology that will become very important in the near future.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:14:58] <ianmcorvidae>	by the way, if it isn't, you should issue gpg --keyserver pgp.ubuntu.com --send-keys <key> :)
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:15:04] <ianmcorvidae>	not even close to emerging, but heh
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:15:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, how about this
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:15:26] <ianmcorvidae>	it's been used to sign Debian/Ubuntu packages since those respective operating systems came out; it's not well-known, but it is in use
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:15:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	ianmcorvidae: could you put all the particulars in a email to the team list
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:15:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	ie  how to get a key
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:15:42] <paul928>	emerging in the sense of popular use
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:15:44] <ianmcorvidae>	I will attempt to, certainly
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:15:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	what it is used for
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:15:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	etc?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:16:04] <ianmcorvidae>	sure
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:16:20] <ianmcorvidae>	I'll attempt to be concise, even, which clearly I haven't done well
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:16:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	then those that don't have keys can generate one and put it on their launchpad page
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:16:30] <ianmcorvidae>	yes, indeed
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:16:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	that makes it a published key
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:16:41] <ianmcorvidae>	(pgp keys are how one signs the ubuntu code of conduct, by the way)
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	and you should include how to generate a key and how to publish it on launchpad maybe
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:11] <kennymc0_laptop>	that would be cool
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:13] <ianmcorvidae>	yes, certainly
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:23] <tyche>	And how to use a fingerprint to find the person's public key.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	and paul928 is correct, it is a secure way to do things and a coming thing
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	good
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:46] <ianmcorvidae>	although: do people need to know these exact specifics to agree/disagree on having a keysigning party along with the installfest?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:49] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, that sounds like a great idea
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's not hard to do
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:17:56] <ianmcorvidae>	because there are some preliminary things that should be done, of course :)
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:02] <johnc4510-laptop>	and we can do it right at the installfest
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	right
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:17] <johnc4510-laptop>	that's why i wanted the email to instruct
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:29] <johnc4510-laptop>	we appreciate it ianmcorvidae
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	a great idea
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:38] <soldats>	ianmcorvidae: at least for tucson you can explain it to the eople who dont know as well as the others who arent apart of the group to explain as well so it should work
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:43] <ianmcorvidae>	okay :)
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:44] <tyche>	johnc4510-laptop: Would it be better on the Forum?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:56] <ianmcorvidae>	I'll get the preliminaries started and send out stuff to help people out
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:18:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	tyche: either way
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:19:08] <ianmcorvidae>	I'd prefer the mailing list, so I'll at least start it there.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:19:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	ianmcorvidae: you can use the forum or the email list
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:19:22] <ianmcorvidae>	which comes to a good point: when/where is the installfest, exactly?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:19:28] 	 * ianmcorvidae hands floor back to john
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:19:31] <tyche>	No problem.  I was thinking of putting it up on our forum as a sticky.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:19:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	i though we might have some back and forth on the list with this
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:19:55] 	 * johnc4510-laptop to all, the mail list is there for all to use
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:20:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	you can send a question or idea to the list for all members to see and comment on
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:20:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	is everyone signed up for the list?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:20:51] <kennymc0_laptop>	i get email from you guys
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:20:56] <kennymc0_laptop>	hee hee

[Sun May 4 2008] [21:32:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Installfest
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:32:15] <johnc4510-laptop>	that's the link again
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:32:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	install disk
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:32:37] <soldats>	its also on th eflyer which john gave the link to as well
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:32:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	if you are going to attend one of the installfests we need disks
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:33:13] <kennymc0_laptop>	i have a bunch of leftovers from the release party
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:33:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	it should be mostly ubuntu
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:33:27] <kennymc0_laptop>	so i think phoenix should be mostly covered
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:33:33] <johnc4510-laptop>	but you should also have a few of the other versions
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:33:58] <Hipstor__>	for older machines
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:34:07] <kennymc0_laptop>	i have some kubuntu and xubuntu disks
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:34:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	a good mix might be: 10 ubuntu, 3 ubuntu 64bit, 1 alternate install cd
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:34:17] <soldats>	I MUST SAY THAT IF YOU DO MAKE DISKS AND THEY DONT ALL GET USED AT THE INSTALLFEST PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU ARE FREELY CAPABLE TO HAND THEM OUT TO OTHERS AS WELL ITS NOT ONLY TE INSTALL FEST BUT WE CAN PROMOTE AT AL GIVEN TIMES AND WE SHOULD
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:34:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	a few kubuntu
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:34:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: good point
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:34:50] <kennymc0_laptop>	i have about 5 64 bit and even a couple of server disks
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:34:51] <eddieftw>	caps lock attack
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:34:55] <paul928>	xubuntu for resource challenged machines
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:35:06] <DrPppr242>	what are all the disks for?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:35:11] <soldats>	eddieftw: caps lock is cruiose control for cool
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:35:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	i suggest the alternate cd, because in a few cases that's the only thing that will work everytime on some comps
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:35:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	paul928: that's cool too
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:35:34] <soldats>	DrPppr242: the disks aewe live cds
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:35:45] <tyche>	I'll make one or two alternate CD's up, but I've never used them.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:35:49] <soldats>	are live cds ********
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:35:54] <johnc4510-laptop>	we don't want to limit, but we do want to try ubuntu if possible
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:01] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: yes, live
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:09] <DrPppr242>	do you hand them out?
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:09] <johnc4510-laptop>	all except the alternate cd
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:15] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	if you install sure, if they just want one sure
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:30] <tyche>	the disk goes with the installation.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	in other words sure
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:35] <soldats>	johnc4510-laptop: they are all ubuntu so it realy doesnt matter as much but a full gnome/ubuntu is best for a nubie with a good system to try out
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:44] <johnc4510-laptop>	agreed
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:53] <Hipstor__>	i used an alternate cd to install unbuntu on a pentium 1 once.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:36:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	that was the point i was trying to make
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:37:12] <kennymc0_laptop>	i got ubuntu server to run on a pentium 2
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:37:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	i used the alternate only for a long time
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:37:22] <johnc4510-laptop>	but the installer is better now
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:37:34] <johnc4510-laptop>	so alternate not needed as much
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:37:40] <kennymc0_laptop>	it's really intuitive now a windows user could figure it out
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:37:48] <ianmcorvidae>	alternate is still better if you want to do something strange, but that won't be a concern at an installfest.
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:37:50] <soldats>	but we should always try to at lest make a full cd install rather than an alternate it may fray people away
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:37:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	enigmastrat: you here
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:38:11] <johnc4510-laptop>	soldats: true

[Sun May 4 2008] [21:40:46] <enigmastrat>	for people without wireless I guess
[Sun May 4 2008] [21:40:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, we had something about a cart or something to help people bring in equip, ie desktop boxes
