 04:11 <Ron_A> Linux is a complex example of the wisdom of crowds. It's a good example in the sense that it shows you can set people to work in a decentralized way - that is, without anyone really directing their efforts in a particular direction - and still trust that they're going to come up with good answers.

 04:11 <MajB> Passwords are like underwear.  You don't share them,

 04:12 <MajB> you don't hang them on your monitor or under your keyboard,
