The following keyboard operations should be tested. Do not use the mouse in any part of this test.

* Using only keyboard commands, move the focus through all menu bars in the application.
* Confirm that:
** Context sensitive menus display correctly.
** Any functions listed on the toolbar can be performed using the keyboard.
** You can operate every control in the client area of the application and dialog boxes.
** Text and objects within the client area can be selected.
** Any keyboard enhancements or shortcuts are working as designed.
** Any icon or symbol used is usable without the mouse.
