| Audio didn't autodetect, display needs tweaked (stuck at 800x600). Starting fresh from doing lots of debian (servers), so I'll update as I get what works. Has a few USB1.1, On-board sound (surround), ps2 ports, ser/par, game port, and came with a modem.

| ATI drivers have regressed from 8.10 - open source driver works, but has issues. Intermittent hangs during boot file-check. Graphic card doesn't always detect monitor before log-in prompt. Stand-by/Resume hangs. Audio support is more stable than 8.10. USB memory sticks not detected during boot - require unplugging/re-plugging to be detected. This was not an issue in 8.10.

| Only problem was having to change Xorg.conf file, but this may not be required depending on the monitor used. Desktop effects work (with restricted nvidia driver). Tested 32-bit Ubuntu, didn't try 64-Bit. Hibernate/Sleep/Suspend don't work properly.
