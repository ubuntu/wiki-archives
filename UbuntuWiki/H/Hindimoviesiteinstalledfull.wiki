Hi,today i have installed ubuntu 13.x on my new linux server and i have deployed my new website <nowiki>[[http://www.onlinemovies7.com/|movies online free]]</nowiki>.Ubuntu is one of the best OS that can install and use on the fly for my <nowiki>[[http://www.onlinemovies7.com/category/watch-telugu-movies-online/|telugu movies online]]</nowiki> site.
i would suggest every one to use ubuntu,not microsoft or other linux os.i have installed wordpress on my <nowiki>[[http://www.onlinemovies7.com/category/watch-hindi-movies-online/|hindi movies online]]</nowiki>website.
