== Serial ports ==
The Ubuntu Linux kernel comes with serial support compiled in -- this is to support a console on the serial port (the console is required before modules are loaded).  The serial ports on your motherboard will probably be supported by default.  What if you want to hook up more serial devices, however, eg for data logging, to drive a bank of fax modems, or for some other reason?  In that case, you can buy a PCI card and add more serial ports (typically via an external "octopus cable", due to the space restrictions on the back of a PCI slot).  If you have bought one of these expansion cards you may need to change your boot configuration slightly in order for the ports to be recognised by the OS.

For "Dumb" serial cards (if you paid less than about $200, this is probably what you have):
* edit the GRUB configuration file
 <pre>
sudo vi /boot/grub/menu.lst
</pre>
* Look for the section beginning <code> ### BEGIN AUTOMAGIC KERNELS LIST </code>
* Modify the <code> # kopt= </code> line by appending as follows:
** original
  <pre>
}}}
** modified (note: it is still "commented out"!)
  {{{
</pre>
* run grub:
 <pre>
sudo update-grub
</pre>
* Reboot
* You should see the serial ports registered within your <code> /var/log/messages </code> output (or see <code> dmesg </code>):

For Smart serial cards, you may need to install an additional driver.  See the documentation that came with the card.  For more information on the distinction between smart & dumb cards, how to configure the ports now that they are recognised by the OS, and much more useful information, see the <nowiki>[[http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Serial-HOWTO.html|serial HOWTO]]</nowiki>.
