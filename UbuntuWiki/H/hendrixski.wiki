Hi everyone

If you see me on the IRC Channel start a discussion with me, I LOVE those!  These are some topics I'm into:
* Ethics in technology, and the ethical systems that result from open source
* multimedia technology: p2ptv, video RSS, and how people interact with it
* Politics: hint: I can't wait for the US to have a Woman president
* Theoretical Math: It's what I wasted most of my college education on
* Religion: How it applies to our daily lives, how it changes with society and technology
** Fellow Catholics who use Ubuntu: we should chat :-)
* DRM: how it works, why, why not, where it's going, who's doing it, who isn't, etc.
* Travel: I love to travel, to hear stories, share stories, learn new things

Topics I WON'T TALK ABOUT:
* Which editor is better
* Which Distro is better
* Hardware:  I just don't care
* Gaming: it's boring and a waste of time
*
