==== about me ====
I am an English and IT teacher trainee (MA programme) at Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest. I have been using Ubuntu for 4 years and I am an active member of the Hungarian LoCo. As a would-be teacher, I would like to promote the use of free software in education, thus I am responsible for the development of the Hungarian LoCo's e-learning materials.
