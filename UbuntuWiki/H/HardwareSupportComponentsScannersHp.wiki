| HP
| OfficeJet 6310 AllInOne
| hpijs/hpcups
| Yes
| Yes
| v10.04 Lucid v10.10 Maverick v11.04 Natty
| Printing and scanning work over the network. Lucid and Maverick recommend the hpijs driver during printer setup, Natty the hpcups, but both seem to work well. Make sure you install the printer before running xsane. Also, it is best to define a fixed IP address for the all-in-one (you can do this in the HP device web configuration interface).
