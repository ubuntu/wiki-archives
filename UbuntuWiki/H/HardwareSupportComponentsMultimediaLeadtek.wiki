== Details ==

=== Leadtek WinFast TV 2000 XP Expert ===
Ubuntu 5.10 - Problem with sound(clipping,disturbances every 30-40 seconds).

Ubuntu 6.06 - Woks fine

Ubuntu 8.04 - Works fine

=== Leadtek WinFast DTV 1000t ===
Ubuntu 7.10 - Everything except for the remote works off the shelf. To get the remote working, the kernel needs to be recompiled with "Processor type and features -> Timer frequency" set at 1000 HZ and the latest v4l-dvb drivers need to installed (currently not in the repositories). LIRC can then be used with the dev/input driver pointed at /dev/input/eventX.
