The Ubuntu HoustonTeam has no "regular" place for <nowiki>[[../|meetings]]</nowiki>, yet. These are some potential venues.

Stag's Head Pub on Portsmouth near Rice U - went there last night for a meetup and they had free wifi, good beer and a side room that can be reserved for groups.

Other places with beer and free wifi I'm going to check out include:

* Fox and Hound on I-45 South & Fuqua
* Little Woodrows 2301 W. Alabama, 77098
