=== History ===

Start to know Linux since 1998 while working with a Affin Bank Berhad. At that time we used Linux Mandrake (Madriva). I had use to Unix like SVR4 and HP-UX and it's take me in short time to understand Linux.

Most of my community activities in the Internet are with Malay discussion groups. I can trace it back to Penguin @ my.enemy.org 6 August 1999.

=== Ubuntu and Me ===

Ubuntu is the only Linux distrobution that I'm still stuck using until now. I had change many times numbers of Linux Distro from Mandrake, Suse, Fedora and CentOS just to get the kick of it until I've stuck myself with Ubuntu.

It's not easy to get me into Ubuntu because I love using terminal command line and write my things in Vi and then when I'm using Ubuntu, the way Ubuntu work on the Desktop make me fell in love with the Desktop.

I'm using Ubuntu for more than 3 years now. I've also suggest and implement the used of Ubuntu Desktop in OSCC MAMPU. All solution related to office environment in OSCC MAMPU is base on Ubuntu. Every thing is Ubuntu in our office.

My attention is to put our office environment as all out Open Source office example for government agencies in Malaysia. Ubuntu is the key to promote and tools to change the Desktop of each computers in Malaysian Government to used Open Source Software and solutions.

It's harder than it's look, users rejection and attack from vendor but I believe we can do that. We have prove ourself Ubuntu Desktop can work in office environment and we want to duplicate it around Malaysia.

For Ubuntu Community in Malaysia, I'm more into taking care of the OSS communities. Making sure the messages and problems from OSS communities is relay back to the policy maker. It's general in term of scope of work, but Ubuntu community is always my priority due it's the most active OSS community in Malaysia and by assumption the largest installed base Linux Desktop in Malaysia.

Me and my team (RnD OSCC MAMPU) have a bigger agenda. To push Linux Desktop to goverment of Malaysia Computer Desktops. In other words Ubuntu Desktop on each desktop.

<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/fenris|Fenris]]</nowiki> is one of the member RnD OSCC MAMPU and I believe this will create more momentum to archive our agenda. 

Ubuntu-my team already working with MDeC http://www.mscmalaysia.my/ in promoting and making Ubuntu to be used in our coming MSC-OSCON 2009. By making more from Malaysia as Ubuntu Membership, it will be a motivation for them to keep on continue their efforts.

Propose and administration of <nowiki>[[http://mirror.oscc.org.my/|Ubuntu Mirror in OSCC MAMPU]]</nowiki>.

Promote Ubuntu to Government Officers from Talk and seminars by distributing Ubuntu CD's and demo on Ubuntu Desktop.

=== Why I Want to be a member ? ===

It's something not right when a person that push the used of Ubuntu Desktop in Government of Malaysia is not the member of Ubuntu membership. I should have make the effort to update my wiki and attend the meeting.
