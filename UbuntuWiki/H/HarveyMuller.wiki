__TOC__

'''Technology Enthusiast'''

I've built my own hardware.  I don't mean ordering major system parts and plugging them together.  I mean:

* designed PCB board.
* procured the discrete electronic/electrical parts.
* outsourced PCB board production.
* manufactured/fabricated the system.

Now if that sounds impressive, it was ONLY a microprocessor trainer

'''A Linux Enthusiast Since 2003'''

Distributions used/tested in chronological order:

* Mandrake
* Suse
* Gentoo
* Linux From Scratch
* Ubuntu

'''Contacting Me'''

If you really must reach me, my email address is hlmuller AT SYMBOL yahoo DOT com.  I get a lot of email, so make the subject line descriptive and compelling.  If it looks like spam, it gets discarded immediately.
