| The print manager should auto-detect; use the ML-1710 drivers.  Seconded -- I have the same experience.  It's a good printer.  Ubuntu 8.04.3 auto-detects the printer and it works straight away.  Minor settings for page size and word-wrap were only settings changes.  ''''Great!''''

| Auto-detected. Duplex printing works. Samsung provides a Linux driver for this printer, but you can use the FDD file present in the Windows driver (install with Wine or use cabextract) with the default Gnome System>Administration>Printer instead. Also works networked over a router. All the options are available with Ubuntu default printing application.

| ML-1610 not listed but defaults to ML-1650 but this driver does not work, Select ML-1510 driver and printer then works perfectly with no other settings needed. -- update by JanClaeys: I use the ML-1710 driver which seems to work a little better (it fixed a printing problem I had with the ML-1510 driver).

| v7.10 (Gutsy)
| Recognized as the ML-200, ML-210, or ML-4500.  In v7.10 it worked perfectly immediately, out of the box. Older versions: Works well for some, slow (8ppm) for others. Latest MFG's driver is v 2.xx. Installs easily but must still go to System/Admin/Printers and add ML-2010. Tested fine in Dapper. Original driver from Samsung was horrible

| Driver on CD never worked. Used ML-2551N that was pre-installed with Ubuntu. Any of the Samsung PS drivers seem to work. Works from MAC in AppleTalk and from Windows 2000. Had to reset paper size through front panel menu buttons from A4 to letter to clear paper size error. Very fast, inexpensive, and good quality text.
