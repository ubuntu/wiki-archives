=== Summary ===

I live and was born in Norway, now I go to high school, but later I plan to study computer programming. I have some experience with Qt and C++. So I engaged to teach me this in my spare time. And of course I use Ubuntu both at school and at home.

I also help friends and acquaintances with Ubuntu, and try and get many, as family and friends to start using Ubuntu, but this is not always as easy as many are dependent on proprietary software available only for Windows. But I've at least got a lot to run Ubuntu and Windows in "multiboot". When it comes to friends, this has been a little easier, many of my friends use Ubuntu today, and many of them have similar interests as me.

=== My contributions ===

Right now, I translate Ubuntu to nb_NO (Norwegian) and nn_NO. I also bug testing work, and regular testing of the current development branches of Ubuntu.

I would like to contribute more to the Ubuntu project in the future. I hope time can do more specific tasks such as programming and fixing the bugs.
