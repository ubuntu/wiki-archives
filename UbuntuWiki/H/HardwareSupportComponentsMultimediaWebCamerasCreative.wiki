| v7.04 (Feisty)
| The Optia is a USB Video Class (UVC) compliant webcam and is supported by <nowiki>[[http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/|Linux UVC]]</nowiki>. After installation of the latter, and the installation of <nowiki>[[http://ekiga.org/index.php?rub=5&path=ubuntu/feisty_x86|ekiga 2.0.9]]</nowiki>, ekiga recognizes the unit, but the local video display is not continually updated; only the first frame is displayed. Kopete recognizes the Optia but the screen is green. aMSN likewise sees the camera, but I've not yet been able to determine whether it fully works. EasyCam2 does not recognize it.

| 7.10 (Gutsy)
| Supported and fully working out-of-the-box with all applications that I have tried, namely Cheese, Ekiga and Skype. Skype works with default settings, so does Cheese. In Ekiga's Configuration Assistant you need to be sure to select V4L2 (not V4L) as Video Manager. You can also change this by going to Edit->Preferences, expanding Devices and selecting Video Devices; there you should select V4L2 as "Video plugin".
