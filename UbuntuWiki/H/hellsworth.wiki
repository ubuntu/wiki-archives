== Introduction ==

Hi, my name is Heather Ellsworth. I contribute to open source because I highly value the philosophy of social ownership.

My role at Canonical is mostly around the maintenance of snap packages, however I have an interest in Debian packaging as well.

== Community Involvement ==

I contribute to snap maintenance of various packages, usually with a focus on the GNOME snaps.
