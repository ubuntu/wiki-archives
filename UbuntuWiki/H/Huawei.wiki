Hi there!

Here I hope to describe how to connect to the TMN network in Portugal using the Huawei modem and Ubuntu Linux.

I took this instructions from here, no credit at all, just posted it here with minor changes and hosting the files: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=391917

First download the files:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| wget http://student.dei.uc.pt/~jpoa/programs.tar.gz
|}

Connect your huawei e220 usb device and wait a few seconds (let's say 10).

Run the program (don't forget to make it executable ; I assume you are in the same directory as the program huaweiAktBbo-i386.out):
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| sudo ./huaweiAktBbo-i386.out
|}

If you run this command:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ls /dev/ttyUSB*
|}

You should get:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB1 /dev/ttyUSB2
|}

Then you have to send the PIN to your modem with the program comgt (replace 1234 with your pin) don't use sudo here!
(don't forget to make it executable ; I assume you are in the same directory as the program comgt)
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| echo 1234|./comgt -x -d /dev/ttyUSB0
|}

Open the file /etc/wvdial.conf ( ""gksudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf"" ) and put this and only this inside (make a backup of the old one if you want ( ""sudo cp /etc/wvdial.conf /etc/wvdial.conf_bak"" ) ):

[Dialer Defaults]
Phone = *99#
Username = tmn
Password = tmn
Stupid Mode = 1
Dial Command = ATDT

[Dialer pin]
Init1 = AT+CPIN=0731

[Dialer conta]
Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
Baud = 460800
Init2 = AT+CMEE=1
ISDN = 0
Modem Type = Analog Modem

[Dialer 2gonly]
Init4 = AT+COPS=0,0,"tmn",0

[Dialer 3gonly]
Init4 = AT+COPS=0,0,"tmn",2

[Dialer ligacao]
Init5 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet";

[Dialer 384k]
Init6 = AT+CGEQMIN=1,4,64,384,64,384
Init7 = AT+CGEQREQ=1,4,64,384,64,384

[Dialer 144k]
Init6 = AT+CGEQMIN=1,4,64,144,64,144
Init7 = AT+CGEQREQ=1,4,64,144,64,144

[Dialer 64k]
Init6 = AT+CGEQMIN=1,4,64,64,64,64
Init7 = AT+CGEQREQ=1,4,64,64,64,64

Finally run this command;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| sudo /usr/bin/wvdial conta ligacao
|}
