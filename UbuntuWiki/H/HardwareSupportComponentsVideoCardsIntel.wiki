== Hibernate/Suspend issues with xserver-xorg-video-intel ==

As of Feisty, a more up-to-date Intel driver package is available - xserver-xorg-video-intel.

This is a replacement for xserver-xorg-video-i810 and 915resolution, and is now the standard driver in Hardy. Although this offers vastly improved 3D performance, unfortunately this driver is highly unreliable for hibernate/suspend on i965 cards (see <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/164974|bug 164974]]</nowiki>). In particular, resuming from hibernate/suspend will fail most of the time on laptops using the X3100 integrated graphics. This includes the vast majority of low-end laptops on the market in 2008, including those manufactured by Ubuntu hardware partner Dell that have Intel graphics. This requires an upstream fix and will not be fixed in time for Hardy's initial release in April 2008.
