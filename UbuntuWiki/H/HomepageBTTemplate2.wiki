=== About Me ===

I have decided on Ubuntu 10.04 after installing several earlier releases of Ubuntu, Knoppix, Debian, Suse, Fedora and Red Hat. I just did not get it. Now I get it. and I love Ubuntu but wish to work with the LTS to learn more and learn to assist others. I have one friend I am encouraging and will support possibly a second friend. So as I learn I am committed to teaching and assisting them.
