| Everything works except:  To use dual monitors had to install the proprietary nVidia drivers (install was automatic once I told it to, very nice).  Two Samsung SyncMaster 205BWs, had to edit the xorg.conf manually to use the native 1680x1050 resultion of the monitors even though the model was listed and selected. I was using a Linksys RV016 so I had to disable window_scaling:  /etc/sysctl.conf -> net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 0
