I am born in 1983, live in Piliyandala, Sri Lanka and studied at Dharmapala Vidyalaya Pannipitiya. Apart from being a computer freak I like photography and travel anywhere.
I have touched at least 3 program languages. Among them there are Java,vb.net, php.
If you want to contact me, have a look at the Launchpad site provided above. You probably want to contact me via email.
