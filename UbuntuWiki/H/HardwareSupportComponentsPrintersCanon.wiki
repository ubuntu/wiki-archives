| Detected correctly as Canon MP960. You have to fool the computer into thinking it is a PIXMA iP6700. The iP6700 and the MP960 use the same kind of ink cartridges, but the MP960 has a seventh one (PGI-5BK Pigment Black) used for text purpose only. I believe this last cartridge is not used by the driver at all. Printing quality is very good for text. Pictures look a little bit washed out, but you can improve this if you change the default settings offered (brightness, contrast, saturation). Resolution locked to 600x600 DPI (this is a printer with a resolution of 9600 x 2400 DPI).
