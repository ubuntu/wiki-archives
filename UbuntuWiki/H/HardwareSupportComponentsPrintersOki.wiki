| Yes
| v6.10 (Edgy)
| After downloading the .PPD file from http://europe.oki.com/binaryData/6683/ok4200pcl.ppd.gz, install it from the CUPS web interface (http://localhost:631 usually). Works OK. Apparently there is a problem where the printer can block with its error LED flashing - to solve this, set the paper tray to "automatic".

| Prints top of page only. Probably too much data @ 600dpi. Setting @ 150 dpi prints fine but at 1/8 scale.
