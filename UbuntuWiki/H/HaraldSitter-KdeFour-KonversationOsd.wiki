== Konversation's OSD in KDE 4 ==

=== Status quo ===
Konversation is providing an OSD feature (based on Amarok's OSD code) to get most visible notifications for users, which works fine in KDE 3, but not in KDE 4.

==== Issue ====
Due to security reasons Konversation does a DCOP query to kdesktop, whether kscreensaver is active, if this call doesn't get a response, it doesn't turn the OSD on. Since neither DCOP nor KDesktop is running in KDE 4, Konversation can't check the screensaver status and deactivates the OSD completely, which distrubes those who are used to the OSD '''a lot'''.

=== Solutions ===
* Either stick to the deactivation and 
* Deactivate the screensaver activity check in default-settings
* Change the code to work with KDE 4
