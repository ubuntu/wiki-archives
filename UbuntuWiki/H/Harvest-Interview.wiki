These are interview questions to find out usability and conceptual problems with our current approach in <nowiki>[[Harvest]]</nowiki>. We're interested to get <nowiki>[[Harvest]]</nowiki> working with as many use-cases as possible.

* ''What kind of opportunities are you generally looking for?''
* ''Which data is missing in Harvest?''
* ''Is the interface self-explaining enough? If not, what should be clearer?''
* ''Do you find the interface easy to navigate?''
* ''Which feature are you missing in Harvest?''
* ''What made you aware of Harvest?''
* ''Could you imagine hacking on Harvest?''
* ''Have you used the old Harvest in the past?''
** ''If so, are you missing anything in the new Harvest?''
** ''If so, what is the new Harvest doing better?''
