== How was Feisty for you ==

Below are the notes of the first session of UDS Sevilla.

=== Discussion notes ===

Installation problems from the audience:

* intel chipset (915resolution kludge)
* another one with ati (too noisy to hear the details)

Upgrade problems:
* kubuntu problem with depedency error and that made
   X fail (error recovery not good enough)
* kubuntu upgrade ran out of memory when attempting
   to remove packages

Hardware issues:
* ndiswrapper made suspend/resume crash
* regression with some realtek network hardware
* pata problem in feisty (suggestion to provide the old
  modules optionally)

X issues:
* when switching to the console while X is booting, X
  gets confused and sets up no monitor for some people

Compiz:
* mixed response, quite a few people have problems

3rd party:
* automatix, envy still have problems

NetworkManager:
* lots of people use it, still relatively many problems
* bad for static networks (not good integration)

ReleaseProcess:
* freezes are not communicated good enough, various
  ideas like a ReleaseBlog, part of UbuntuWeatherReport
  are discussed
