| "Normal" Suspend/Hibernate
| v5.10 (Breezy)
| PCMCIA slot only works after the following incantation: "setpci -s 0:14.4 subordinate_bus=03".  TV out, Monitor socket, firewire, parallel port, untested. Suspend2 works, with kernel params "resume2=<> noapic irqpoll"

| Hibernate, hot-plugged docking station
| v6.10 (Edgy)
| Couldn't get Hibernate to work on Ubuntu although it works well on WinXP. Suspend eventually worked, but only with KLaptop applet. Docking station worked only if pre-plugged before booting up; it won't work if hot-plugged. Otherwise, everything else worked fine, including WiFi.

== Details ==

==== Toshiba Satellite 1110 (UK Model Z14) ====

* Working:
 Graphics - Monitor and Radeon Mobility M6 LY Graphics Card automatically detected and configured with the correct settings out of the box. VGA out works fine, TV out untested, however I would assume it should work fine also.

 Keyboard - Works fine out of the box. BIOS handled function keys work correctly (brightness, numeric keypad etc.) however other keys will require mapping. I will post details of those at a later date.

 Disk - Works fine

 PCMCIA slots and cards: Work fine

 Ethernet port (wired); Works fine

 Audio: Works fine

 USB: Works fine

 Battery Status: Works fine

 Trackpad: Works fine

* Not Working: Hibernation, Suspend to RAM
* Untested: TV Out, Internal Modem, Parallel Port (should work fine, will test), Serial Port (should work fine, will test), CD-RW (should work fine, will test), CPU Scaling

 Apologies for the untested etc. I'll post an update when I next get chance.

==== Toshiba Satellite 1130 ====
* Fails to load the Feisty (7.04) desktop CD - gets as far as mid-way through Gnome desktop load, you can see the flat Ubuntu/Gnome rectangle, seems to get as far as 'Natilus'. However, it loads the older Dapper (6.06.1) CD just fine.

==== Toshiba Satellite 5205-S703 ====
* Working: keyboard, disk, wireless, network card, audio, USB2, battery status, cd burning, cpu scaling
* Not working: touchpad (uses ALPS synaptics driver not in warty, works perfectly after upgrading to hoary), function keys (works after upgrading to hoary, or, in warty, installing fnfx and adding toshiba_acpi to /etc/modules)
* Not tested: ACPI, firewire, IrDa, video out, SD drive

There are problems with the nv drivers and they only support 640x480 resolution. 1600x1200 works after installing the nvidia drivers.

==== Toshiba Satellite A70-DD100 (A70 series) ====

* Working:  graphics (even automatically set resolution to LCD's native res.), keyboard/mouse, disk, wireless network, battery monitor
* Untested:  external display, wired network (detected, should work fine), CD burner (should work), modem
* Partially working:  Sound
* Not working:  Hibernation, suspend to RAM, reboot, shutdown (reboot and shutdown do NOT turn off the computer, have to hold power button)
* Fn-F6 and F7 work to control LCD brightness (hardware does this it seems).  Fn-F9 to turn off touchpad also works.  None of the other Fn-keys work.

Notes:  Sound card was not detected properly.  To get it working (partially):

add these lines to /etc/hotplug/blacklist
snd-atiixp-modem
snd-atiixp

then add the line "snd-atiixp" to the end of /etc/modules

I also had to do "chmod 777 /dev/dsp" for things to play properly, other wise sound was very weird sounding.

Also, if your keyboard and mouse do not work on first boot, go into the BIOS (F2) and set support for legacy USB devices to disabled.

These have been tested successfully on the A70-S256.

==== Toshiba Tecra 8200 ====

* On first boot during installation hit escape to enter the grub editor and add pci=noacpi to the kernel commandline otherwise you are not able to boot into second the stage of installation.
* After installation add pci=noacpi to the kernel commandline in /boot/grub/menu.lst to fix this permanently.
* The Intel based softmodem driver is loaded before the sond modules, this prevents sound from working.
* To get sound working issue the following command:<pre>
 sudo echo snd-intel8x0m >>  /etc/hotplug/blacklist.d/alsa-base
 }}}
* On next reboot sound will work fine.

==== Toshiba Tecra M2 ====

* For the first boot (installation), used vga=791 to get correct screen resolution for Xorg.

Sound does not work OOB

==== Toshiba satlite 4030 cdt, Ethernet, 5.10 ====
runs fine but need to be edited in xorg to get the resolutoin right and is a bit slow
==== Toshiba A15-S129, Ethernet, 5.04 ====

Installed the machine with 4.10 and everything worked as expected.  Performed an in-place upgrade to 5.04 and the ethernet adapter wouldn't work correctly after rebooting into 5.04.

Steps taken:
# Verified the correct driver was loading - good
# Watched DHCP log on DHCP server to see if traffic was getting out - server good - laptop never set the address
# Set static IP address - good but no traffic
# Verified cable and network switch - good

So, it seems, that the machine can send but not receive traffic.  The only way to get the ethernet card to work regularly was to remove the modem from the laptop completly, then, everything worked.

Would love to find a more "proper" fix for this issue then ripping out hardware.

==== Toshiba Tecra 9000 ====

After install:

'''Network:''' eth0 working on install

lspci lists ethernet controller as:
{{{
Ethernet controller:
</pre>

==== Toshiba Tecra A8 ====

* installs and works fine with Dapper and any later release
* suffers from the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/63418|soft-lockup bug]]</nowiki> in relation to the ipw3945 wlan chipset
* BIOS should be upgraded to at least Version 3.30 to remove the nasty "APIC error on CPU#" filling up the kernel log
* HT should be enabled in grub
* VT is supported but disabled by default (BIOS)

==== Toshiba Qosmio G30 -116 ====

* Working:
 Graphics - Monitor Graphics Card automatically detected and configured with the correct settings out of the box. , TV out untested.

 Keyboard - Works fine out of the box. 

 Disks - Works fine

 PCMCIA slots and cards: Untested

 Ethernet port (wired); Works fine

 WiFi Detected; not tested yet.

 Audio: Works fine

 USB: Works fine

 Battery Status: Works fine

 SD Card reader worked after suggestion CD card fixes.

 Trackpad: Works fine
* To test
  Bluetooth

* Not Working: Hibernation, Suspend to RAM, seem to hang
 
* Problems
 Machines uses an unsupported conexant CX23418 chip for video functions, therefore no video support.
 Lots of error messages in dmesg about CPUs, currently assumed to a CPU scaling issue.
 

 Will post an update when I finsh the WiFi configuration.
