__TOC__


== Status quo ==
In KDE 3 we use a home made application called KDESudo, which enables proper sudo usage for root authentification. KDESu in 4 however does an equal good job with sudo.

== Proposal ==
Instead of reinventing the wheel (i.e. port KDESudo to KDE 4) we should help KDE improve KDESu's sudo support for KDE 4.1. This would probably only be resolving some issue and adding the application icon to the password dialog.
