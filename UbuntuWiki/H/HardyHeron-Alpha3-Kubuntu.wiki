== Introduction ==
On August 29th, 2007, Jono Bacon announced the next release, version 8.04, codenamed the Hardy Heron, on the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-August/000336.html|Ubuntu Developer Announce mailing list]]</nowiki>.

It was recently <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kubuntu-devel/2007-December/002066.html|announced]]</nowiki> that Kubuntu 8.04 will not be an LTS release.  Due to this news, the goals for the release have been revised, with more effort focused on the newly released KDE 4.0.  Kubuntu Hardy will now ship two CDs: one with KDE 3.5, supported for the standard 18 months, and one with KDE 4.0, supported by the community for 6 months.  Users upgrading from Kubuntu Gutsy will get the KDE 3.5 desktop.

The focus for 8.04 with KDE 3.5 for the Kubuntu community will be stability. Following the stability portion of our goals, the Kubuntu developers plan on implementing a new strategy which will allow Kubuntu to catch-up with some of the functionality of Ubuntu. For the KDE 4 version, the goal is to create a usable KDE 4.0 distribution, with some KDE 3 applications to fill in the holes where parts are missing from KDE 4.0.

Alpha 3, the third in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Hardy development cycle, represent the very latest snapshots of Hardy. The pre-release images are known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs, however they are not recommended for use in stable environments. These releases will be for those who are developing, documenting, and testing. Alpha releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://se.cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/hardy/alpha-3/
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/hardy/alpha-3/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release version of Hardy are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Hardy '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

== New In Alpha 3 ==
Hardy Heron Alpha 3 CD release brings with it many updated, new, and exciting applications. For this latest release of Kubuntu 8.04, the usability standards have improved and there have already been some aesthetic changes.

With every new pre-release, updates will be documented allowing you to thoroughly test your Kubuntu 8.04 installation.
