== Ubuntu Wiki ==

Welcome to the Ubuntu wiki! The wiki is open to all to edit, except for spammers. To mitigate this problem, there are a few simple requirements to become an editor:

# <nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/NewAccount | Create a Launchpad account]]</nowiki>
# <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wiki-editors/+join | Join the ubuntu-wiki-editors team on Launchpad]]</nowiki>
# <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/?action=login | Login to the wiki]]</nowiki> and when you do, make sure the checkbox showing your ubuntu-wiki-editors membership is checked
# Edit freely!

== MoinMoin ==

We use MoinMoin software to run our wiki at present.

If you would like a quick overview of MoinMoin's syntax, have a look at HelpOnMoinWikiSyntax. If you are looking for something for a presentation, look at WikiCourse.

* HelpForUsers - is help for users who are new to a MoinMoin wiki.
* HelpOnAdministration - how to configure and maintain a MoinMoin wiki
* HelpIndex - is a list of all available help pages.

(!) Fulltext search is available on FindPage.

----
~-''If you find any errors on the help pages, please describe them on MoinMoin:HelpErrata. Please do not edit or create help pages in other wikis than Moin''''''Master (see MoinMaster:HelpContents), because the pages from Moin''''''Master will overwrite any other changes on wiki engine upgrades. Please follow the established structure of help pages if you want to change pages in Moin''''''Master. Before doing any major or widespread changes please discuss that on the mailing list or Moin''''''Moin wiki.''-~
