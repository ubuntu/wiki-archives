=== Introduction ===

This page should give some information you need about running Ubuntu on a '''Dell XPS 15 L502x''' laptop (the ones with sandy bridge cpu's).

For the L521X, see this page: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Laptops/Dell/XPS/L521X]]</nowiki>

=== Installation gotcha's ===

* USB installation: booting from the USB3 slots won't work. Use the e-SATA slot instead!

=== Hardware ===
==== Optimus / Graphics cards ====
'''Switch off NVIDIA card'''

'''Switch on NVIDIA card'''

Using the following command before and after the switch, you should see a drop/rise in mW being used:

You can also '''completely disable the NVIDIA card''' and only use the Intel onboard graphics card ( which has more than enough performance for day-to-day work:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| # echo "blacklist nouveau" > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia.conf
|-
| # update-initramfs -c -k all
|-
| # reboot
|}

If you prefer there is the bumblebee project that is currently supporting the optimus devices, especially the xps 15.

Here you can find Bumblebee:

https://launchpad.net/~mj-casalogic/+archive/bumblebee/
or even better:
https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee

Bumblebee allows to run applications with nvidia card:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| optirun application
|}

If you want to tweak nvidia propietary driver run
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| optirun nvidia-settings -c :8 (Bumblebee default screen is 8)
|}

==== 9-in-1 card reader ====

In 11.10, to enable insert the card and run:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan
|}
keep informed about this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/703180

==== Trackpad ====

Full multi-gesture (2 points) trackpad usage work at this moment.

==== Top right keys ====
The special touch keys are strangely mapped by default. One changes brightness, one does next track. They seem to be linked to the same key sequences as the Fn+F# keys that do the same job. To fix this, create the keymap file as /lib/udev/keymaps/dell-xps-l502x:
<pre>
0x85 prog1 # Second touch key
0x84 media # Third touch key
</pre>

you can test it works with: 
<pre>
/usr/lib/udev/keymap input/event4 /lib/udev/keymaps/dell-xps-l502x
</pre>
Note that "input/event4" comes from executing: 
<pre>
sudo /lib/udev/findkeyboards
</pre>

To add this rule permanently add in /etc/udev/rules.d/99-l502x-keys.rules :
<pre>
SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event4", RUN+="keymap $name dell-xps-l502x"
</pre>
