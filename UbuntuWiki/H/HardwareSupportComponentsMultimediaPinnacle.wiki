=== Pinnacle PCTV USB2 ===
STILL NOT WORKING WELL DON'T BUY YET
This device has been tested with italian parameters (see other documentation to find out your country number e.g italian is 38 and type e.g. italian is pal), ubuntu Dapper flight 4 and the newest kernel provided by the distro.
There are some steps to follow for getting this device work:
 1. apt-get install xawtv mplayer sox

 2. Create the new file /dev/modprobe.d/tv  and fill it with this text:

     alias char-major-81 videodev
     alias char-major-81-0 tveeprom
     alias char-major-81-1 em28xx
    options em28xx tuner=38
    options tuner secam=d pal=d
    options tda9887 port2=0

 3. Type cat /proc/asound/cards and check if your PCTV is listed and which is its number in the list
 4. Type v4lctl setattr mute 0
     Type sox -t ossdsp -r 48000 -b -c 2 /dev/dspx -t ossdsp /dev/dspy
        Or
     Some tests can be done also typing:
     cat /dev/dspx > /dev/dspy

Where you have to replace dspx with the usbaudio device number that you've found in the list before and dspy is the soundcard dsp
          device
          (I've tried this sox -t ossdsp -r 48000 -b -c 2 /dev/dsp1 -t ossdsp /dev/dsp and it works well)

     Type mplayer -tv driver=v4l2:outfmt=yuy2:noaudio:immediatemode=0 tv://
