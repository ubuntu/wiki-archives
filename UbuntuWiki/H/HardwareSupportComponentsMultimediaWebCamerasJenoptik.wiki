| By default, the '''spca5xx''' driver is used for this camera, but for some reason causes a kernel panic. Using the '''gspca''' driver (not included with Ubuntu, must be downloaded from http://mxhaard.free.fr/download.html and compiled), this problem does not occur any more. Though you must unload the '''spca5xx''' driver after you plug in the camera & then manually load the '''gspca''' driver.
