__TOC__

* HaraldSitter/KdeFour/Apps4For3 (high priority)
* HaraldSitter/KdeFour/Apps3For4 (probably unsolvable issue, which gets improved by the /Apps4For3 propsal)

* HaraldSitter/KdeFour/DotKde (explaining the difficulties of 2 configuration sets)
* HaraldSitter/KdeFour/MigrationWizard (highest priority ever, plz read /DotKde first)

* HaraldSitter/KdeFour/KdeSudo (opinion)

=== The Usual Bits ===
* Application porting status: http://techbase.kde.org/Schedules/KDE4/Application_Porting_Status
* When to drop the -kde4 suffixes?
** What to do with the KDE 3 versions? Drop them? Add an -kde3 suffix?
* Maybe we should mark upstream KDE 4 bugs, so we can differ them from our bugs (add [KDE 4] to the name, and tag as kde4)?

=== Resolved ===
* HaraldSitter/KdeFour/KonversationOsd - the check his been deactivated in upstream source, will do the very same in our package
