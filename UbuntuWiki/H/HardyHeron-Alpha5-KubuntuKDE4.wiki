== In This Release ==

This is our first alpha for our KDE 4 version of Kubuntu.  It comes with KDE 4.0.1 and some applications from KDE 3 to fill in any gaps.  As with any first alpha there remains much polishing to be done (you will need to run knetworkmanager manually for example) but it gives a good overview of what will be released with as 8.04 in April.
