== Introduction ==
Welcome to the HoustonTeam wiki. This the collaboration place for users in the greater Houston, Texas area to find information on local events and resources.  We are in the process of organizing the team and invite anyone in the area to join us.

== Contact ==

For more information on this team feel free to contact <nowiki>[[Justin_Giardina|Justin Giardina]]</nowiki> at <code>jgiardina_AT_gmailDOTcom</code> or <nowiki>[[BelindaLopez|Belinda Lopez]]</nowiki> at <code>dinda_AT_ubuntuDOTcom</code>.

We have a small IRC channel <code>#ubuntu-houston</code> on the freenode IRC network (<code>irc.freenode.net</code>).  In the future, we may want to schedule a monthly IRC meeting.

Our current mailing list is located at http://groups.google.com/group/ubuntu-houston-team.

== How to Contribute ==
We are a team with many helpers and no leaders!   If you are interested in helping to organize meetings/events/other please join the mailing list and try to make it to a monthly meeting.  Personally, I would love to see someone help organize an installfest but we could also use someone to help market the group and help get out meeting announcements in the local press, flyers made and posted around town.

* Team Logo - We agreed, during the April 18th meeting, that JohnLittle's logo will be adopted for our team.

== Projects ==
Lee is working on a Hardware Testing event at Directron, a local computer supply store in the Harwin area.

== Meetings ==
For meeting times and location please visit us at our Google group or Facebook pages.
