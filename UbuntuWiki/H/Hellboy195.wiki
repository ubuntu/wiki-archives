=== About me ===

My name is Stefan Ebner and I live in Vienna.
I have been using linux for two years now and I have tried a lot of different distros like
debian, fedora, mandriva, suse but a friend talked me about Ubuntu and after a little bit of help from him I got it working. I discovered that Ubuntu was really the best distro of all.
