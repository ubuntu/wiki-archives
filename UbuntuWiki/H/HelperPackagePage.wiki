=== Summary ===
Provide an (external?) resource for more full and explicit package information than currently possible by apt-*, dpkg* and friends.

=== Rationale ===
A package description can be quite generic. Sometimes all you need is social help for finding the right package or software to do the job.

=== Use cases ===
Alfie wants to know what the best photo processing/image manipulation program is. After much head-scratching and FAQ searching he figures out to type '''apt-cache search image''' which returnes 780 hits, which is way too much for poor little Alfie. '''apt-cache search paint''' returns too little with no obvious candidate. Even when Alfie tries '''apt-cache search photo''' he gets 87 hits, which is still slightly too confusing.

=== Scope ===
* Create a wiki or similarily community-based site which is dedicated to being very friendly and helpful specific to Ubuntu Linux.
* Primarily providing "the best/most commonly used" photo/image application. Useful tips for getting the most out of that application, and similar tricks&treats.

=== Design ===
The best design would be basing it on the colour scheme of Ubuntu, and creating a domain as well as a custom skin for a wiki or similar community software.
A totally different route would be to go full out AJAX, with something like <nowiki>[[http://turbogears.org|TurboGears]]</nowiki>

=== Implementation ===
To be discussed.
PS: I'd be more than happy to not only be the main lead for this, but also provide hosting!
