=== Peoples comments on my Ubuntu member application ===
Feel free to edit my wikipage and put your comment here.

Mr. ElJacifi forced`^H^H^H^H^H^H` convinced us to use Ubuntu on our corporate servers. We are now very happy with the result. <nowiki>[[http://www.ispman.net/|(Atif Ghaffar.)]]</nowiki>

Hassan is a very nice and helpful guy. No matter which problems occur with my 3 ubuntu machines he came up fast with good, reliable and secure solutions. If he cannot give a solution immediately he tries and tries and tries until he succeeds. And last but not least he is always happy to discuss any imaginable setup or strategy. I am glad to have him around here ;-)
(Jørgen Recke)

Hassan is very active on the Swisslinux.org forums (moderation) and wiki, with many contributions to help people with GNU/Linux. He asked the administrator to open the Ubuntu subforum in 2004. <nowiki>[[http://www.swisslinux.org|(Calimarno for Swisslinux.org)]]</nowiki>

I'm proud to know this guy! It's great to work with him. <nowiki>[[http://www.marcelbest.com/|(Marcel Best)]]</nowiki>

Hassan is a very effective ubuntu evangelist. The day he received the ubuntu cds my laptop partitions crashed. 
And there was no way to recover it with commercial tools (Microsoft, Dell, Partition Magic,..).
But Hassan could put it back to work in a few minutes with a ubuntu cd. That's convincing. :) (Matthieu G.)

Hassan is publishing on Ubuntu-fr Planet since several months. His articles are interesting and pertinent. He is always participating in internal discussions in order to give his feelings, his thoughts, which is, according to me, really important.
That is a real pleasur to work with him. 
<nowiki>[[http://www.szdavid.com/|(Szdavid, Ubuntu-fr Planet administrator)]]</nowiki>

As Hassan is one of my colleague, we have to join our energy together in order to realize our job as well as possible. So I can affirm that this guy is strongly effective and find always solutions with each problem... But above all, Hassan is an human with a big sense of values like respect, honesty and humility.
