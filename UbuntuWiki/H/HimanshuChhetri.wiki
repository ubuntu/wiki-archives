== About ==

My name is Himanshu Chhetri. I am a 22 year old Computer Science major in college(Undergraduate) and originally from Nepal but currently in the United States.

I am interested in fully utilizing the potential of free and open source software for my daily and professional needs. I have experimented with various flavors of Linux but find Ubuntu suitable as my one and only Operating System on my laptop. I use it for everything from programming to word processing.

I go by the nickname 'r11t' on freenode.

== Involvement ==

I am currently a member of two Ubuntu LoCo teams :

* Member of LouisianaTeam (Ubuntu Louisiana) : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LouisianaTeam/
* Member of NepalTeam (Ubuntu Nepal) : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NepalTeam/

=== Goals ===

* Become actively involved in the LoCo teams that I am currently a member of.
* Understand packaging for Ubuntu.
* Contribute towards an existing open source project or start one.
