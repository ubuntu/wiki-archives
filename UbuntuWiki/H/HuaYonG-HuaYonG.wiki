== Personal Profile ==
The first 20years in the 21st century is sure to see the great Communism movement for which Marx had depicted and dreamed in the 19th century in the software field.And I am so lucky to be one of the prophets(i.e. the contributors).I'm full of energy and greatly interested in the spreading of the system and ideologically the idea of the Liberalism that the Open Source or Free Software Foundation firmly conveys.
