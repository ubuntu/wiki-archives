=== My goals ===
==== To Do ====
* Make <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~spreadubuntu|SpreadUbuntu]]</nowiki> the main site for community marketing by the release of 12.04 '''Work In Progress''' We do have a well tested site running right now. See it <nowiki>[[http://spreadubuntu.neomenlo.org/|here]]</nowiki>'''
** Delivering Marketing material Kits
** Integration with the Ubuntu LoCo Directory
* Grow participation of Ubuntu users in the activities of our LoCo
* Coordinate activities with other LoCo teams (specially within Ubuntu Nordic, but also beyond) to promote Ubuntu worldwide in a fun and uniformed way

==== Achieved ====
* My first goal is to achieve approval for Ubuntu Ecuador ASAP. '''Achieved'''
* A goal far down 2009 is to lead the Ubuntu Ecuador LoCo to be a model for viability within the Spanish Speaking community in terms of how cooperation within the community of users, Ubuntu support providers and the enterprise in Ecuador can be done while keeping our transparency and credibility as a Free Software advocacy group. We take Ubuntu as our origo, but we are open to and cooperate with the wider FLOSS community in the country. '''Well under way''' but as I have substracted myself from most of Ubuntu-ec activities I can'æt really longer use this as a goal for me.
* A goal for my participation whithin Ubuntu globally is that we should always move towards the Gobuntu direction for the whole project, and I want to show that it is posible, but that it takes time, patience and a LOT of HARD work! I have used GNU/Linux for 10 years on my desktop... We have come a long way, but have a long way ahead of us. '''Needs to be better defined''' since the whole Gobuntu thingy was dumped.
* Personally I am all in for endorsing commercially backed support locally but make it explicit that the Community efforts come ahead of commercial interest in '''any''' case the LoCo members are involved. Building a good and lasting relationship with the enterprise in Ecuador is a very important goal for me and Ubuntu-EC, but the relationship with the wider community comes first. Even if these two aims rarely collide, and do rather strengthen the position of FLOSS, it is important to know what comes first if there are things that arise within the community and enforce its use when neccesary. '''Pragmatism rules!''' and this I really mean. See above.
* Implementation of OpenID access in the whole Ubuntu-ec infrastructure (using Launchpad as provider), showing that it is possible and be a helping resource with the implementation of it in the Ubuntu-es infrastructure. '''Done for Ubuntu-ec, Ubuntu-no and SpreadUbuntu'''
* Get a working demo of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~spreadubuntu|SpreadUbuntu]]</nowiki> site by the release of Intrepid '''Done, we have had a site up and running since the fall of 2008.'''
* Work more and evenly over time with bugs triaging and LP answer system '''Not achieved''' - reality always gets in your face and shows you that your contributions are better off elsewhere.

=== Trivia ===
* At a age of 2 my daughter was able to recognize what she calls: "el ubuntu" (on a monitor, bag, sticker, CD, coffee cup... you name it).
* I ended up in 3 meetings while vacationing in Ecuador the summer of 2007: One at an International School (wanted to try Edubuntu), one at one of the biggest <nowiki>[[http://www.elcomercio.com|newspapers]]</nowiki> in the country and at the Ecuadorian presidency. These meetings where undoubtedly the final motivation for me to start the Ecuador LoCo, so MauLuna and I did days after the meeting. This happened:
** School: I have tried to find out what happened there, but with no luck :(
** Newspaper: They had load trouble in their web server. Incoming connections peaks with their IIS setup put the server down to its knees and it eventually collapsed. So MauLuna (ubuntu-ec co-founder) and I proposed to them to put Ubuntu as the front webserver and run the IIS in the back serving the content. They said they would consider it, but wanted to use RedHat (as they had in their spamfilter ;). In the end we never heard from them, but they ended up implemented our idea. Which is a victory for <nowiki>[[http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph?site=www.elcomercio.com|Free Software]]</nowiki> and a step closer to fix <nowiki>[[http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph?site=www2.elcomercio.com|bug #1]]</nowiki>. Pretty cool I think!
** Presidency: I met two key persons in of the Ecuadorian Free Software movement in this meeting: <nowiki>[[http://rafael.bonifaz.ec/blog/|Rafael Bonifaz]]</nowiki> former president of ASLE (Ecuadorian free Software Association) and now working as Free Software Director in the newly created Bureau for IT and <nowiki>[[http://www.estebanmendieta.com/blog/|Esteban Mendieta]]</nowiki> IT adviser in the presidency. They both organized the meeting between <nowiki>[[http://www.stallman.org/#serious|Richard M. Stallman]]</nowiki> and Ecuador's president <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpruk8L0Us|Rafael Correa]]</nowiki> which lead to <nowiki>[[http://www.fabianrodriguez.com/blog/archives/2008/04/11/software-libre-en-ecuador/|his endorsement of Free Software]]</nowiki> by <nowiki>[[http://ia360931.us.archive.org/0/items/decreto/Decreto_1014_software_libre_Ecuador.pdf|law]]</nowiki>. Esteban is part of the team <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~estebandid0|formally]]</nowiki>, Rafael is not, but as far as I know he uses some *buntu flavor (probably Gobuntu).
* I was introduced to Ubuntu by a guy who walked in the <nowiki>[[http://www.mobildata.no/forhandlere.aspx?id=1721&page=3&mid=1053&fylke=1126|store where I worked]]</nowiki> and wanted to buy a <nowiki>[[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,104414/article.html|laptop]]</nowiki>. So we started talking about what he need it for and stuff and eventually he named Linux so we went on and I mentioned that I used Fedora Core (or something) at the moment, but upgrading to a newer release was such a pain (it was!), and then he said: "I have discovered this new distro, it even beats debian! But I prefer BlackBox over the GNOME standard". What happened? I got too interested in the issue (he even begged me to just do the sales job, he really wanted to be spontaneous) and no Laptop was sold... In exchange I got the love of Ubuntu! ;) So if you are that guy: Thank you man! If you are my former boss, sorry... ;)
* After I started studying I have found out that I use weekly (at least) 15 hours on Ubuntu related stuff comprehending reading, translating, writing e-mail, wiki edition, forum help, websites mainteinance, blogging about Ubuntu, helping (or getting help) in Ubuntu related irc channels, testing and advocating among other activities. I was really shocked to find out that one week I used over 40 hours!!?? - I have stopped counting... 
* I got a job interview offering at FAST, just by talking to a guy (a Senior Recruitment Consultant) at a bar. I do not think I'm qualified for the job, but that's not the point; the point is that it was the Ubuntu @ FAST conversation that got me his card. Now that Microsoft is in the process of buying the company I do not think I will make that call anyway.
* I went to the Galapagos Islands (yes, they are in Ecuador) last year and went to the Isabela island to see penguins! I did take a movie with a penguin and me while wearing my <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.no/tskjorte|Ubuntu t-shirt]]</nowiki> (Thanks Karianne for the t-shirt! ;). The movie can be seen here: <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJkbqLJPX1Y#|high quality]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJkbqLJPX1Y|low quality]]</nowiki>. I have a related Tux posts <nowiki>[[http://hubuntu.blogspot.com/2008/05/ubuntux-worldwide.html|here]]</nowiki>.
* I once wrote a letter to RMS about the participation of Ubuntu Ecuador whitin a series of seminars he gave in Ecuador.
** I asked: '''I want to ask you if it is posibble for us to give a talk in Quito, Cuenca and Loja?''' - he replied:
** <pre>
I cannot disregard the ethical shortcomings of Ubuntu... Therefore, you may not give speeches about Ubuntu in association with my speeches... To permit this would be to endorse the non-free software in Ubuntu.
</pre>
** and then I asked  '''What will it take for us to get a positive answer from you?''' - and he replied:
** <pre>
When Ubuntu changes its conduct, I will treat it differently according to its conduct.
</pre>
** So yeah, I sort of agree with him, but I believe that making that happen can only be done working from within Ubuntu and its community, not by just waiting until is done or forking the base. This proves a point I think: '''We all are Ubuntu and the world see us not apart from the software but the software as part of Ubuntu as a community, even RMS!''' which I think is great and gives testimony of the great work Canonical AND the community, in all of its instances, have being doing the last few years.
** RMS did suggest using gNewSense, so for those of you wanting his approval <nowiki>[[http://www.gnewsense.org/Mirrors/Mirrors|get it here]]</nowiki> and those of you wanting totally free up-to-date software <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/gobuntu|get it here]]</nowiki>. Both are Ubuntu based ;)

* When I travel (either with work or vacations) I meet with Ubuntu and FLOSS people as much as I can. This far I have met people in:
** Quito, Ecuador (Ubuntu-EC, ASLE and way too many great people to list them al here)
** Valencia, Spain (JuanJo I am thinking of you)
** Skanderborg/Århus, Denmark (yes, even at a Smukfest you can still do the geek-thing over a beer or two)
** Copenhagen, Denmark (I just love the Ubuntu-DK people. I've been received by them twice! Looking forward to the third time already!)
** Barcelona, Catalunya (the Catalan team is just awesome! And remember: Spain is NOT Catalunya!)
** Reykjavik, Iceland (This team will always have a special place in my heart as I helped starting it myself)
** Paris, France (Lots of FLOSS lovers here and there)
** While travelling I met a girl and she was like: '''You mean that you can go around and meet people just like that. Like the masons?''' and I was like: '''Well. not quite like the masons, but yes we meet and talk. But relax, we are not taking over the world… At least not yet! ;-)'''
* Just for the record: I use the main Ubuntu flavour with full codecs support and universe, restricted, multiverse and the Canonical commercial, google and other repositories activated. I want to get my job done, simple as that! That doesn't mean that I do not work for a day in which only main and universe are activated, but we have to make it viable for ourselves till we get there. no excuse, just a mere fact!

=== Comments ===
* Hubuntu is a major contributor to the Spanish-speakers Ubuntu community. He has worked hard to strengthen relations between the Spanish-speaking LoCo Teams. He is actively involved in community projects such as the creation of http://doc.ubuntu-es.org (a great site of Spanish documentation for all the community), the Spanish translation of Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter, and organizing LoCos Team members. He has been an important member in the project to create a large Spanish-speakers community integrated by all the LoCo teams, avoiding duplicate work in our communities, and strengthening the relationship and good communication between them. Also, he actually works on the integration of the different Spanish sites, finding to improve the experience of the user, that actually has a different login for launchpad, doc.ubuntu-es.org, ubuntu-es.org and their specific Local Team web site. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kelp|kelp]]</nowiki>

* Ruben has contributed tremendously to the Spanish speaking Ubuntu community, and is long over due as an Ubuntu Member. He has my full support  :) MartinAlbisetti

* Ruben has rapidly taken a leading role in re-organizing many crucial resources, most notably doc.ubuntu-es.org. He's also been very insistent on banding together several Hispanic LoCos into better collaboration. I fully support his membership. - FabianRodriguez

* Ruben does a superb job with Spanish translation of the UWN. He also keeps us up to date on great events, like FLISOL. - NickAli 

* I am alex, this is cool!!! - <nowiki>[[http://www.alex.conlinux.net/blog/|Alex - member of Ubuntu-ec]]</nowiki>

* Ruben has been contributing to the Norwegian LoCo team by taking part in organizing install-parties, distributing cd's and stickers, and encouraging activities within the LoCo. He has definitely been a resource to help our small team grow in numbers. -KarianneFogHeen

* Ruben is an active contributor in the Spanish speaking Ubuntu community, and the closer relationship between the different LoCo teams, is actively involved in several projects, documentation, translations, talks, Ubuntu-ec .....etc, etc. - <nowiki>[[Meisok]]</nowiki>

* Ruben has been the vital leader to the SpreadUbuntu project for over a year. Even though I do most of the coding and actual work, our project would not succeed with me alone. He is always quick to respond when I need his input on a problem. He does a great job promoting the project, and knows the right offical people to contact. Evan Boldt <nowiki>[[edb82189]]</nowiki>

* Ruben helped kickstarting the icelandic LoCo team and for that I thank him. He's a true beliver in the ubuntu spirit. Ruben get's my full support! - Gardar
