| Brother have released an official driver for this printer - install LPR driver first, then the cupswrapper one. ia32-libs may be required for 64 bit machines. Scanner also works fine using <nowiki>[[http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_scn.html#brscan3|brscan3 driver]]</nowiki>; the driver also needs <nowiki>[[http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_scn1c.html#u9.10|activating]]</nowiki>.

| Used drivers and config <nowiki>[[http://solutions.brother.com/linux/en_us/instruction_prn1a.html|recommendations]]</nowiki> of Brother. Auto-discovered the driver by CUPS (v1.3.x) as a "Brother HL-2170W" (as the recommended driver), instead of the expected HL-2150N. These two related models seem to have the same firmware installed. Smooth printing. Works both at the USB port or with LAN Ethernet. '''Lucid:''' Drivers were installed according to provided <nowiki>[[http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_prn1a.html|instructions]]</nowiki> (additionally: tcsh was installed and /usr/share/cups/model/ was manually created).

| Used drivers and config recommendation of Brother. The printer and driver can also be found by means of CUPS (v1.3.x) all by itself, i.e. it's basically Plug and Play. This particular laserjet is the Wifi enabled cousin of the above mentioned model HL-2150N. Smooth printing. Works both at the USB port or with LAN Ethernet or by means of WiFi. Memory: 32 Mb RAM. More suitable for HQ 1200 dpi printing of large, complex PDF-jobs.

| Using the proper drivers (found at : http://solutions.brother.com/linux/en_us/index.html ), works flawless on USB, Ethernet and WiFi. The only glitch : '''BEWARE''' Duplex printing logic is inversed : If you choose long edge it flips on short edge, if you choose short edge it flips on long edge. If you're going to pool the printer, this might become an issue (As of today, Brother has acknowledged the bug report, might change over time...), if not, quite easy to live with it !!!

Small files can be printed but documents of any significant size such as those created by browsers (Firefox or epiphany) cause the printer to lock up. - EricSJohansson / On the contrary, the printer works perfectly with the hpijs driver, which also supports duplex printing. This is a fantastic printer for Linux users. - ScottGranneman / I have the printer hooked up to the parallel port on my machine. Using printer_port: Parallel Port #1(EPSON) and HL-5170DN-BR-Script3 as the model I am able to get it to work. It has to be Parallel Port #1(EPSON), the other two Parallel port options do not work. -RexHuston
