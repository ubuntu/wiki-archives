__TOC__

==== ABOUT ME ====

* I have used various linux distributions since 2004; Ubuntu has been my preference since Feisty 7.04.
* I have already developed a good grasp of linux systems administration, so I am interested learning more about the linux operating system and gnome in general. I also have a growing interesting Postgresql.
* Helping out with the Ubuntu Bug Squad is my way of showing support and contributing the open source movement, and hopefully i will gain a better understanding of the inner workings of the linux kernel and gnome.
* It is my hope that I will gradually gain the necessary knowledge to contribute bug fixes to Ubuntu, and maybe even become a developer!

==== AREA OF INTEREST ====

Areas of preference:

* Kernel bugs
* Gnome bugs
* Postgresql bugs
* Networking bugs

But at this point in time, I would be happy to triage any bugs to gain experience.
