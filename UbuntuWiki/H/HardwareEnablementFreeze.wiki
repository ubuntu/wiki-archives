__TOC__


At the time of the BetaFreeze and preparation for the Beta milestone, all new hardware enablement tasks for devices targeting the given release should be finished and all the respective packages landed. After this point the release team will not accept any changes into the Ubuntu archives related to supporting new image types or platforms.

This is to ensure that any new platforms are already available for testing during the Beta milestone and in the weeks leading to FinalFreeze.
