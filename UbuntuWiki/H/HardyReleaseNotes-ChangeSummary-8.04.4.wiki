__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 8.04.3 and 8.04.4. This summary covers only changes to packages in "main" and "restricted", which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in "universe" and "multiverse". Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu. For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 8.04 LTS that were released up to and including January 20, 2010. The last updates included were USN-889-1 (gzip vulnerabilities) and USN-890-1 (Expat vulnerabilities).
