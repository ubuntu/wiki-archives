== User Interface Discussion ==

=== Rationale ===

* At first backups are - or should be - done regularly. This is why the steps and information required by each backup process should be as less as possible.
* Most users are not familiar with doing backups. It is often hard to know for them which directories and files are important.
* Users that are more familiar with doing backups and own a large file collection need an advanced include and exclude function.

All of these three needs could be satisfied by using profiles or backup types. The main window only contains a list of predefined backup profiles, e.g. "All personal files" or "All personal files excluding movies and music" and a combobox for all possible backup devices. So you only have to choose the backup type, the backup medium and click on the backup button. 
If a user wants to more complex updates he can edit the profiles.
Since the settings of the profiles are in a separated dialog they don't disturb the regular backups.
The default backup profiles can also be fine grained: we could exclude .Trash, thumbnails and temporary files e.g. browser chaches.

=== Backup ===

==== Main Window ====
<nowiki>[[File:main_window.jpg]]</nowiki>

The proflie treeview shows a set of predefinded and custom profiles.

Each profile is listed with its name and the last backup date.

By default we could deliver a profile "Personal files". It would include the users home directory and would exclude temporary files (browser caches, thumbnails, trash...).

The backup device combobox includes the devices provided by hal.
