__TOC__

Wow, this page was horribly outdated... 

Well, I've been using various Unix/Unix-like systems for a few years now, and for the most part have stepped away from only using (K)Ubuntu.

Now, I run Kubuntu as a host to VMWare Server 2.0 on two different boxes running several OSes:
* FreeBSD 6.3-RELEASE
* Windows XP Professional
* Windows Server 2003 eval  (not yet received -- needed for CS classes)
* OpenSolaris 2008.05
* Ubuntu 8.04.1 JeOS
* openSuSe 10.3

My boxes are: 
* Orion:
* * Core2Duo @ 2.2 GHz, 2 GB RAM @ 800 MHz, 500 GB SATA HDD

* Phoenix:
* * Celeron 1.4 GHz, 1.5 GB RAM @ 400 MHz, 120 GB PATA HDD
