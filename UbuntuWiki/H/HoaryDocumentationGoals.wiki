=== Introductions ===

Matt Zimmerman says that the most important issues he seems from his perspective and from the questions he gets from people are:                                             
                                                                                                         
* Providing a set of answers for people that want to help;                                               
* Making sure that when people have ideas, those get written down somewhere. Places these might go (and the types of ideas that are                                       brought up include):
** Feature Goals                                                                                        
** Bounties                                                                                             
** Feature requests                                                                                     
                                                                                                         
Additionally, Bugzilla is overloaded with a number of different uses and a lot of bugs that it is not handling well. These include:
* Bugs;                                                                                                  
* Support requests that look like Bugs;                                                                  
* Feature requests (stuff that needs to be discussed and refined into                                    
  goals);                                                                                                
                                                                                                         
Maybe we need something like enhancement proposals. We don't necessary                                   
want something that is extremely heavyweight (like PEPs in the Python                                    
community). That said, it's not necessarily clear if this is a                                           
Documentation issue.                                                                                     
                                                                                                         
Another goal will be some "welcome to the community sort of                                              
documentation." Sivan Green will be happy to help out with some of                                       
this style of documentation as he has already been working on this.                                      
                                                                                                         
Another goals that we can do is to go through the list of                                                
documentation that we have that is not currently accessible in Yelp                                      
and we need to go through and register this with scrollkeeper so that                                    
it is in the future.                                                                                     
                                                                                                         
Everything that is registered with docbase in Debian, it is either                                       
HTML or Text so we should make sure we actually ship the SGML.  We                                       
should also make sure that we register all the Ubuntu specific                                           
documentation like the about Ubuntu documentation.

The about Ubuntu is a single on-disk HTML page that pops up when you                                     
click on about Ubuntu but this piece of documentation could be                                           
improved. It should be in Yelp as opposed to the in the browser.                                         
                                                                                                         
There are also going to be hints and tips that we'll be using. We                                        
should have an infrastructure where you can have per-version hints and                                   
such.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                         
Upstream branding issues will need to be done upstream in most cases                                     
* basically in GNOME.                                                                                   
                                                                                                         
There's also the Ubuntu pocketbook idea which is to have a printable                                     
document that is also on the machine that has a mini-install guide and                                   
a spread about each application.                                                                         
                                                                                                         
We should try to centralize on Yelp and if we have feature requests                                      
for Yelp, this is the sort of thing that we would like to link to                                        
documentation.                                                                                           
                                                                                                         
Auditing of packages and making sure that we have stuff for every                                        
package.                                                                                                 
As far as the stuff that we need that is specific to Ubuntu. It's                                        
basically up to the group.                                                                               
                                                                                                         
We have a couple major ideas that are goals include:                                                     
                                                                                                         
* The Ubuntu Quick Start Guide (in a Nutshell) (the pocket book)                                         
** The basic install overview                                                                           
** overview of applications                                                                             
** how to join the community                                                                            
** something around ~6000 words + loads of pictures and screenshots                                     
                                                                                                         
  This shoudl be done by week 23 (two weeks before the preview freeze).                                                                                               
                                                                                                         
* The About Ubuntu page should be threshed out and such (this is a small one).                                                                                            
                                                                                                         
* Bringing unofficial documentation into the fold and to start relationships with these people.                                                                       
** evaluate and audit different pieces of documentation                                                 
** bring both people and docs into the Ubuntu fold                                                      
                                                                                                         
Secondary goals include:                                                                                 
                                                                                                         
* manpages with issues with corrections and such                                                         
* corrections made to existing documentation, etc                                                        
* improve work between the GNOME and Ubuntu doc teams
