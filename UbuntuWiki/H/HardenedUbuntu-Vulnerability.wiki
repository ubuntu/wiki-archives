=== Summary ===
This spec places the vulnerability research, patching, and information diffusion aspect of the Ubuntu Security Team as a sub-team of the Ubuntu Hardened Team specified in HardenedUbuntu:  the Ubuntu Hardened Vulnerability Team.

=== Rationale ===
The Ubuntu Hardened Team is made up of multiple sub-teams all approaching security from a different angle using a different set of tasks.  It is important to continue to be mindful of new vulnerabilities; collect or create patches; apply and release fixes; and exchange patches and security concerns with other distributions and upstream.

=== Use cases ===
Any vulnerability in any package needs to be fixed.

=== Scope ===
The scope of the Ubuntu Hardened Vulnerability Team includes the following tasks:

* Monitoring various channels of information for new vulnerabilities.
* Locate patches for new vulnerabilities from these channels, upstream, or other distributions, or the <nowiki>[[HardenedUbuntu/SourceAudit]]</nowiki> Team.
* Apply and release patches to correct vulnerabilities.
* Report vulnerabilities and release USNs.

=== Design ===
A team will be created that follows the above scope.

=== Implementation ===
We have these guys already, they're called the Ubuntu Security Team.
