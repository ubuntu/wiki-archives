| Printing anything with graphics at 300dpi will cause a "20 MEM OVERFLOW" error. This happens unless you have installed an additional memory module. The driver will send the data all at once and not in chunks, which the printer can't handle.. Printing at 150dpi results in really ugly printouts (especially from firefox). The hp4laser supposedly is smart enough to send the data in chunks, but I'm not smart enough to configure it with cups (http://home.mn.rr.com/richardsons/sw/hp4laser/). (MikkoVirkkilä)
