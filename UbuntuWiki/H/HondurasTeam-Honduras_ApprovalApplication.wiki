* Ubuntu Honduras is a great example of a young, energetic and enthusiastic team. Ubuntu-hn has grown, both in membership and in experience in the last months. The team is a vital part of the greater Ubuntu Central American Team, and as such, their input and contributions are most valuable. Giving Ubuntu-hn the status of official team is an acknowledge for all their hard work. - <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~leogg|leogg]]</nowiki> - Ubuntu Nicaragua, Ubuntu Member
* I've been watching the work of this guys for some time, its a really proactive team with some really special members who provide a lot of support to our Ubuntu Central American Team. I think they deserve to be an official team. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DiegoTejera|Diego Tejera]]</nowiki> - Ubuntu Panama
* This is a great team, the guys are working for the Ubuntu mision, our team is very happy for our friend country Honduras, they are doing  events,  we are happy to work with them, and I know  they will be an aproved community. Ubuntu Central American Team will work with Ubuntu-Hn team, because their contributions are very important <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~dkcross|DKcross]]</nowiki> - Ubuntu El Salvador
* Ubuntu-HN has multiplied in membership and events in a difficult context, it's always been pleasant to assist Elvira (initially) and Diego, and watching as they welcome other members in a truly Ubuntu way. The team and its members always seek advice when needed and Diego has stepped up as a valuable lead, setting ambitious goals and getting support from team members and the wider community, but also making sure everyone notices, by sharing. Go Honduras! - FabianRodriguez aka MagicFab - Ubuntu Quebec and former Ubuntu Colombia lead.
* These guys Rock!!! They have been a good example on how to grow a community by taking good care of new comers and politely handling unfriendly people on the IRC. "You will approve them..." (Jedi mind trick) ;) . <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~jalvarezsamayoa|Javier Alvarez (JManGt)]]</nowiki> - Ubuntu Guatemala.
* I met <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DiegoTurcios|Diego Turcios]]</nowiki> and some other members of the Honduran community at <nowiki>[[http://ecsl.sl-centroamerica.org/ | Nicaragua]]</nowiki>. They are full of great ideas and eager to contribute with Ubuntu and free software in general. We formed a work group with all the LoCos from Central America; and Honduras is being an essential part of this effort. Since then, we've been working together sharing our goals, our time and our resources. By approving Honduras you will promote the growth of Ubuntu in all the region. - <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~elopio | Leo Arias]]</nowiki> - <nowiki>[[http://www.crubuntu.org | Ubuntu Costa Rica]]</nowiki>. 
* I met the Ubuntu Honduras Loco Team in San Pedro Sula, when i was attending the LinuxTour San Pedro Sula, the first event of this team, and supported by Ubuntu Nicaragua LoCo Team. We decided to support the team because we saw they want to work and promote Ubuntu in honduras. This team is becoming in a very active community, making an official team of Ubuntu Honduras will give a backup to promote Ubuntu and to contribute the Ubuntu Project. <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~naguilarg|n0rman]]</nowiki> -<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.org.ni/|Ubuntu Nicaragua]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/norm|Ubuntu Member]]</nowiki>
* Ubuntu Honduras team's work is really good. They have been working a lot and I have seen them grow since the beginning. I met part of the team on June in the Encuentro Centroamericano de Software Libre(Centroamerican Free Software Summit) and they had a great participation. Go Honduras!!  <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~aj-fitoria|Adolfo Fitoria]]</nowiki> -<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.org.ni/|Ubuntu Nicaragua]]</nowiki> Team Contact.

* We know what ubuntu Honduras has all this time and with the approval of Ubuntu-hn fortalezera ubuntu Central American community to make bigger, stronger and so able to do more and better projects for our region, Central American! *_*Ahcupidin Ubuntu El Salvador*_*
