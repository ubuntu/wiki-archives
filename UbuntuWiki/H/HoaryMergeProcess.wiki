__TOC__

Notes about how we will bring forward Ubuntu-specific changes from Warty to Hoary:

* Unmodified packages should be automatically imported from sid
* The availability of a new version in sid which requires a merge should trigger a notification event (email?)
* Merges should be distributed to Ubuntu developers for review and action
* We should develop some simple tools to allow easy merges to be mostly automated
* The merge process will require at least the latest common ancestor (from which Ubuntu branched, which we have in the morgue), the sid version, and the current Ubuntu version.
