==== Notes ====

* Installation requires two modifications to succeed.  If using the LIVE CD then the resolution must be changed to 1024 * 768 and then the -noapic parameter must be added. When installation is complete it is not possible to start ubuntu until the following parameters are added, acpic=off pci=noacpi

* Video files are lagging, this is probably due to the failed 3D acceleration. Another test suggests that using apt-get install nvidia-glx would help this.
 
* Sound does not work properly, it is also lagging badly.

* Wireless card does not work. On the front of the computer there is an indicator that should turn blue when the card is working. It is not. The forums suggest that downloading the windows driver and using ndiswrapper could solve this.
