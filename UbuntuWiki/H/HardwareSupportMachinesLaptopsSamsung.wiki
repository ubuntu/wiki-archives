| Breezy
| This laptop is quite old now but Breezy installed just fine.  Runs very slow with the standard RAM but an upgrade sorts this out. No wireless built in but PCMCIA worked right away too and I am successfully using a Draytek 802.11b wireless card.  Haven't tested the built-in modem as I have no use for it. Battery indicator works 95% of the time but I have seen it tell me I am running on battery power sometimes when the laptop is actually plugged in.  It'll popup a message saying you're about to run out of power but nothing happens.  Haven't tested an external monitor.
