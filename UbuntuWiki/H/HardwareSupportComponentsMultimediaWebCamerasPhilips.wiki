| pwc
| Yes
| Yes
| 9.04 Beta
| Autodetected and working. Had to remove my tv card (have not tried to have my tv card inserted now that I use 9.04 Beta), however there might be a way around this. Identified as "0471:0329 Philips". 10 fps default, 15 fps after using setpwc.

| PCVC840K "ToUCam Pro II"
| pwc
| Yes
| Yes
| 
| Autodetected and working correctly. However gnomemeeting fails to detect availability of /dev/video1 (I have a tv card on /dev/video0) and so gnome meeting is unable to use the cam. Camorama works fine. As the pwc driver is working correctly all other webcams supported by pwc should also work. Check <nowiki>[[http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/PWC/WebHome|here]]</nowiki> for a list

| PCVC720K/00 "ToUCam XS"
| ov511
| Yes
| Not out of the box
| 
| This cam uses the ov518 chipset. It is Autodetected but complains that it can't enable compression. Simply adding 'ovcamchip' to /etc/modules so it loads the ovcamchip module resolves this, but the cam still wont work until you download, compile and install the latest Experimental ov511 driver from http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/. (The driver supplied with Ubuntu doesn't seem to have ov518 compatibility yet...)
