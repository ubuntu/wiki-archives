| v5.10 (Breezy)
| This card was added to Linux kernel 2.6.15, hence it will not work out of box in Breezy.  On a Fedora system that had that kernel version, video worked fine, however no audio.  Major changes around Jan 2006 to the saa7134 audio driver (affecting other cards as well) that haven't been polished or applications not updated for the changes may be to blame.

| Aver``Media claim this device is "Linux Compatible" on their website, but their driver is only for a few specific (and old) distributions and will not compile against newer kernels and the pre-packaged kernel drivers only work with specific pre-built kernels.
