Hi everyone, my name's Hassan Williamson (aka HazRPG). I am a programmer by nature, and a web developer by profession.

I'm usually found hanging around the freenode IRC server on the #ubuntu-uk channel, discussing anything that may be happening at the time on the channel.

=== Stuff I have done ===
==== Community ====
* I help out on the #ubuntu-uk IRC channel where possible.
* I try to spread the joys about the open-source community to people I meet, by showing them Ubuntu in action on a LiveUSB I have.
* I also dish out LiveCD's to people who are interested, and even help them install it and get them up and running. Along with pointing them to where they can find more information (forum, irc, mailing list, etc).

==== Personal Projects ====
* I've set up an IPv6 tunnel, with help from other members of the Ubuntu-UK LoCo. I also have a blog page outlining how others can do the same.
* I've setup an IPv6 router advertisement (radvd) server, to assign IPv6 address to my network. Also found on my blog.
* Currently in the process of learning how to setup and configure an Ubuntu Server from scratch, and shall be blogging about my discoveries, problems, and steps I took.

=== Future plans for Ubuntu ===
