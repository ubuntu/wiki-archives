This page lists some of the netbooks that have been tested with Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.04 (or newer, see tests), along with any known quirks or issues experienced during testing.

Note: for best results, take a thumbdrive with a copy of the Ubuntu Netbook Remix with you to the store, plug it in, and test it yourself.  Then update this page :-)

You can also join this new project (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Laptop) doing some simple tests to keep track of regression in the development release, filling out a report of your netbook. :-)

== Tier 1 ==

These are netbooks that work reasonably well, with few or any issues, and no major issues.

=== Acer Aspire 1810T ===

==== Maverick Meerkat (Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition) ====
** Works well for most things, ethernet-port, wireless, sound playback, webcam, USB, suspend, bluetooth, 3G, all working fine.
** internal mic/sound recording only works with gnome-tools
** internal mic with skype:
    Do this once:
*** open skype, and disable '''automatically adjust microphone settings''' in the sound options panel
*** install and run '''padevchooser'''
*** go to '''Volume Control...''' / '''Input Devices'''
*** unlock the '''lock channels''' padlock and pull up the volume for the '''Front Left''' channel (internal mic), pull down the volume for the '''front right''' channel (external mic).
*** klick on the 'Set as fallback'-button (right of the pad lock)

*** Do this every time:
**** have '''pavdevchooser''' running before you start skype

=== Acer Aspire One 150 ===
<nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Aspire_One|Acer Aspire One article on Wikipedia]]</nowiki>

Works well for most things, sound, webcam, ports all reported to work correctly.  Minor problems include pulseaudio interfering with sound recording, and media card reader issues unless it is booted with a card in the slot.  D250 models, on the other hand, have been known to have issues where built-in microphones and ethernet cards do not work unless new drivers and pulseaudio are installed and configured correctly.

Known issues:
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/271019|271019]]</nowiki> - media card reader not hotpluggable on acer aspire one
Edit: This appears to work in karmic

=== Acer Aspire One 250 ===
Works well for most things, sound, webcam, ports all reported to work correctly.  Minor problems include pulseaudio interfering with sound recording, and have been known to have issues where built-in microphones and ethernet cards do not work unless new drivers and pulseaudio are installed and configured correctly.  The key reasons for differentiating the models is that on the 250 wired networking can be an issue, and the card reader is hotpluggable.

Note: For the Acer Aspire One Model ZA3 (Manufactured 2009 - A0751h-1279 - Poulsbo chipset) there are issues with the video driver.  See below.

=== Acer Aspire One 521 ===

==== Maverick Meerkat ====

===== BIOS Version 1.08 =====
Everything works except suspend/hibernation, microphone, sound switching from speakers to headphones, and ACPI detection of battery.
Battery issue (which is an upstream ACPI kernel issue) is resolved by patching kernel with patch offered at <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19602]]</nowiki>.

====== Lubuntu 10.10 & kernel 2.6.38 ======

Fn Keys works, disable of wifi possible, sound switching from speakers to headphones works, microphone works,
the battery detection still does not work.

==== Lucid Lynx ====

===== Model AO521-3530 MFG Date: May 2010 =====

====== BIOS Version 1.0.1 ======

Everything works [sound, webcam, keyboard, trackpad, ACPI buttons] except for the microphone (might be the issue with stereo mentioned on this page) and the battery indicator. The system always detects AC power regardless of the state. I have not tested hibernation/suspend.

====== BIOS Version 1.0.3 and 1.0.6 ======

These BIOS versions cripple the system: neither keyboard or trackpad work. In rescue mode there's an error that flies by too fast, so I am not sure what it is about. I tried booting to stock and updated kernels with various combinations of acpi and apic flags but to no avail. Be advised that BIOS version 1.0.1 is not available for download on Acers' website, so back up the ROM before you attempt testing.

====== BIOS Version 1.0.8 ======

This BIOS version fixes the keyboard and trackpad issues, however the battery detection still does not work. AC adapter detection works. The system is usable.

===== Model AO521-3740 MFG Date: May 2010 =====

====== BIOS Version 1.01 ======

The same issues as mentioned above for the same BIOS version, with the added complication that the wired ethernet driver is not supported automatically. The fix is to follow the steps suggested here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9449490 (response #6 from pytheas22). This works easily as long as you have a wireless connection! The only proviso is that, since you are manually inserting the module into the kernel, after every kernel update, you'll have to repeat the procedure.

===== Model Acer Aspire One AO521-3782 =====

(Lucid Lynx 64 bit desktop version)

The keyboard does not work out of the box. However, Acer provides BIOS update on it's <nowiki>[[http://us.acer.com/acer/service.do?LanguageISOCtxParam=en&miu10einu24.current.attN2B2F2EEF=3750&sp=page15e&ctx2.c2att1=25&miu10ekcond13.attN2B2F2EEF=3750&CountryISOCtxParam=US&ctx1g.c2att92=453&ctx1.att21k=1&CRC=2054404012|support site]]</nowiki>, and it solves the keyboard issue. Everything else works including sound and WiFi. Audio jack does not work. Computer does not turn on after a suspend.

=== Acer Aspire One 522 and 722 ===

See <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne522|AspireOne522]]</nowiki>.

=== Acer Aspire One 532h ===

==== Lucid Lynx ====

Model 532H-2789 MFG Date: January 2010
Touchpad, including edge scrolling, works out of the box. Also tested -- and works -- with Linux Mint 9.
Everything I have tested, including suspend & hibernate, works out of the box. (I have not tested microphone and a few other things.)

Model NAV50 MFG Date: December 2009
Known Issues:

* Touchpad has the same issue as the beta. For edge scrolling, see post 4: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1470975]]</nowiki>
* Microphone doesn't work out of the box. To resolve this issue:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
pavucontrol
</pre>
 Click the "input devices" tab. Click the lock icon to unlock channels. Set the front right channel to silence.
* The (multifuntion) cardreader shows up in lsusb, but doesn´t work per bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/530277|530277]]</nowiki>.
* Fn + F2/F3 wireless/bluetooth on/off hotkeys don't work. They don't show up in dmesg either.
* Mini install CD doesn't work with ehternet and wifi.
* Brightness control hotkeys switch 3 steps up and down instead of one step.

Works well:
* Volume, Sleep and display hotkeys.
* Webcam.
* Display.
* Audio (internal speakers and headphone jack)
* Wireless and Ethernet work, as long as you use a desktop live cd to install Ubuntu.

==== Lucid Lynx Beta ====

Model NAV50 or 532h-2807. MFG Date: Feb. 2010. Wireless: Atheros AR5B95.

Works very well. Webcam and wireless are no problem at all.

Known Issues:
* Touchpad scrolling doesn't work in the latest Beta; neither edge- nor two-finger scrolling. See <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9209315]]</nowiki> for a workaround.
* Touchpad's "disable while typing" also doesn't work. But with a few days of practice it's not much trouble.
* Microphone doesn't work out of the box, but setting PULSE_SERVER to localhost before running an application seems to fix it. I.e.: '''`/bin/sh -c "PULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1 program-name"`''' will launch `program-name` with full microphone support (`program-name` can be `gnome-sound-recorder`, `skype`, etc.).
* Card reader Not found in Ubuntu9.10 also cannot boot from SD at all.
   This is a multifunction card slot per bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/530277|530277]]</nowiki>.
 Note:(In Windows 7:SD Card is listed as a Disk Drive(Combo-Drive) on ENE USB Mass Storage Controler
  >drivers:C:\\Windows\system32\DRIVERS\disk.sys C:\\Windows\system32\drivers\partmgr.sys)
* ethernet port works well

''Not Tested:'' microphone jack, headphone hack.

=== ASRock ION330 ===

'''Note:''' this is a <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nettop|Nettop]]</nowiki> machine (see also <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASRock|ASRock on Wikipedia]]</nowiki>)

Works very well with sound, video all working well. Just use the System/Hardware Drivers app to install the ION graphic driver

Known Issues: None so far!

=== Asus Eee PC 1215N ===

==== Ubuntu Desktop 10.04 Lucid ====
NIC card with Atheros(R) chipset wasn't fully recognized. It's recommended to download module for kernel from <nowiki>[[http://www.opendrivers.com/driver/2117587/atheros-ar8152-ethernet-driver-1.0.1.9-linux-free-download.html|Opendrivers.com]]</nowiki>.

Most things work perfectly right away including wireless.

The odd thing about this netbook is the Nvidia Optimus tech. There is a Intel and Nvidia chipset in this netbook but only the Intel will be used without doing some hacking. DO NOT INSTALL THE RESTRICTED NVIDIA DRIVER. Doing so will enable the Nvidia chipset which will cause the screen to turn off when you enter Gnome. To get the Nvidia chip working you would need to figure out how to install/use vga_switcheroo.

To get console switching to work (ctrl+alt+Fxx) you need to disable KMS as described here <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/KernelModeSetting]]</nowiki>
I disabled it for both the Intel and Nvidia drivers just to be safe but you should only have to disable the Intel.

To get the sound to output from the headphone jack properly install the linux-alsa-driver-modules-(your kernel version) package from the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-audio-dev/+archive/ppa|Ubuntu Audio Dev PPA]]</nowiki>.

=== Asus Eee PC 1215P ===
{{http://gimmy.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/f00c6921a8_47446_b1.jpg?w=250&h=233}}

==== Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 Maverick ====
Most things work perfectly out of the box, including wireless with driver broadcom.
Also Compiz, microphone, webcam, suspend and the Fn key from the keyboard (sound, stop/pause/play, bringhness).

==== Ubuntu 11.04 Natty ====
Works two fingers scrolling and right click with touchpad!

=== Asus Eee 1201N ===

==== Natty ====

Everything works from the stock install but you must do it plugged on the ethernet. Otherwise it fails. You only need to install the proprietary video card driver post installation. The system will suggest doing it after installing.

Microphome works out of the box.

All FN buttons seem to work, except turning the screen off. Haven't tried the screen sharing button, but it's so standard it should work.

==== Ubuntu Desktop 10.04 Lucid ====

The installation of Ubuntu can be done from a USB stick or using an external optical drive. Details of how to create a bootable usb stick can be found on Ubuntu's download page.

Everything works on the Asus Eee PC 1201N in Lucid Lynx aside from a few things which are less important functions.

When you have finished installing Lucid Lynx you need to plug in the netbook via the ethernet port and install the latest updates in order for the wireless to work from the network manager applet. This is easier than trying to enable it on the old kernel. (If you can't do this you may be able to use ndiswrapper to enable wireless temporarily in order to download the updates.)

To get the internal microphone to work you need to install PulseAudio Volume Control (pavc). When installed open it (Applications>Sound & Video) and go to the input devices tab. Deselect the lock icon by clicking it.  Drag the front left slider to about 80% and drag the front right slider to 0%. Now just check it works by going to the Sound Recorder (Applications>Sound & Video).

The only thing that doesn't work is the lock touchpad button. (Left silver button opposite the power button.) This can be enable with some scripting but for now I'd recommend not trying unless you are an advanced user. This is a minimal problem and the netbooks touchpad is positioned perfectly so your hands don't touch the touchpad while typing.

===== Video =====
The open source nVidia drivers that come with Lucid Lynx work well.  If you want 3D however, you may benefit from installing the nVidia closed source drivers.  Open the menu item System > Administration > Hardware Drivers.  The nVidia hardware should be listed in the hardware drivers control panel.  Select Activate to install and automatically configure the new drivers.

You will need to logout of your desktop (or reboot) before the new drivers take effect.

===== HotKeys =====
To get the majority of the hotkeys to function properly, you need to modify how Grub start your Linux, as follow.

Open a terminal and edit your Grub configuration file:
<pre>
sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
</pre>
And change the option row ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"'' as follow:
<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor splash"
</pre>
Then update Grub installation with the command:
<pre>
sudo update-grub
</pre>
and restart your netbook

Working hotkeys include: wireless toggle, brightness (except F7 to switch off screen), volume.

Neither of the disable touchpad keys work.

==== Ubuntu Desktop 9.10 Karmic ====

Most things work out of the box, touchpad, keyboard functions (brightness, volume etc.), wired LAN and Sound. Dedicated touchpad disable button does not work. Using proprietary NVidia driver 195 and video is awesome! With MPlayer and SMPlayer using VDPAU 720p content looks great on the 12.1" display. Have not tried the HDMI yet.

Known Issues: Wireless... Realtek 8192se is not directly supported in Karmic. Lots of reading on the web about NDISWrapper working for some folks with the Win 2000 driver but I used Kernel 2.6.31-14 and Realtek driver rtl8192se_linux_2.6.0010.1116.2009 and have no issues, suspend works and wireless is realiable. Tried newer kernel and newer driver from Realtek but just not reliable. Internal mic does not work shows in sound config and Skype but does not work, still looking for a solution.

Edit: The Realtek wireless driver requires you compile and install to your Kernel version, this means any Kernel updates will require you to recompile (sudo make, sudo make install). So far I have only had success with Kernel 2.6.31-14 Generic. Will update if I find another Kernel that works.

=== Asus Eee 1201HA ===

==== Ubuntu Desktop 10.04 Lucid ====

Most things work out of the box, but you need to resolve those problems:

===== Video =====
The Graphics Video Card is an Intel GMA500.
Please refer to the appropriate page: <nowiki>[[HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsPoulsbo]]</nowiki>

===== HotKeys =====
To get all hotkeys function properly, you need to modify how Grub start your Linux, as follow.

Open a terminal and edit your Grub configuration file:
<pre>
sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
</pre>
And change the option row ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"'' as follow:
<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor splash"
</pre>
Then update Grub installation with the command:
<pre>
sudo update-grub2
</pre>
and restart your netbook

===== Microphone =====
To set properly microphone, you can set those parameters on command line:
<pre>
amixer -c 0 sset "Master" "100%" "cap" "unmute"
amixer -c 0 sset "Headphone" "100%" "cap" "unmute"
amixer -c 0 sset "Speaker" "100%" "cap" "unmute"
amixer -c 0 sset "PCM" "100%" "cap" "unmute"
amixer -c 0 sset "Mic Boost" "0%" "cap" "unmute"
amixer -c 0 sset "Beep" "74%" "cap" "unmute"
amixer -c 0 sset "Capture" "78%" "cap" "unmute"
</pre>

or you can install an advanced graphical mixer:
<pre>
sudo aptitude install pavucontrol
</pre>
and unmute the microphone in the input sheet.

==== Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10 Karmic ====

Most things work out of the box [touchpad, keyboard shortcuts (brightness, volume), Wireless, Sound. Touchpad disable Shortcut doesn't work.

Graphics driver install instructions can be found here:
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsPoulsbo]]</nowiki>

Other Hardware and video performance not tested yet.

=== Asus Eee PC 1015PN ===

==== Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 amd64 ====

The 1015PN is a dualcore Atom Netbook (1.5 GHZ, 2 Gig Ram) with wlan, bluetooth, HDMI & VGA out. In addition to the Intel GMA 3150 this Notebook has a ION2 (GT218) GPU that works great in ubuntu with the proprietary nvidia binary driver.

===== Working =====

* Wireless - working (see fixes)
* Wired network card - working otb
* Webcam - working otb
* Touchpad - working otb
* Hotkeys - working (see fixes)
* Graphics card driver (1024x600) - working with nouveau and/or nvidia binary driver for the GT218 chip or with intel i915 driver for the GMA 3150 (see Graphics Chips section below)
* Audio - working (alsa update needed, see fixes)
* Microphone - working (alsa update needed, see fixes)
* Mic-in and audio-out jack (alsa update needed, see fixes)
* Multi-touch - working (see fixes to enable 2 finger scrolling)
* Power managment (sleep & hibernate) - working otb
* SD Card reader - working otb

===== Not Working =====

* Bluetooth chip: works sometimes but not stable. Updating the Bios to 0401 makes it a bit better but its not fixed for now.
* Hardware button left top (Power mode & online mode switch)
* VGA Graphics Hot-switching: The VGA chipset in this Netbook comes with a Intel GMA 3150 built into the N550 CPU and a Nvidia ION (GT 218) chip. Both cards can be used in Linux but the "Optimus" hot-switching between the two chips is currently out of reach due to a bug in the intel i915 driver. (module unload is currently disabled on kernel level due to memory leaks)

===== Fixes =====

* Wlan: The Broadcom (BCM4313) Chip requires the proprietary "Broadcom STA wireless driver". Connect via lan, run a system update and install the driver via the Restricted Drivers Manager.
* Hotkeys: Volume, Sleep and display brightness need the asus fixes

         apm = 254
         apm_battery = 254
 }
 }}}

===== Graphics Chips =====

As noted above both VGA Chips can be used in Linux. The Nvidia Chip is useful for high performance stuff (like Gaming, HDTV, ect) but draws a lot of power from the battery. For basic operation I find the Intel GMA 3150 sufficient. Also a so called "Optimus" Mode (meaning both chips are available via lspci) is available but the "Hot-Switching" between both chips is currently not possible.

To set the desired Vga Mode for the next boot you need to issue a acpi_call (see VGA Modes 1 - 3 below). You will need to install a custom kernel module from the <nowiki>[[http://linux-hybrid-graphics.blogspot.com/2010/07/using-acpicall-module-to-switch-onoff.html|linux-hybrid-graphics]]</nowiki> project for your current kernel.

''Preperations:''

* install nvidia binary driver : The Nvidia GT218 Chip will only work with newer binary drivers than the default ones shipped with Maverick (minimum 260.19.06) so install the latest nvidia binary driver from the x-swat ppa:
 {{{
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates
 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
 }}}
 <nowiki>[[http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/514037/|Vdpau Benchmarks]]</nowiki> with Nvidia Driver 260.19.06

* install the acpi_call kernel module from the <nowiki>[[http://linux-hybrid-graphics.blogspot.com/2010/07/using-acpicall-module-to-switch-onoff.html|linux-hybrid-graphics]]</nowiki> project:
 {{{
 git clone http://github.com/mkottman/acpi_call.git
 cd acpi_call
 make
 sudo insmod acpi_call.ko
 }}}

 Or install this DKMS package (<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuone.com/p/dil/|acpicall-dkms_0.1_all.deb]]</nowiki>) to auto-build and update the module for all installed kernels.

 After the install of the dkms deb package run
 {{{
 sudo modprobe acpi_call
 }}}
 to load the kernel module. dmesg reports "acpi_call: Module loaded successfully" if it worked.

''VGA Modes:''

* '''Mode 1: Intel GMA 3150'''

 To enable the intel vga for the next boot, switch to root (sudo -s) and run
 {{{
 echo "\OSGS 0x01" > /proc/acpi/call
 }}}
 Set the intel driver in xorg.conf
 {{{
 ...
 Section "Device"
 Identifier "Device0"
 Driver "intel"
 VendorName "Intel GMA 3150"
 BusID "PCI:0:2:0"
 EndSection
 ...
 }}}
 Point xorg to the intel glx module and set the mesa libgl (still as root)
 {{{
 rm /usr/lib/xorg/extra-modules/libglx.so
 update-alternatives --set gl_conf /usr/lib/mesa/ld.so.conf
 ldconfig
 }}}
 Now reboot.

* '''Mode 2: Nvidia GT218 (Next Gen Ion)'''

 To enable the Nvidia Chip for the next boot, switch to root (sudo -s) and run
 {{{
 echo "\OSGS 0x02" > /proc/acpi/call
 }}}
 Set the nvidia driver in xorg.conf
 {{{
 ...
 Section "Device"
 Identifier "Device0"
 Driver "nvidia"
 VendorName "Nvidia GT218"
 BusID "PCI:4:0:0"
 EndSection
 ...
 }}}
 Point xorg to the nvidia glx module and set the nvidia libgl (still as root)
 {{{
 ln -s /usr/lib/xorg/extra-modules/libglx.so.270.26 /usr/lib/xorg/extra-modules/libglx.so
 update-alternatives --set gl_conf /usr/lib/nvidia-current/ld.so.conf
 ldconfig
 }}}
 NOTE: Replace libglx.so.''270.26'' with the Version of your installed nvidia driver.

 Now reboot.

* '''Mode 3 : Intel GMA 3150 and Nvidia GT218 (Next Gen Ion)'''

 This mode keeps both VGA Chips active, but currently only the intel chip can be used in this mode. Work is going on to make "Hot-Switching" possible, so keep your fingers crossed ;)

 To enable Optimus mode for next boot, switch to root (sudo -s) and run
 {{{
 echo "\OSGS 0x03" > /proc/acpi/call
 }}}
 and proceed with the Steps outlined in Mode 1 above.

 To save power after the reboot in Optimus mode, turn off the nvidia chip via another acpi_call (acpi_call.ko module needs to be loaded again):
 {{{
 echo "\_SB.PCI0.P0P4.DGPU.DOFF" > /proc/acpi/call
 }}}
 This will give you additional 2 hours of battery life.

To automate this procedure you might want to write yourself a bash script or use one of the scripts provided in <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1677780|this]]</nowiki> ubuntuforums.org thread.

* '''Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.04 Beta2 Lucid'''
  Wireless b&g and bluetooth work out of the box.  2-finger scrolling is disabled by default but enabling in the mouse setting works as expected.  Fan runs too much, add these 2 lines to /etc/rc.local to slow it down.
    echo "1" > /sys/devices/platform/eeepc/hwmon/hwmon1/pwm1_enable
    echo "70" > /sys/devices/platform/eeepc/hwmon/hwmon1/pwm1
  At 70 the fan is still audible but no longer annoying and the cpu temp stats below 55C during typical usage.  Implementing a fancontrol script modified for the Eee is probably a good idea.

==== Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10 Karmic ====

Most of the stuff works fine out of the box. Wireless and Wired network cards ready to use. The Intel Atom processor bug seems pretty well fixed. Graphics card driver working well also. Webcam working fine. Very nice optimization for this device!

Issues:

* Microphone issue already reported (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/449855). To fix, open a terminal and type 'sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic'

* Bluetooth not working out of the box

* Wireless (Atheros AR9285) works out of the box, but connection is flaky. To fix, open a terminal and type 'sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-karmic'

* Multi-touch will not work out of the box. Activate at "System -> Preferences -> Mouse -> Touchpad -> Scrolling -> Two-finger scrolling" and install shell script from <nowiki>[[http://blog.twinapex.fi/2009/10/11/setting-up-multi-touch-scrolling-for-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala-linux-on-asus-eee-1005ha-netbook/|Setting up multi-touch scrolling for Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala Linux on Asus Eee 1005HA netbook]]</nowiki>

==== Ubuntu 10.4 Lucid Netbook Edition ====

Overall impression quite similar to previous 9.10 installation on this device: Most devices like graphics, wireless, sound, etc. work out of the box and very nice optimization for this device!

Issues:
* for wireless issue (see Karmic) Run 'sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-generic' instead.

* Microphone does not work out of the box. Install the pulse audio volume control app 'sudo apt-get install pavucontrol' and at the Input Devices tab, set front left channel to 100% and the front right channel to 0%.

* Hotkeys don't work out of the box, you have to add a kernel parameter to the grub config:

** Run 'sudo gedit /etc/default/grub'

** Edit the line with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and add " acpi_osi=Linux". The line should then look like -> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux"

** Save and then run 'sudo update-grub'

** Reboot

* Multitouch doesn't work out of the box.
** Open your textediting program e/g gedit. kate, kwrie, mousepad etc

** Paste this in it. (Each command on a separate line. )
   <pre>
# !/bin/bash
sleep 10
xinput set-int-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" "Two-Finger Scrolling" 8 1

** Save the file somewhere as .sh extension

** Now go here.System > Preferences > Sessions and click on Startup Programs. Click 'Add' and enter the name of the script(for example: sh '/home/username/Documents/multitouch.sh').

** reboot.

* Bluetooth doesn't work out of the box, haven't tried to fix that yet

Not to be confused with <nowiki>[[#Asus Eee PC 1005PE|1005PE]]</nowiki> due to some significant hardware differences!

==== Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Netbook Edition ====

Same issues and solutions as in 10.4 for microphone and brightness control.

==== Ubuntu 10.4 Lucid Netbook Edition ====
Note: Wireless worked fine out of the box.

Issues:

* The microphone does not work out of the box with Skype. To get Skype working, install the pulse audio volume control app 'sudo apt-get install pavucontrol'. At the Input Devices tab of the app, set the front left channel to 90% and the front right channel to 10%. Sound Capturing should now work with Skype. You must also be sure to untick the box 'allow Skype to automatically adjust my mixer levels'. Not doing so will cause these settings to be reset.

* Brightness control doesn't work properly. Pressing Fn-F5 or Fn-F6 changes the brightness randomly.
** To get best support for hotkeys, update your BIOS to the latest version then add some kernel parameters to the grub config. Run <code>sudo gedit /etc/default/grub</code>
** Edit the line with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and add "` acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor`". The line should then look like -> <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor"</code>
** Save and then run <code>sudo update-grub</code>
** Reboot
** xbacklight, and xgamma work too..

* Multi touch pad doesn't work out of the box. Probably the same with all synaptics touchpads in all laptops (they work like a normal touch pad)
** http://blog.mfabrik.com/2009/10/11/setting-up-multi-touch-scrolling-for-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala-linux-on-asus-eee-1005ha-netbook/  The emulation approach works with 1005p! With it you get 2-finger scrolling, and 2-finger right-click working. Zooming and rotating with 2 fingers wont work with the emulation approach.

* Hard disk makes frequent clicking noise when using battery power
** Workaround is to disable Advanced Power Management on the hard disk. Kernel parameters "apm=off" and "noapm" don't seem to achieve this. Add the following to the end of /etc/hdparm.conf:
<pre>
/dev/sda {
	apm = 254
	apm_battery = 254
}
</pre>

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic 64 bit ====

[Actually wireless did work out of the box when installing 9.10, 2010-Mar-18]

Issues:

* Wireless does not work out of the box. As of 2009-02-01, use the Windows XP driver with ndiswrapper to get it to work:
** Run 'sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-utils-1.9 ndisgtk'
** Go to [http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx] and under "Please select  your product", select "Eee Family", "Eee PC", and "Eee PC 1005P", click on "Search", and then select "WinXP" (not Linux!) as operating system. Then click on "Wireless" and download the driver for "Wlan: '''NE785H_GE112H'''" from whatever location; unzip that file.
** Run ndisgtk; "Install new driver", and in the folder you unzipped in the last step, open the subfolder "ndis5x64" (if you're running a 64bit Ubuntu; if you're on 32bit, open "ndis5x" instead) and select "netathwx.inf". Installing this file should give you working Wireless!
* The microphone issue as known from other Eee PCs is present (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/449855). To fix, open a terminal and type 'sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic'. The mic should then work after a reboot (tested both with the sound recorder app and Skype).
* brightness control doesn't work properly. Pressing Fn-F5 or Fn-F6 changes the brightness randomly.
** solution to adjusting brightness http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1412922
** xbacklight, and xgamma work too..
* Multi touch pad doesn't work out of the box. Probably the same with all synaptics touchpads in all laptops (they work like a normal touch pad)
** http://blog.mfabrik.com/2009/10/11/setting-up-multi-touch-scrolling-for-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala-linux-on-asus-eee-1005ha-netbook/  The emulation approach works with 1005p! With it you get 2-finger scrolling, and 2-finger right-click working. Zooming and rotating with 2 fingers wont work with the emulation approach.

=== Asus Eee PC 1005PE ===
==== Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10 Karmic ====
As with the 1005HA, most of the stuff works fine out of the box, although there are some minor wireless connection issues.

Issues:

* To fix initial keyboard and touchpad problems, update your BIOS. Download the update from the asus homepage or use the preinstalled asus autoupdate windows app (if you haven't already wiped your windows partition ;-) ).

* The microphone issue with the 1005HA seems to be present (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/449855). To fix, open a terminal and type 'sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic'. The mic should then work after a reboot (at least with the sound recorder app). To get Skype working, install the pulse audio volume control app 'sudo apt-get install pavucontrol'. At the Input Devices tab of the app, set the front left channel to 90% and the front right channel to 10%. Sound Capturing should now work with skype.

* Wireless works out of the box, but connection is flaky. To fix, open a terminal and type 'sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-karmic-generic'

* Multi-touch has not been tested. It is likely that the issue mentioned in the 1005HA will be present as it appears to be the same hardware.

* Head-phones do not always disable internal speakers.  This can be manually corrected by going to the System tab and, under preferences, choosing the sound option.  On the output tab, at the bottom, is a connector choice.  Headphones can be chosen from here.  This will ensure all of the sound comes through the headphones only.  Follow the same steps, choosing analog output, to return sound to the internal speakers.

==== Kubuntu 9.10 Karmic 32 bit ====
* Mostly works out of the box

* My 1005PE has Wireless Atheros AR9285 working with standard ath9k driver

* Attansic Ethernet NIC uses atl1c driver ; supported in LiveCD and after install, but unsupported in "Alternate text-mode install CD"

* Brightness keys (Fn-F5 and Fn-F6) work completely randomly as stated for Karmic-64. This can be solved by adding "''acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor''" to the boot command line, per <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8874600#post8874600|ubuntuforums]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC/Model/1005pe|Debian Wiki]]</nowiki>. That works :-)

* Microphones not working initially. Installing ''linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic'' plus ''pavucontrol'' do the trick, in Skype as well. backport-modules are not needed in Lucid Beta 1.

* Plugging earphones unfortunately doesn't shutdown internal loudspeakers. Couldn't find any solution nor turn loudspeakers off manually so far, however this is solved in Lucid Beta 1 + latest Lucid updates.

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic 64 bit ====
* Wireless doesn't work out of the box - 1005PE (and also 1005P) apparently have a new, not yet supported card Atheros AR2427 (PCI ID 168C:002C).
* Brightness keys (Fn-F5 and Fn-F6) work kind of randomly. [I noticed this on a 1005PE with UNR9.10-32bit. Should this really be under the 64 bit heading?]

==== Kubuntu 10.04 Lucid 32 bit (Beta 1) ====
* Everything works out of the box

* Except for LCD brightness adjustment that needs booting with the "''acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor''" options in the boot command line (so this option needs to be added into the grub configuration). See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/512567|Ubuntu bug #512567]]</nowiki>.

* It is worth noting that all EeePC "hotkeys" I have tried work in KDE (Suspend, Wi-Fi enable/disable, touchpad disable, LCD brighness when booted with proper option cf. above, audio volume and mute)

* All these hotkeys work WITHOUT needing to install the "eeepc-acpi-scripts" and "rfkill" packages.

* It is worth noting that the Wi-Fi enable/disable hotkey (Fn-F2) actually acts both on Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet (<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/557048|Ubuntu Bug #557048]]</nowiki>).

==== Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.04 Lucid 32 bit ====
* Same results as noted above in Kubuntu 10.04 Lucid 32 bit (Beta 1)

* While the stereo microphones work with Ubuntu in general, they do not work with Skype. The two steps to resolve this issue are to first, go into alsamixer and set either the Left or Right microphone channel to a very high number (I set mine at around 90) and the other at zero (0). Second, after launching Skype, go into the Options settings and select Sound Devices. Uncheck the box labeled "Allow Skype to automatically adjust my mixer level". Doing the first will actually fix the problem with Skype. Doing the second will make sure Skype doesn't reset the levels back to their defaults.

==== Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick 32 bit ====
* Similar results as per Kubuntu 10.04 32 bit above, except that wireless works fine.

* Hotkeys for screen brightness work (but see note below), as does the sleep key and volume.

* Hotkey for wireless does not work, so you have to switch it on/off in Windows and are stuck with its state in Ubuntu thereafter.

* Screen brightness issue as noted elsewhere, does not seem to be fully fixed by adding grub configuration as above (not bright enough?).

=== Asus Eee PC 1005PEB ===
==== Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10 Karmic ====
* Keyboard and touchpad appear functional out of the box.
* Multi-touch does not appear to be functional.
* Microphone fix for 1005PE (installing backport) is required, but seems to work.
* Brightness key randomness can be resolved with by adding "''acpi_osi=Linux''" to the boot command line, per <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8874600#post8874600|ubuntuforums]]</nowiki>.
* Wireless: fails to connect to a WAP using a shared 128-bit ASCII WEP key. Connectivity successful in the pre-packaged Windows 7 Starter Edition. Installing backport does not resolve the issue. Connected successfully to a different WAP using a WPA PSK.
* Plugging in external headphones does not disable internal speakers.  This can be manually corrected by going to the System tab and, under preferences, choosing the sound option.  On the output tab, at the bottom, is a connector choice.  Headphones can be chosen from here.  This will ensure all of the sound comes through the headphones only.  Follow the same steps, choosing analog output, to return sound to the internal speakers.

=== Asus Eee PC X101ch ===
==== Xubuntu 12.04 LTS ====
* works with 800x600 out of the box, but if you install the  Intel Cedarview the screen stays completely black. This worked for me: http://daily.siebler.eu/2012/06/ubuntu-12-04-driver-for-intel-cedarview-atom-n2000-und-d2000-serie/ but in addition I had to  replace the previous lightdm.conf file in /etc/lightdm (use lightdm.conf.cedarview-drm) and to comment out the line <code>#blacklist cedarview_gfx</code> in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-local.conf and use <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nomodeset"</code> in /etc/default/grub (and finally run update-grub2). I'm using Kernel 3.2.0-34-generic from standard ubuntu repository.
* network: since wpa2 was working quite easily I didn't pay attention to the cable network. I have created a wpa_supplicant.conf file and edit it by hand (I don't like gui tools that sometimes work and sometimes not...). I had do switch eth0 to manual (otherwise boot hangs for a long time if no cable is connected). I installed the package resolvconf My /etc/network/interfaces:<pre>
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
        wireless yes
        wireless-mode managed
        wireless-essid MY-ESSID
        wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

iface eth0 inet manual}}}
* Touchpad: I noticed that it helps a bit to disable the touchpad during typing (xfce-settings, mouse and touchpad, devices, touchpad, there is a checkbox for this), however I was not that satisfied, so I created a script toggletouchpad:{{{
TPID=$(xinput list | grep TouchPad | sed 's#.*id=##' | awk '{print $1}')
STAT=$(xinput list-props $TPID | grep Enabled | awk '{print $NF}')
NEWSTAT=$(echo $STAT | awk '{print 1-$0}')
xinput set-prop $TPID "Device Enabled" $NEWSTAT}}}
(I hope this wiki finally accepts my scripting...) and assigned it in xfce-settings, keyboard to the "toggle-touchpad hotkey" (Fn-F3)

Power Management does not work in Ubuntu 9.10, does not suspend or resume, or hibernate, sleep... if it would go in, it locks up.  Broadcom wifi does not work on liveUSB, you'll have to install and navigate to the pool directory and install drivers off the USB install media with dpkg.  It is speedy,  and the power management issues might have something to do with having an SD card mounted  http://www.mydellmini.com/forum/ubuntu-netbook-remix/14722-suspend-hibernate-mini-9-broken.html.  Also, the 4gb SSD drives report being ran outside of parameters

=== Dell Mini 10 (Inspiron 1010) ===

This netbook has a host of problems, as detailed below:

1. Most importantly, Intel's GMA500 support has been incomplete over the years. The currenly default free gma500 driver does not realize the full hardware potential: Unity is unusable, youtube videos stutter, screen flickers, etc; if you are lucky, there is no black screen on boot, and the resolution is correct. Ultimately, Intel has failed to provide a decent workable Linux driver, either free or non-free, for its own piece of hardware.
See the Poulsbo wiki for more info.

 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsPoulsbo

2. Sound sometimes breaks on Lucid, with the "azx_get_response timeout, switching to single_cmd mode" error in the logs.

3. Brightness keys don't work.

4. Suspending to RAM works, but waking up is 50/50.

5 The internal mic works in Lucid, but with some annoying crackling.

6. The touchpad is Elantec with integrated buttons - takes getting used to. Used to be recognized as a mouse in Lucid so that no touchpad configurations where available. Recognized properly in Lucid as of kernel 2.6.32-33, but is mis-configured.

WiFi did not work out of the box with 9.10. Solution was to install bcmwl-kernel-source to get it to work. It is possible this was related to some lockup issues. An alternative is to install b43-fwcutter instead of bcmwl-kernel-source. Make sure only one of these two are installed at once. The b43-fwcutter package also requires linux-backports-modules-karmic (or kernel 2.6.32 and above).

=== Dell Mini 12 (Inspiron 1210) ===

Some features work very well: WiFI, webcam, sound playing, usb, touchpad.  Video problem common with other netbooks with GMA 500 chipset: performance with default VESA graphics is very slow.  Consult <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsPoulsbo/|Intel GMA500 "Poulsbo" video hardware support]]</nowiki> for accelerated driver information.

Some users question whether UNR should be used with relatively large 12" screen (1280x800 resolution).

=== Dell Latitude 2100 ===
Works fine after some configuration. You have to install idc-touch package for touchscreen and <nowiki>[[http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php|driver for wi-fi]]</nowiki> and "sudo update-initramfs -u" after blacklisting. There are crashes when using compiz with kernels in Ubuntu 9.04, but in 9.10 it seems okay. Webcam not tested.

=== Dell Lattitude D420 ===
Works fine after some configuration. You have to install Broadcom [[http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php|driver for wi-fi] manually for wireless, no other problems found.

=== Fujitsu M2010 ===
{{http://www.tekniikanmaailma.fi/s/f/editor/Fujitsu_M2010.jpg}}

All working out of the box: wifi, webcam, hotkeys, sound, usb, card reader, touchpad, mic (jack works but not the build in, for Skype must be enabled, default mute). etc. To make internal mic working it needs to modify /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf and to add 'model=fujitsu' for snd-hda-intel module. So last string of original alsa-base.conf becomes as the following (without quotes) "options snd-hda-intel model=fujitsu power_save=10 power_save_controller=N". Even when I connect my headset for skype it mutes the netbooks own speakers. Compiz not tested (I dont use), bluetooth not tested yet.

The tested UNR was 9.10 karmic.

=== Gateway LT2005u ===

Works very well with Lucid installed from Live USB stick. This is supposedly most of the same hardware from the Acer Aspire One. Tested: wifi, touchpad, function keys, power management. Media card slot also seems to work.

Not tested: Audio recording. Webcam not fully tested but works with Cheese app.

=== Gateway LT2107h ===

This was tested under UNE 10.04

Almost everything works well out of the box including the webcam, mic, headphone jack, volume, VGA out, ethernet and most of the hotkeys.

The main issues I experienced were:

* Touchpad - only the scroll works out of the box. There is no multi-gesture and I've yet to find a solution.
* The wireless hotkey does not work.
* The card reader does not work.
* Screen brightness hot keys would adjust the brightness in increments of roughly 3 steps. This is a common problem that I was able to fix by editing the Grub configuration file.
 {{{
 sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
 }}}
 Edit the line that says ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"'' to say:
 {{{
 GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor splash"
 }}}
 Then update Grub:
 {{{
 sudo update-grub2
 }}}
 Then restart

I also ran Curnchbang Statler XFCE alpha 2 from USB with pretty much the same results.

=== Gateway LT2115u ===

Works very well. This is almost identical hardware to the Acer Aspire One 532H. Tested: wifi, wired ethernet, touchpad, function keys, power management, suspend and more. All work. The media card slot work perfectly too. No tweaks are required.

Wifi works totally great out of the box.

The touchpad has the same issue as the Lucid beta. The edge scrolling doesn't work out of the box. But the fix is simple: see post 4: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1470975]]</nowiki>
It's a very simple fix that immediately resolves the issue.

Not tested: Audio recording, webcam, a few other things.

Other than the touchpad edge scrolling, everything I have tested works out of the box.

The fan works properly. I'm not seeing any power management issues related to excessive CPU wakeups. I did test <nowiki>[[Brian Rogers's 2.5.35rc6 kernel|https:--launchpad.net-~brian-rogers-+archive-power]]</nowiki> with the power management patch applied and powertop reported a small improvement. However, even with the stock kernel, the laptop fan and temperature are within normal ranges. No problems.

UPDATE: when kernel 2.6.34 is installed (using kernel team PPA), a couple minor annoyances show up that are not present with the stock Ubuntu kernel:
1. The battery status is sometimes reported incorrectly as "battery critically low" when it is not in fact low. Waiting a few minutes usually causes it to correct itself. No action is needed. But it is annoying. Seems to happen using wired ethernet connection (and does not happen on WiFi, afaict.)
2. The battery icon is wrong when using wired ethernet connection. The battery icon is replaced by an A/C power icon. This doesn't happen when using WiFi.
3. Sometimes the battery isn't recognized and the OS thinks it is running on A/C power. A suspend/resume resolves that.
The 2.6.34 kernel has TRIM support for SSD's, but the stock kernel actually seems better on this netbook. (But the SSD sure is fast. And it will work with the stock kernel.)

Overall, the experience is great. I'm running Ubuntu partly because the problems on Windows are terrible. There's a hardware driver that crashes a lot on Windows and the manufacturer isn't keen to fix it. (It's a piece of hardware I must use for work.) The open source driver works 100% - no problems and it is very robust. So with Ubuntu, I don't have any crashes.

Other distros tested on the Gateway LT2115u:
In addition to Ubuntu 10.04 32 bit, I tested netbook remix and Linux Mint 9 (gnome). All worked great on this netbook.

FWIW, I also tested an Asus Eee PC 1005PE. I think the Gateway LT2115u has a better keyboard, better screen, is lighter, etc.
I tested the Acer Aspire One 532H-2789. It is almost identical to the Gateway LT2115u. However, the touchpad with edge scrolling works out of the box.

=== HP Mini 1010nr ===
Everything except wifi works "out of the box"; webcam, hotkeys, 3D Graphics, sound, USB, touchpad, mic, etc.

A wifi fix has been made available by performing the following:

1. Connect to Ethernet.

2. Update WL using System->Administration->Update Manager.

3. Restart.

4. Go to System->Administration->Hardware Drivers

5. Deactivate b43 and STA drivers.

6. Reactivate b43 drivers.

8. Close Hardware Drivers and open Synaptic Package Manager.

9. Flag bcmwl-modaliases for removal.

10. Flag bcmwl-kernel-source for (re)installation.

11. Apply changes and restart.

12. Wireless will be functional, and remains functional after subsequent restarts.

=== HP Mini 1033cl ===
<nowiki>[[http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?product=3832496&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&lang=en&cc=us|{{http://i318.photobucket.com/albums/mm412/mehtuus/hpmini1033cl-sm.jpg}}]]</nowiki>
Everything works "out of the box"; wifi, webcam, hotkeys, 3D Graphics, sound, USB, touchpad, mic, etc.

At least two users have reported that Wi-Fi did not work out of the box. The following is a temporary workaround for the issue:

1. Connect to Ethernet.

2. Update WL using System->Administration->Update Manager.

3. Restart.

4. Go to System->Administration->Hardware Drivers

5. Deactivate Broadcom Wireless drivers.

6. Reactivate Broadcom Wireless drivers. Drivers will reinstall.

7. Unplug from Ethernet.

8. Wireless will be functional.

NOTE: This is not a permanent fix, as the driver reinstallation process must be done after every boot.

=== HP Mini 1151nr ===
* Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10 Karmic:
Upon first boot in order to get the wifi working you will have to hookup ethernet and remove the b43 wifi module and install the wl module.
The Qualcomm Gobi radio works fine using the hp-wmi and qcserial kernel modules with the gobi loader and udev. <nowiki>[[http://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/gobi_loader/]]</nowiki> To load the correct firmware for the card. You can download the firmware and extract it using wine from hp.com.

=== HP Mini 110 / Compaq Mini 100c/110c ===
* Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10 Karmic:
The Karmic version "just works", with almost everything supported, without tweaking. Wired NIC works nicely, sound works nicely, built-in SD card reader works too. The wireless driver needs to be activated first -- choose the STA one, not the b43 (which makes the machine hang during boot).

One user reports a case of the wireless drivers not working initially. Possible Fix <nowiki>[[http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg1669880.html]]</nowiki>

Installing Broadcom wireless proprietary driver with Jockey (the only one which make things work) breaks internal Bluetooth. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/499445/]]</nowiki>

Some users report that the mic doesn't work also <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/376795/]]</nowiki>

* Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.04 Lucid:
Everything works out of the box but the recommended Broadcom STA driver does not appear to activate in live mode. Furthermore, on booting after installation a blank screen appears with a flashing cursor due to this issue. The workaround for this is to press Shift on reboot until the GRUB menu appears and select the recovery mode, followed by the fail safe graphics mode. Once booted into this low resolution mode, a standard restart should allow the computer to boot normally, but it many not boot properly on further attempts which is why it's imperative to immediately plug in an ethernet cable and enter the following two terminal commands to install the STA driver:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get --reinstall install bcmwl-kernel-source

Following this the user should reboot their computer to check that they can boot normally, and that the wireless driver is now active.

There are no problems with the microphone here (though it is advised to turn the input all the way up in the Sound application) and Bluetooth does not break.

* Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid:

110c: Everything, except hibernate, works as soon as the wireless device is installed.
Same problems as with the netbook remix: After install, you once need to start recovery mode.  Then you need to connect wired internet and install wireless driver.

=== HP Mini 110-1120es ===

* Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic works out of the box, but you have to install the proprietary wireless broadcom driver. It's the STA, not the b43. Mic won't work either. I wouldn't recomend the method used on the link above (for the generic Mini 110) since the kernel change breaks the filesystem and erases wireless again. Keep an eye on lauchpad for updates.

=== HP Mini 110-1030 CA ===
* Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.10 : works out of the box. sound works, camera works, WLAN works.

=== HP Mini 210-1014SG ===

Works fine with Ubuntu 10.04 32Bit. It works out of the Box. Only the mute LED is always on, but you hear sounds and you can mute it...it doesn´t matter.
The wifi card is working fine too, you only have to install the "special" hardware driver for this card, it works with wpa2 and the other encryption modes.
The builtin webcam is working too. Skype knows this builtin webcam and you can use this one for your skype video chats.
The ethernet card is only a 10/100Mbit card, but it works. The keys for changing the brightness and volume are working too, you have to take the combination fn+alt+F1-12 Key for getting a F1-12 command, without pressing fn+alt you got the sourtcut for brightness and volume.

A very important bios function is "Fan Always ON" turn this on to Off, and the fan will only rotate if it is necessary, if dont change it to off, the fan will always rotate with about 1500rpm...

Comment 2010 july 21: Not that quite simple. Problems are with touchpad and wireless - latter needs restricted Broadcom driver to be installed to work and touchpad-problem needs this solution

Note too that models hardware components may vary in different areas of the world and according to time model is made.

==== HP Mini 210 ====
Very annoyingly, this netbook came with a preinstalled Windows 7 - light, with a HP recovery partition and another primary system partition, which made all the primary partitions taken, leaving no more space for Ubuntu partitions. Therefore I had to backup one HP partition externally, and turn the free space into an Extended partition, where then Ubuntu could do its thing (of course it is also an option to totally delete all the HP and Windows 7 stuff)
Then another problem was that the Wifi didn't work out of the box with the 11.10 install USB stick - when the Ubuntu install mode was selected at boot up. But when The Ubuntu live version was selected, the required river was installed, and from there, the install of Ubuntu from the live USB went without problems, also installing the Wifi driver. For the rest see remarks above.

Also, booting with a live usb happens after hitting repeatedly F9, otherwise W7 just reigns.

Now just need to find out how to modify the Unity menu...

And what is the deal now with "Intel Graphics Media Accelerator for mobile"?
=== HP Mini 2133 ===

Works very well with 10.04 UNR.

* Installation goes straight forward.
* For wireless networking install the broadcom b43 restricted driver
* Openchrome is sufficient for browsing the internet and watching small videos

=== HP Mini 311 ===

Tried Ubuntu 9.10 standard edition (not UNR). Works well after some initial work. Although the live CD started up without a problem, once installed Ubuntu hangs before showing the boot splash icon, instead showing a blinking cursor, and never reaches login. (Presumably this is a Broadcom wireless driver error, see <nowiki>[[http://www.archivum.info/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/2009-12/16191/(Bug-479597)-Re:-HP-Mini-311--Does-not-always-boot.html|this discussion link]]</nowiki>.) I fixed this by booting into recovery mode and running updates:

1. Reboot and launch Memtest (or another non-Ubuntu boot option). When I tried booting into Recovery Mode immediately after failing to boot into normal mode, Recovery Mode would fail in the same place. Loading Memtest first seems to prevent this.

2. Then press ESC to quit Memtest and reboot into Recovery Mode.

3. Access the terminal and update your system:

$> sudo apt-get update

$> sudo apt-get upgrade

4. After updates are finished, reboot into normal Ubuntu. The splash, then login screen should come up, indicating that the error has been corrected.

This bug will likely not be present in 10.04.

Apart from that boot error, Ubuntu mostly works. The Restricted manager detected and installed the NVIDIA 3D graphics driver and the working Broadcom driver. Sound works out of the box, as well as microphone, webcam, and standby.

My only current pet peeve is that the touchpad is recognized only as a "generic mouse", and thus I can't disable the touchpad while typing or change other touchpad-specific settings (which all require the Synaptics touchpad driver).

=== HP Mini 2140 ===

=== Samsung N140 ===
Works pretty well out-of-the-box. Webcam, sounds, WLAN (at least the model with Atheros adapter) and sleep mode works perfectly. WLAN with Realtek adapter needs ndiswrapper and Windows' drivers (downloadable from support at www.samsung.com, but you only need the three files in the \Winxp2k sub folder.)

Some Fn-keys don't work out of the box. But can be configured to work.

=== Samsung N150 ===
WiFi didn't work from the 10.04 install image, but did once the installed Ubuntu had upgraded to the latest kernel and modules or if 10.10 is installed. The wireless can cause issues with hibernate/suspend, which can be fixed with <nowiki>[[http://www.backports.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8574835&postcount=3|this change]]</nowiki>. Even after this change, though, the wireless can occasionally fail to connect and the "modprobe -r" and "modprobe" step need to be run manually.  Sound and webcam work as with the N140.

Battery life is good: gets through a day of light use.  My biggest complaint is that without LVM support I wasn't able to set up dual-boot with the Win7 Starter that came on the device.

There are some brightness issues:
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/574250|574250]]</nowiki>

=== Samsung N220 ===
With dual boot set up in Grub by Ubuntu UNR installation, Win7 sometimes reports "Your computer was unable to start ... attempting repairs" and does not start. If you opt to skip the repair, it will start and appears to operate normally.
In UNR, screen is very dim (unlike Win7), on both AC and battery power, at least by default. This can be corrected by starting the BIOS configuration utility by pressing F2 before the grub window opens, selecting "user control" instead of "auto" for screen brightness, and then, after rebooting, while still in the grub menu pressing <Fn> and <up> repeatedly until the screen is at maximum brightness. The new setting will be retained between boots, but after using Win7, it may be necessary to repeat the <Fn> <up> procedure while in grub.
Internal microphone works, but level is low and quality is poor. The internal mic is #2 and is not selected by default. Acoustic feedback between mic and speaker makes using Skype difficult.
Wireless LAN is not detected initially. From the terminal "lspci" typed at the prompt reports that the the network controller is Realtek 8192 (rev 01). After setting up wireless networking in Win7, it worked there, and in UNR was then detected with a momentary message on boot saying that a network was available, and that one should click the [bar graph-like] icon to connect. The icon is not displayed until the connection is configured correctly in [MainMenu/System/Network Connections]. Once this is done, it works.
None of the function keys work in UNR.

* I find the N220 working very well. After changing the rules in udev (/lib/udev/rules.d/95-keymap.rules and /lib/udev/rules.d/95-keyboard-force-release.rules) in order for udev to use the vendor specific files even Fn-up and Fn-Down is recognized. I have mapped these keys to a small program that sets the backlight (a variant of http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1397371 post no 9). Otherwise everything worked out of the box.

==== Lucid Lynx ====
On Lucid all major functions work well once the proprietary wireless driver is installed (automatically detected). The remaining issues to do with the Fn keys for backlight control and enabling/disabling wireless, bluetooth, etc... are resolved by adding the <nowiki>[[http://www.voria.org/forum/|Voria]]</nowiki> ppa (ppa:voria/ppa).

* Works extremely well, everything works well out of the box
* With Ubuntu 9.10 wifi did not work out of the box for me. I enabled karamic-backports and installed the linux-backports-modules package, and wifi works now.

=== System76 Starling Netbook ===
* Not sure what hardware this branded netbook is <nowiki>[[www.system76.com]]</nowiki>, but it runs Jaunty flawlessly, including suspend/hibernate, webcam, wireless, and hot keys.  It comes installed, but in case you trash your system (like I did), you can install Ubuntu Jaunty from a USB key and then add System76's custom driver, which adds support for whatever hardware Ubuntu didn't.  It's really extremely simple, and a good little netbook.

=== Sony VAIO W ===
{{http://www.sony.co.uk/res/images/image/20/1237475656920.jpg}}

* Works very well. However, if user unplugs power computer will suspend, and energy configuration must (easily) be changed in order to skip this issue.

[Ross] You may find issues with booting/installing UNR from a USB pen drive. Upgrading the BIOS to version 1.90 resolved this in my case, however be warned that it resets your BIOS settings.  This may result in a BSOD in XP if you are dual booting and have changed from AHCI to compatibility mode (changing it back to compatibility fixed it).

Everything works apart from some of the function keys (most notably, the brightness controls). Suspend and hibernate work; wireless works; sound -- internal speaker and headphone socket -- works; mic works; webcam works.

For interest: I'm getting a battery life of around 4.5 to 5 hours with moderate use (browsing, youtube, word processing) after installing and accepting powertop's suggestions. I'm getting a boot time of around 20 to 30 seconds (32 bit version is a few seconds faster). Quakelive plays smoothly.

Overall, I would recommend this netbook with Ubuntu 10.04 desktop.

== Tier 2 ==
These are netbooks that work somewhat, but have problems that may interfere with typical activities at the moment, or many smaller issues.

=== Acer Aspire One 110 ===
Works well for most things, sound, webcam, ports all reported to work correctly.  Minor problems include media card reader issues unless it is booted with a card in the slot. A mounted SD Card in the Storage Expansion won't survive a suspend though. If you experience system freezes you may need to install linux-backports-modules-jaunty.

=== Acer Aspire One - Model ZA7 (manufactured 2009) ===

The video card, Intel GMA500 (Poulsbo), is not supported out-of-the-box. It requires installation of binary drivers that needs to be reconfigured after every kernel update.
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsPoulsbo/]]</nowiki>

Works: wireless, basic sound test.

=== Acer Aspire One D255 ===
Most things work out of the box.

Known issues:
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/530277|530277]]</nowiki> - 0cf2:6250 ENE Technology, Inc. card reader not supported (this thread contains a driver and howto install)
* Lucid Netbook Edition - Neither the wired nor the wireless cards worked.  Needed to install a compiler by downloading and installing a large number of .deb packages from packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/[package name].  These were transferred via USB and installed with sudo dpkg -i [package name].  Then, the instructions at <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOneAOD250?action=show&redirect=AspireOne%2FAOD250]]</nowiki> were followed to activate the Atheros atl1e network card driver.  Finally, after a sudo apt-get update, the proprietary Broadcom wireless drivers were downloaded and activated through the icon on Ubuntu's panel.

* Microphone and speaker external jacks tested and working. Using SKYPE  internal mic does not work but external does. To work around skype mic issue, instal pulse audio volume control, unlock channel padlock and slide one mic fully to left.
* Propietary wireless driver loads automatically using this kernel.

==== Ubuntu 11.10 ====
* Same issue as above - skype internal mic does not work out of the box. 
Either use pulse audio, as above, or add this line (if not present, else try edit as suggested here):

to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf 

and then reboot

=== Asus Eee Top 1602 ===

Devices appear to work fine except the touchscreen on version 10.04. Volume function keys work.

Brightness keys do not work, even when appending "acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor" to the grub command. It appears that eeepc_laptop module is not loading.

=== Asus Eee 1005HA ===
Tested with 9.04 NBR. Wireless (Atheros AR9285) doesn't work out of the box. The ath9k module which is supplied by default doesn't seem to work correctly. You have to download the backports .deb file to a usb stick and manually install it to get it working.

Wired nic (atl1e) doesn't work out of the box either. You have to download the sourcefile from the manufactorers page and install it. It's described in Ubuntuforums posting: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=7525735&postcount=2

The listed thread is slightly out of date.  The current source file from Atheros is:  AR81Family-linux-v1.0.0.10.tar.gz.  This archive has some kind of bug in it so it will not decompress with standard Linux tools.  Instead, download to a usb drive the p7zip-full package and install it first.  Then you can decompress the archive with: ~$ 7za x AR81Family-linux-v1.0.0.10.tar.gz

Then edit the kcompat.h which is found in the src folder and make the following changes:

Then do a make && sudo make install in the src folder to get your module installed.  (from this thread: http://forum.eeebuntu.org/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=4177&view=previous)

=== Asus Eee 1000HE ===
Wireless with 9.04 NBR has issues. The wireless connection sometimes goes off and on, will connect only after multiple attempts, and grab weak signal strength unless extremely close to the router. Installing backports can fix the connection issue but the signal strength problem remains. This model of EeePC uses different hardware than the Asus Eee 1000.

(But note that not all 1000HE's experience this problem. My 1000HE with Atheros chipset worked fine.)

Known issues:

=== Asus Eee900 ===
Works reasonably well with the current betas of Jaunty, but some minor issues such as sound recording not working.  One fairly annoying bug with the interface being very sluggish.  A patch and updated kernel are available that can be applied for now, or wait until after release when it should hopefully become available quickly through the normal update process.

=== Asus Eee 701-SD / 702 ===

This netbook basically works, but most of the problems with it center around the fact that it has a very small screen with a default resolution of 800x400 and many apps simply won't scale down to that size.

Mostly works.
** Inexplicable screen flickering that comes and goes in severity.
** Wireless card works out-of-book, but not after resuming from a suspend.

=== HP Mini 1000 ===
==== Lucid ====
Lucid Standard works out-of-the-box except for networking. If you wish to use ethernet (and you will, to get your wireless working), you must start the computer with the ethernet plugged in. After applying the ethernet fix below this restriction is lifted and you may plug in the ethernet at any time.
* Wireless does not work immediately. While the Jaunty fix listed below may work, I used the System->Administration->Hardware Drivers option this time and found that wireless worked after installing the restricted drivers.
* Ethernet port: Needs acpi_os_name=Linux passed as a kernel parameter. (Kudos to <nowiki>[[http://blog.technicallyworks.com/2009/11/few-tips-for-running-ubuntu-910-karmic.html|Oscar Kuo]]</nowiki>.)
* Note that the SDD in the HP Mini is prone to failure after repeated rewrites such as may be caused by Firefox's cache. Oscar Kuo's link above contains a tip for dealing with this by setting Firefox's "browser.cache.disk.parent_directory" to point to a RAM disk directory at "/dev/shm/firefox".

==== Karmic ====
Karmic Standard works out-of-the-box except for networking. Sound works immediately, in contrast to Jaunty. If you wish to use ethernet (and you will, to get your wireless working), you must start the computer with the ethernet plugged in. After applying the ethernet fix below this restriction is lifted and you may plug in the ethernet at any time.
* Wireless does not work immediately. Using "sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source" in the terminal and rebooting will resolve this issue without further problems. (Kudos to <nowiki>[[http://blog.technicallyworks.com/2009/10/getting-hp-mini-1000-wireless-to-work.html|Oscar Kuo]]</nowiki>.)
* Ethernet port: Needs acpi_os_name=Linux passed as a kernel parameter. (Kudos to <nowiki>[[http://blog.technicallyworks.com/2009/11/few-tips-for-running-ubuntu-910-karmic.html|Oscar Kuo]]</nowiki>.)

==== Jaunty ====
Jaunty UNR works on the HPMini, including wireless.  However there is a known bug with audio not working at the moment.
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/netbook-remix/+bug/318942|318942]]</nowiki> - no sound from speakers on HP Mini 1000 (hda-intel, IDT 92HD75B2X5)
* There is an outstanding bug involving default ethernet configurations <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/297263|297263]]</nowiki> which prevents ethernet from working if the laptop is booted without the ethernet plugged in.

=== HP Mini 1030nr ===
==== Karmic ====
Works out-of-the-box, but has some problems with wired connection: it doesn't work when hot-plugged, and causes system crash when hot-unplugged. Wireless, however, works well. The issue is caused by LAN power save feature, which is not handled by Ubuntu, and could not be disabled from BIOS for netbooks.
* More about LAN issue: <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/466325]]</nowiki>

=== Kohjinsha SH6 ===
Basically works using Jaunty UNR both as a live session and installed. Sound, video, external buttons, wireless is working. Touchscreen is working but the built-in Touchscreen Calibration tool does not work with it. The screen also does not come back after closing the lid or when it turns off for power saving.

After installing the Penmount driver, the sound rocker will stop working. This can be solved by removing the AddAutoDevices section in xorg.conf. No side-effects so far. See <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1166175|this thread]]</nowiki> for details.

Works very well with UNR 9.10 however got/had some small issues:
* After installing booting hangs. Solved by using noacpi option temporarily. Solved definitively by updating to latest kernel.
* Mic only works with some file formats (recording). Does not work with Cheese.
* Wireless network (BCM4312) only works with proprietary STA drivers.

=== Samsung N120 ===
Works well for most things, sound, webcam, ports all reported to work correctly.
* Wireless LAN not detected.

=== Samsung N510 ===
<nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-SamsungN510]]</nowiki>

Works well for most things, sound, webcam, ports all reported to work correctly.
* Wireless LAN not detected. (Works in Lucid)

=== Sony Viao P VGN-P13GH ===
Works well except for the graphics card being extremely laggy.
Auto detected native resolution but massive lag when moving around the menus, youtube 360p video plays 1 frame a second but fine audio.

True.  But try (Vaio P VGN-P788K) the steps outlined here:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsPoulsbo
as well as /etc/default/grub change (tailor mem to the amount of RAM):
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash mem=2000mb acpi_osi=Linux"
and
sudo apt-get remove mplayer
sudo apt-get install gnome-mplayer gecko-mediaplayer
made both video graphics decoding as well as maybe 10-30 fps video!

=== Toshiba NB205 ===
There are some issues on the wireless and the sound card.

* Wireless: This issue is solved by installing the linux-backport-modules-jaunty.
* Sound: Headphones enabled in guide linked below. The sound card is HDA Intel ALC272.

==== Lucid Lynx ====
* Installed properly (2010/05/17)
* Netbook launcher corrupted text and not responsive to mouse input (Fixable with the openchrome driver below)
* Virtual terminal corrupted graphics (corruption is fixable with the openchrome driver below, however the prompt exists below the bottom of the screen, so you can't actually see what you are typing)
* Updated Openchrome video card driver deb files can be retrieved from xorg-edgers: use the commands: add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers; apt-get update; apt-get upgrade from a terminal. (use Alt+F2 and enter xterm to open a terminal window)
* Odd mouse stuttering problem, mouse is "chunky" at times, possible regression from Karmic.
