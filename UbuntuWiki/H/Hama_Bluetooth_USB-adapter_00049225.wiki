I have tested this Bluetooth USB Adapter with Ubuntu v6.06 (Dapper Drake) and it worked out of the box. For sending files from my mobile - a Sony Ericsson T630 - to my laptop I just installed the package gnome-bluetooth. After starting gnome-obex-server the process of sending files was fairly trivial.

I bought this device because it was fairly cheap yet had a good range (class 1) and speed.
