== Introduction ==
On August 29th, 2007, Jono Bacon announced the next release, version 8.04, codenamed the Hardy Heron, on the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-August/000336.html|Ubuntu Developer Announce mailing list]]</nowiki>.

The focus for 8.04 for the Kubuntu community will be stability. Following the stability portion of our goals, the Kubuntu developers plan on implementing a new strategy which will allow Kubuntu to catch-up with some of the functionality of Ubuntu. No worries for those of you waiting for Kubuntu and KDE 4 as we have already released a <nowiki>[[http://kubuntu.org/~jriddell/cds/kubuntu-kde4-20071126.iso|LiveCD]]</nowiki> based on Kubuntu 7.10, the Gutsy Gibbon.

Alpha 2, the second in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Hardy development cycle, represent the very latest snapshots of Hardy. The pre-release images are known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs, however they are not recommended for use in stable environments. These releases will be for those who are developing, documenting, and testing. Alpha releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://se.cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/hardy/alpha-2/
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/hardy/alpha-2/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release version of Hardy are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Hardy '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''
