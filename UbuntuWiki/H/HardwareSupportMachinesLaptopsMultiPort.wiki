__TOC__

The Multiport is a slot located on certain Compaq Evo Notebooks. As far as I know, they are located on the N401C, N600c and N800c Laptops. There very well could be others. The Multiport slot allowed Compaq to add either a Bluetooth module or a Wireless Lan card. The Wireless lan card is "Compaq Wireless LAN W200" (as it says on mine). These drivers use the orinico_usb driver. (http://www.nongnu.org/orinoco)
