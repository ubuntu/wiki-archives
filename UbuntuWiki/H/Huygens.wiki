{*} Email: 
I am a computer scientist working in the space domain. At home, I am running Ubuntu 8.10 LTS (a.k.a. Intrepid Ibex) on my desktop (which has also Windows XP, though it gets pretty dusty nowadays). While working, I had a laptop (<nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-DellLatitudeD600|Dell Latitude D600]]</nowiki>) which was running perfectly Ubuntu 7.04.

For my personal web site, I wanted means to test new versions of my personal web pages without touching the online one, as well as being able to maintain and enhance it. I have build up an old PC and installed Ubuntu Server Edition 8.04.1 LTS with LAMP (the 'L' is a bit redundant here). It was so easy to do, impressive! I have mainly used those two documentation repositories, and that was it:
* <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/networking.html|Chapter 4. Networking]]</nowiki> (Official Documentation)
* <nowiki>[[http://gaming.gwos.org/doku.php/udsf:serverguide|Ubuntu server guide]]</nowiki> (Ubuntu Document Storage Facility)

I did not upgrade my server since then, because it is just working! ;-)

I like computer and Open Source philosophy of course, and beside that, I like my work (yes that can happen!!!), cycling, walking, travelling and reading! As for now, we have been travelling 1 year around the world backpacking, 1/2 month in Norway cycling (~900km), 1 month in New Zealand cycling (~1800km) and 3 months in Patagonia cycling (~3500km).
