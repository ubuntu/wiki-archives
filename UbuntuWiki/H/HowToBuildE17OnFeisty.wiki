'''''How To Build Enlightenment from CVS on Ubutnu/Feisty'''''

By Adhoc; adhoc at air-stream dot org

----

Ok, there is much to read from here; http://www0.get-e.org/E17_User_Guide/English/_pages/3.html

Covers background in building e from the libs etc

'''Notes:'''
 What is the install order?:: Eet, Evas, Ecore, Efreet, Embryo, Edje

 Why is there 'uninstall' and 'distclean' in the build script?:: because we can! well its in case you've part built and it ain't working yet =)

=== Step one ===
check out the e goodness from CVS, this will take some time;

<pre>
mkdir /usr/local/src
cd /usr/local/src
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.enlightenment.org:/var/cvs/e login
</pre>

=== Step two ===
open a new terminal window or flip to another console.
You will need to make sure you have the '''build dependencies; libraries, 
include files, etc. 160MB from memory'''

As root;

<pre>
apt-get update
apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libfreetype6 zlib1g-dev zlib1g xlibs-dev libx11-dev libpng12-dev 
</pre>

=== Step three ===
find your library source...

<pre>
cd /usr/local/src/e17/libs/
</pre>

=== Step four ===
Build up the base libraries, get your variables setup right;

<pre>
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
export CFLAGS=-g 
</pre>

Then compile the libraries;

<pre>
for d in eet evas embryo efreet ; do \
  ( cd $d ;          \
    make uninstall ; \
    make distclean ; \
    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/efl/ ; \
    make ;           \
    make install ) ; \
done
</pre>

=== Step five ===
Build up edje. Edje has a special option to include an extra library... Ecore-Evas

<pre>
for d in edje ; do   \
  ( cd $d ;          \
    make uninstall ; \
    make distclean ; \
    ./autogen.sh --enable-ecore-evas --prefix=/usr/local/efl/ ; \
    make ;           \
    make install ) ; \
done
</pre>

=== Step six ===
Build compile up e

<pre>
cd ../apps
for d in e ; do        \
   ( cd $d ;           \
     make uninstall ;  \
     make distclean ;  \ 
     ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/efl/ ; \
     make ;            \
     make  install ) ; \
done
</pre>
