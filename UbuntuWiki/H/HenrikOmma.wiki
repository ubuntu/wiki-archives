__TOC__

I work for Canonical as an information architect and manager of the Enterprise Applications Team. I've also been Ubuntu webmaster, maintainer of the Live CD Win``FOSS content, Ubuntu Accessibility Lead, and recently the Ubuntu QA Team Manager. 

I founded the OpenCD project in 2002 and later co-founded Software Freedom International, organisers of <nowiki>[[http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/|Software Freedom Day]]</nowiki>. I've been contributing to Ubuntu since Warty Beta, maintaining the Live CD WinFOSS collection. My main contributions to Ubuntu are in <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/access|accessibility]]</nowiki> and the original version of to Bughelper. I also designed the original Brainstorm with <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~stgraber|Stéphane Graber]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~ndeschildre|Nicolas Deschildre]]</nowiki>

In 2005 I completed a D.Phil. in theoretical astrophysics on the topic of <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_jets|galactic jets]]</nowiki> in  <nowiki>[[http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/perseus/more.html|cooling flow clusters]]</nowiki>. 

After a two years in my Native Norway I'm now back in the UK. I've recently taken an interest in photography, esp. <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_format_(film)|medium format film]]</nowiki>. I also maintain <nowiki>[[http://annarybacka.com/|Ania]]</nowiki>'s <nowiki>[[http://www.oxfordpictures.co.uk/|various]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[http://www.oxford-photostudio.co.uk/|websites]]</nowiki> who, unlike me, takes very good pictures ;)
