__TOC__

The material crushed by the Hammer Crusher (Hammer Mill) through the collisions between high-speed hammer and materials. The PC Hammer Crusher(Hammer Mill) were developed for both dry and wet crushing of brittle, medium-hard materials for the mining, cement, coal, metallurgic, construction material, road building, and petroleum & chemical industries. 

 Applications Coarse, secondary, third Crushing 
Field of application Agriculture, biology, construction materials, glass / ceramics, mining, mineralogy, metallurgy 
Feed material medium-hard, hard, brittle, tough 
Size reduction principle pressure 
Material feed size < 400mm 
The Final Fineness <15mm 
Material of Crushing tools manganese steel 
Durability depending on feed material 
Working Principle of Hammer Crusher: 
The motor drives the rotor rotates of the Hammer Crusher at a high speed through the belt, and on the rotor there are series hammers. When the materials get into the working area of hammers, they are crushed by the rotating hammers of the Hammer Crusher with high rotation speed, the products which are crushed to meet the required size can be discharged by the outlet and become the final products, the large size products are brought back to the crushed area by the hammers of the Hammer Crusher for being re-crushed until they reached the required size.

Product Advantages of Hammer Crusher (Hammer Mill) :
Simple structure, 
High reduction ration, 
High efficiency, 
Low Cost
