What I have trouble understanding is why some people don't see any value in such ideals. Some even actively reject them and find nothing wrong with promoting artificial scarcity. I tend to think this is a result of our capitalistic society.<<BR>><<BR>>I Love Linux because it offers me choice. It gives me the power and freedom to choose not only what I use, but how I use it. Products that stifle choice and competition are simply not going to be as good as those that foster them.<<BR>><<BR>>That's about all I can think of for now.

Complicating just needs a confusing mind." ''' ''<<BR>><<BR>>My vision is that Ubuntu will become a major platform for scientific research, teaching, computing and program development. One way of achieving this goal is to make sure that as many science applications as possible are available as packages that readily can be installed.<<BR>><<BR>>Linux is extremely well suited for teaching in higher education, because high quality software is available free of cost and freely distributable. Teachers in a course could simply hand out a copy of the CD to all their students, who could take it home and work with the relevant problems. It would be a great opportunity to present students to Linux wonders!<<BR>><<BR>>It's equally important that young talents have access to a stable platform well suited for program development. Linux is such a platform, with lots of tools, even sophisticated IDEs are available. What's important here is that the standard libraries used within the various scientific communities, are available in packages, so valuable time is saved getting this infrastructure set up.<<BR>><<BR>>If Ubuntu/Debian becomes a solid scientific platform, it will also encourage people to publish their software under a free software license (which has not been customary in our community) given the precious privilege of possibly getting their software into the distribution.<<BR>><<BR>>I'm very motivated to engage in work on an Ubuntu Science Edition. I imagine the debtags system might be something that could be helpful in this regard. While a standard, installable edition would certainly be desirable, it would also be extremely useful with a live CD, that could contain scientific software, databases, and various types of documentation. Perhaps the installable Science Edition could even include tools that would enable teachers to add their own custom material to the CD.<<BR>><<BR>>Such a free and user-friendly distribution can bring through its Open Source culture a quality education that fosters passionate, enthusiastic and ongoing expansion of knowledge and better educational approaches on behalf of young cooperating tech-savvy generations.<<BR>><<BR>>SIMPLE THINGS CAN MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE FOR SCHOOLS!
