=== Section Headings ===
You can create headings by starting and ending a line with up to five equal signs. The heading text is between those markers, separated by a single space.

Headings are not automatically numbered. So if you want to number your list then you need to add this by hand.

For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing. 

==== Example ====
<pre>
== Heading ==
=== Subheading ===
==== Level 3 ====
===== Level 4 =====
====== Level 5 ======
</pre> 

==== Display ====
== Heading ==
=== Subheading ===
==== Level 3 ====
===== Level 4 =====
====== Level 5 ======

Note that proper section numbering requires you to order sections according to a valid structure, i.e. correctly nested. Our sample doesn't do this, so you get a different numbering scheme than you might expect.
