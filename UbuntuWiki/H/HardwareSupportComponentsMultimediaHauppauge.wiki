| Tuner detected incorrectly. Fix the problem by using commands "sudo rmmod bttv" and "sudo modprobe bttv tuner=51". To make settings permanent, add lines "alias video0 bttv" and "options bttv tuner=51" into file /etc/modprobe.d/bttv and run "update-modules" while being root (or use sudo)

| Don't confuse this (as I did) with the older Nova-T USB2 widget which has a completely different chipset! Older firmware had I2C errors and random disconnects, but now works great after compiling latest v4l-dvb driver and installing latest firmware.

'''How``To - Hauppauge Remote Control in Kubuntu:'''
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=183545

'''For PVR-150 (and maybe others)''': if you want to change input from the default tv tuner to the composite input (yellow, red, white), run the following commands:

'''''v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 -n''''' - For getting the number of the desired input. Mine composite input is number 2.

'''''v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-input=2''''' - For setting the default input to the selected one. Replace the '2' after '--set-input=' with the correct number from the first command.
