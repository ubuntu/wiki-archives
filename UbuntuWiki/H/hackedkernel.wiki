Dear visitors,
My real name is Islam Farouk Mohamed Bahnasy known as "hacked kernel", I'm a computer science student.
The biggest dream from my childhood is to become a computer scientist and write my own operating system, that's why I'm interested in kernels so I'm hacked kernel :)

Linux as a kernel is the great project ever in my opinion and some times I feel jealous towards it, I hope my project make a success like this one.
