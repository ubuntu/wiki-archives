== Who I am ==
I am a member of Ubuntu Kylin Team since 2014.

== My Ubuntu story ==
When I was in college, I get to know Linux. Untill then, I acknowledged except windows Operating System, there are other OS in this world. It showed me the way to a marvelous world. At the final year of my school learning, I noticed Ubuntu Kylin, the official flavour of Ubuntu, was looking for candidates. So I made up my mind to join this team and devoted to it. Now, I have been working with Ubuntu/Ubuntu Kylin for 3 years.

=== My involvement ===

During my work in Ubuntu Kylin, I took part in the development of unity7, unity8 and UKUI, release work of all versions of Ubuntu Kylin. Developed and maintained ubuntu kylin packages such as ubuntu-kylin-wizard, kylin-greeter. In the mean time, I am a super forum host in Ubuntu Kylin Community. I answered lots of questions asked by users, attended many community activities as well.

=== Jack Yu ===
handsome_feng is the core developer of Ubuntu Kylin team. He is responsible for packaging and maintenance of all packages developed by Ubuntu Kylin team, including UKUI packages. He has been working on this for more than 4 years and done very good work. He cooperated with Aron Xu to upload UKUI packages into Ubuntu and Debian Archieve. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jackyu|Jack Yu]]</nowiki>

=== Maclin ===
handsome_feng has been devoted to Ubuntu Kylin project for years since its beginning. His work involves most aspects of Ubuntu Kylin distribution and community， especially in the recent two years. However, his most important and time consuming work is developing and maintenance of Ubuntu Kylin related packages, such as unity, UKUI, youker series apps，etc. He is also a studious, conscientious and trustworthy colleague. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:maclin.jun|maclin]]</nowiki>

=== Anthony Wong ===
I worked with Feng on various things in Ubuntu Kylin. Although I don't upload packages for him, he had done some great work for Ubuntu over the years. He has improved and learnt a lot since he first joined the project. One of his most prominent work is to make the launcher be able to move to screen bottom. It is not a trivial work and I saw him worked with Marco a lot to make it happen. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:anthonywong|Anthony Wong]]</nowiki>

----
== Endorsements ==

=== Aron Xu ===
I've sponsored most of Feng's Ubuntu Kylin packages. He is quite responsible for reacting on requests about the packages, and over the time he's capable of updating those packages without modifications. I would encourage him to release often and upload often, so that he could get more control over the pace. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:happyaron|Aron Xu]]</nowiki>
