== Details ==

==== Acer Aspire 1501 LMi ====
* Sound, video, network works out of the box.
* Suspend and Hibernate both work
* Wlan works but WPA needs ndiswrapper.
* OpenGL works great with both ATI drivers, I use the updated 8.30.3 driver, see http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide
* Everything also works with AMD64 (x86_64)
* If you have powernowd on for dynamic cpu scaling you can have thermal problems under heavy load because powernowd will override the thermal scaling, to avoid this disable powernowd by uninstalling or removing the service from startup. You can also keep powernowd when using battery but disable it when using AC.
* irda untested.
* modem untested.

==== Acer Aspire 1522 WMLI ====
* Sound, video, network works out of the box.
* Touchpad generates wrong tap-event (mouse2 instead of mouse1), unless i tap very hard.
* Special keys don't work.
* Suspend seems to work but is unreliable (requires a reboot sometimes)
* Wlan needs ndiswrapper. Ndiswrapper doesn't work in 64bit enviroment, works fine under 32bits.
* Powermanagement: gnome asks my password after closing the lid, but does not suspend.
* irda untested.
* modem untested.

==== Acer Aspire 1652 WLMi on Dapper ====
* Installation without problems or hangups, boots directly in to GNOME
* Broadcom LAN and Intel 2200BG Wireless LAN work in Dapper out of the box, only the leds on front panel are off
* Battery status is shown and also PowerManagement and SpeedStep works out of the Box, just Gnome applet is to be add to the panel for speedstep switching
* Lm_sensors (not installed after installation) don't find any supported hardware, so Fan control is managed by  ACPI bios, but the CPU and Hardisk are cooled better then in Windows, without overheating to much.
* For 3D acceleration the ATI propietary driver is needed, the ATI X300 is 100% supported byt the fglrx 8.26, after that XGL works without hangups.
more on http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=168618
* Did not checked the PCMCIA and Bluetoothh adapter (will in near future), but they are detected by the kernel, and modules are loaded, they seem to operate normaly and out of the box.

==== Acer Aspire 1681 WLMI ====
* Everything works out of the box, including Broadcom Lan (BCM 44xx), Intel 2200BG Wireless Lan ([des]activation using the dedicated led-button), Centrino SpeedStep, etc ...
* 3D-hardware acceleration for ATI's Mobility Radeon 9700 can be simply enabled intalling the right packages (sudo apt-get install fglrx or via Synapic)
* Wifi switch (a sort of LED) enables (des)activating the Wifi device, but no red light coming out from it (not important. Just use Gnome's wifi applet ;)
* Special keys (volume, play/pause, mail, etc) can be assigned using Gnome's "Keyboard Shortcuts"
* Suspend seems to work, never had to reboot when coming back from suspend mode
* CD/DVD Burning working quite good. IRDA not tested but should work
* Winmodem untested (have no need to use it for the moment)

==== Acer Aspire 1681 WLMI ====
* No wireless lan device is detected upon install, because of lack of ndiswrapper.
* No power management features seem to work properly at all. if i close the lid on my laptop, when i shut down the power isn't automatically cut off afterwards.
* Extra keys/multimedia keys don't work at all.
* Winmodem untested (have no need to use it for the moment)

==== Acer Aspire 1692 WLMI ====
* Great laptop but some problems with ACPI. Wifi works, but pressing the front button sometimes crashes it and you'll need to restart to work with it again.
* Beware to use kernels compiled for 686 and not 386 to get 1GB RAM support.
* Finally I managed to activate speedstep, battery level and suspend to RAM, but hibernating to disk requires a newer kernel with some patchs from <nowiki>[[http://www.suspend2.net/|swsusp]]</nowiki>. If somebody manages to make it work, please report!
* Need to install with 'noapic'
* Need to compile the <nowiki>[[http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm|intel compiler]]</nowiki>. Beware that flex is broken, you need the package 'flex-old'
* Download the <nowiki>[[http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/view.php?id=402|DSDT]]</nowiki> and compile it with the intel compiler. This one is a great DSDT and is tweaked so that there are no errors on 'dmesg'
* Copy the resulting file DSDT.aml to /etc/mkinitrd/DSDT and dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-whatsoever
* Hope this little HOWTO works!
* Update: I wrote a full review of the laptop and HOWTO in my blog. It's in Spanish, but as it's CC-licensed, you can translate it if you find it useful. HOWTO <nowiki>[[http://weblog.topopardo.com/archives/000270.html|here]]</nowiki>

==== Acer Aspire 2001 WLMI ====
* Everything except suspend works out of the box (CPU scaling, ipw2100 WLAN, sound, usb hotplug, graphics with dri)
* Special keys (volume, play/pause, mail, etc) work with hand-compiled acerhk driver and set using Computer->Desktop Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts
* Actually suspend seems to work, but resuming from s3 state cause laptop to lock-hard and requires reboot! Have tried everything I canthink of or find on net, will file in bugzilla.
* irda, cd & dvd burning not yet testedbut should work
* winmodem untested (have no need to use it)

==== Acer Aspire 3624 ====
* Wlan works out of box with 2.6.15 kernel, but no cpu freq adjustment or suspend to ram or disk.
* Cpu freq freq fixed by adding "p4_clockmod" to /etc/modules.
* Suspend problem fixed with 2.6.17 kernel, but no wifi. Solution: Install madwifi from source and add "ath_pci" to /etc/modules.

==== Acer Aspire 3633 ====
* Apart from the WLAN, the touch pad isn't configured well by default. Add this to /etc/X11/xorg.conf for scrolling support etc.:
<code>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "TouchPad"
        Driver          "synaptics"
        Option          "AlwaysCore"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"
        Option          "Protocol"              "auto-dev"
        Option  "LeftEdge"      "1700"
        Option  "RightEdge"     "5300"
        Option  "TopEdge"       "1700"
        Option  "BottomEdge"    "4200"
        Option  "FingerLow"     "25"
        Option  "FingerHigh"    "30"
        Option  "MaxTapTime"    "180"
        Option  "MaxTapMove"    "220"
        Option  "VertScrollDelta" "100"
        Option  "MinSpeed"      "0.09"
        Option  "MaxSpeed"      "0.18"
        Option  "AccelFactor"   "0.0015"
        Option  "SHMConfig"     "on"
EndSection
</code>
And add this in the ServerLayout section:
InputDevice     "TouchPad"

==== Acer Aspire 5002 WLMi ====
* Wide format display seems to cause installer to display text "wrapped" from the bottom back over top of display.
* Had to make minor edits to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf to specify "sis" instead of "vesa" as the display Driver.

==== Acer Aspire 5002 WLMi Hoary ====
* Bug : the 80x25 screen is displayed twice. Use 'linux vga=792' (1280x768*16Mo) in the installer.
* Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add 'vga=792' for a 1280x768*16Mo screen boot splash. The picture is then displayed using only 8 colors.
* Dollar and euro keys (located around the cursor pad) are not mapped.
* Screen is 1280x800
* Using the french install, the default keymap is Latin9,
* In Gnome, the Fn + left arrow set the computer to sleep mode instead of dimmering the screen light. Use the shortcut preferences panel to modify.
* Suspend to RAM and suspend to disk aren't working.

==== Acer Aspire 5002 WLMi Breezy Bager 32bit and 64 bit version ====
* Bug : the 80x25 screen is displayed twice. Use 'linux vga=792' (1280x768*16Mo) in the installer.
* Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add 'vga=792' for a 1280x768*16Mo screen boot splash. The picture is then displayed using only 8 colors.
* Dollar and euro keys (located around the cursor pad) are not mapped.
* Screen is 1280x800
* Using the french install, the default keymap is Latin9,
* Gnome : Fn + Left arrow, doesn't dimmer anymore.
* Suspend to RAM is working.
* Suspend to disk is not bugging (Pressing the Switch On button simply restart the Laptop from the beginning).
* Broadcom BCM4318 : Wifi needs ndiswrapper and Win 32 or 64 Broadcom driver (found on the acer support site). Bcm43xx module needs to be blacklisted in /etc/modprobe/blacklist. Network manager lists all access point, but seems unable to connect using password... Interface seems to be eth1 instead of wlan0.

==== Acer Aspire 5002 WLMi Feisty Fawn 32bit version ====
* No more issues during the Installation.
* Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add 'vga=792' for a 1280x768*16Mo screen boot splash.
* Dollar and euro keys (located around the cursor pad) are not mapped.
* Screen is 1280x800
* Using the french install, the default keymap is Latin9,
* Suspend to RAM and suspend to disk are working.
* Broadcom BCM4318 : the driver is still buggy. NetworkManager finds all acceess points, but won't connecte to any of them. Better use of ndiswrapper.

==== Acer Aspire 5024 WLMi ====
* No problems with install.  Widescreen 1280x800 worked "out of the box", as did most multimedia keys.
* To set up WLAN look this tutorial : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WiFiHowto/Acer5021WLMiConfiguration
* WLAN requires ndiswrapper, also <nowiki>[[http://www.archernar.co.uk/acer_acpi/acer_acpi_main.html|acer_acpi]]</nowiki> module to activate card under Breezy amd64. (shameless plug, sorry :)
* DVD has no DMA, requires edit to /etc/hdparm.conf
* Battery status detected perfectly.
* Suspend to disk/ram not work
* Powernow change frequency in steps 800/1600/1800 MHz
* No problem with IRDA
* For proprietary ati drivers in  Breezy AMD64 look on <nowiki>[[http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu]]</nowiki>. It works.
* export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32/ is needed for fireglcontrolpanel in  Breezy AMD64.
* Dual screen works (clone mode), TV output as well.

==== Acer Aspire 5504WXMi ====
* Use "noapic" during install.
* Will boot to blank screen after install. Press Ctrl-Alt-F1, and install the following packages <code>xorg-drivers-fglrx</code> (see InstallingSoftware). Gets 1024x768
* Download ATi Proprietary driver, use "sudo module-assistant prepare" "sudo chmod a-i fglrx" in folder with driver.

==== Acer 5612WLMi ====

* During installation, the screen turns out black (see this bug <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/41106]]</nowiki>). The solution is put vga=771 as parameter at the beginning
* No works:
*** The kernel detects wireless card (Intel Pro/Wireless 3945ABG network connection (Dual-band tri-mode 802.11a/b/g)) but gnome not see it (network manager does not show nothing and it not appears in net options in gnome)
*** X resolution is 1024x678 but in Xorg.conf file there is 1280x800 resolution. And it should be 1280x800 that is the real screen resolution. This bug is solved with the 915resolution program: <nowiki>[[http://www.geocities.com/stomljen/]]</nowiki> (a link to ubuntu wiki is here)
* Bluethooth works but I don't test it
* I want that the text resolution (console resolution at boot) were the maximum possible (1280x800) but I don't know if it's a bug or if it's consequence of graphical boot code

==== Acer Ferrari 3000 ====
* Installed with Hoary 5.04 and Warty 4.10. Both worked very well.
* No problems during the install
* WLAN nor modem have been tested.
* Everything else like soundcard, screen, touchpad, ethernetcard worked from start
* To get the bluetooth working I had to install that module into the kernel via Synaptic (and ordinary Ubuntu repositories)
* The special keys like open web browser did not work from start. I have not tried to activate them.

* Edgy:
** Installed from dapper upgrade and tested from live DVD
** All as with dapper, except that ACPI is now broken, <code>irqpoll</code> needs to be added to the end of the kernel command line to make it work.
** Flash reader now works.
* Dapper:
** Installed Dapper amd64 from DVD on a Ferrari 4005WMLi.
** Live X started and I got a blank black screen. (output is external only)
** Dropped down to console and added added <code>Option "MonitorLayout" "LVDS"</code> to the `Device` section of `xorg.conf`. `killall gdm; gdm`, and X started up fine.
** Synaptics touchpad needs better configuration: SynapticsTouchpadHowTo
** Networking works (although wifi needs bcm43xx firmware / ndiswrapper & driver)
** ACPI works (suspend, hibernate)
** Bluetooth works

===== Fixing what needs work =====

* Graphics

I recommend using 915resolution to hack the default values of this graphics card.

This software is hosted on the official repositories and a simple apt-get install 915resolution will install and configure
it for you.

Usage instructions are enough to understand how to use this application.

* Wifi LED

Create the file /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200.conf:

<code>sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200.conf</code>

And add this line:

<code>options ipw2200 led=1</code>

==== Acer Travelmate 4101WLMI ====
** Install: used noapic and install goes smooth
** Resolution: used 915resolution, found here http://www.freshnet.org/debian/hoary/915resolution_0.4.6-1_i386.deb
*** run 915resolution 5c 1280 800
*** had to edit my xorg.conf, as refresh rate was set to high on the Modeline, changed from 83 to 60
*** restart X
*** if successful run 915resolution before X starts on boot up
** Battery status was done by recompiling the DSDT
*** find fixed DSDT.aml here: http://www.rrdesign.ca/
*** copy fixed DSDT.aml to /etc/mkinitramfs
*** run: mkinitramfs -o <somefilename>
*** copy <somefilename> to /boot
*** edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
*** change line: initrd to initrd /boot/<somefilename> Note: may want to duplicate a grub entry so you still have the good one.
*** Reboot
** For the front WLAN LED, ipw2200 module has to be loaded with: modprobe ipw2200 led=1, then it works fine.
** So far other than Suspend/Hibernate(the screen blanks but thats it), everything is working fine, wireless, ethernet, sound, etc.

==== Acer Travelmate 4150LCi (with Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger) ====

* Both Breezy installer CD and Breezy live CD are unable to mount the DVD drive. Immediately after the keyboard language selection, the installer fails the montage of the DVD drive.
* When installing from a external CD drive, the previous problem is circumvent but the installation fails at the Hard Drive montage stage.

==== Acer Travelmate 4150LCi (with Ubuntu 6.06, 7.10 and 8.04) ====
* Almost everything works out-of-the-box.
* Tested:
** Sound
** Video (only has 800x600 resolution)
** PCMCIA
** Wireless
** Ethernet
* Not tested:
** MIDI
** 56K Modem
** Firewire
* Tested and not working:
** Cardreader
** IrDA

==== Acer Travelmate 4501LCi ====

* Sound works, but no midi. Haven't really looked into it, though
* Lan and wlan work right out of the box, LED for wifi works by adding the following text into a file     called ipw2200.conf in /etc/modprobe.d/  options ipw2200 led=1
* Custom keys can be assigned in keyboard shorcuts
* Speedstep works very well, but the battery indicator doesn't seem to work
* Suspend untested (ToDo)
* IrDA untested
* Modem untested
* Cardreader untested
* PCMCIA untested
* Everythings else works right out of the box without any problems. So the only real problem is the battery indicator

==== Acer Travelmate 4651LMi on Dapper ====

* Sound works
* Lan and wlan work right out of the box after installing lineak and acerhk
* Custom keys can be assigned in keyboard shorcuts
* Speedstep works very well
* Suspend to RAM works but not to HDD
* IrDA works
* Modem works with sl-modem-daemon installed (software modem) and kernel module snd_intel8x0m
* Cardreader not working
* PCMCIA works
* For more details check <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-AcerTravelmate4651LMi]]</nowiki>

==== Acer Travelmate 2200 ====

* The keyboard and mouse doesnt work, to make them work you will need to disable the Legasy USB Support in the BIOS.
*** Select 'F2' while powering up. Look for the biso setting: Legasy USB Support <Enabled>
*** Change this to <Disabled>
*** Save, power down. Re power up.
* ACPI doesnt work, to make it work you will have to use a custom dsdt table in order to make it work. You can get a working dsdt table from here: http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/index.php  There are also instructions to apply the custom dsdt. Using the custom dsdt, the PCMCIA works just fine.

* Sound also doesnt work out of the box, a manual to make it work can be found here: http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#configuresoundproperly

==== Acer Travelmate 2403 ====

* To perform installation, need to boot with:

linux noapic nolapic

* To use the 1280x800 resolution with X.org

 - install 855resolution

 - edit /etc/default/855resolution and set:

MODE=54

XRESO=1280

YRESO=800

* The intel chipset 910GML is not supported yet. So video acceleration does not work. It is too slow to read a DVD.

* Tested successfully: sound, ethernet, usb mouse

==== Acer Travelmate 8003 ====

* Everything except suspend/standby works out of the box (speedstepping, Intel IPW2200 WLAN, bluetooth)
* Win modem works.  Install sl-modem-daemon package and if you have Linux kernel 2.6 then there is no need to build any modules.
* IrDA untested, DVD-Burner untested, but should work
* special keys such as 'Volume down/up' and 'Acer-Launchkeys' can be assigned as shortcuts in Computer -> Desktop Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts

Subject: Acer Aspire 1510
Message-ID: <20050520190409+0100@https://www.ubuntulinux.org>

Use 'live vga=791'  to boot with correct screen resolution, update should sort out any other shortfalls - suspect acpi will not work due to bios bug in this model see -
http://casteyde.christian.free.fr/laptop/LinuxOnAspire1511LMi.html  for more info

==== Acer Travelmate 4101WLMI ====

* Installation: Installation hangs, but worked when I used acpi=off. Later (see below), I discovered that pci=noacpi should be used instead. Later, discovered that noapic is even better - sound and networking work fully.
* Resolution:
** This is a 1280x800 (widescreen/WXGA) screen, but System/Preferences/Screen Resolution only offers 1024x768 at 60Hz.
** Tried adding HorizSync and VertRefresh to /etc/X11/xorg.conf as described here:
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
    No noticeable effect.
** Tried using 855resolution.
    That does give me the extra resolution choice in System/Preferences/Screen Resolution but the screen then becomes scrollable instead of all fitting into the screen at the higher resolution.
* The battery applet does not work, obviously because ACPI is disabled. Suspend also does not work, probably for the same reason.

==== Acer Travelmate 8104WLMI ====

* Installation: Installation hangs, but worked when I used "noapic" option. Need to add "Option "MonitorLayout" "LVDS, AUTO"" in Section "Device"
   of xorg.conf (see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=191715#post191715) cause blank screen at first boot (I switched to console with
   CTRL+ALT+F1 and modified xorg.conf with vi editor).
* Resolution: It's better to use 1680*1050, no problems detected.
* LAN and WLAN work right out of the box, I've enabled led with this command: echo "options ipw2200 led=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200. (You can set
   WLAN configuration using Gnome network configuration tool, it supports also WEP authentication).
* Special keys work right out of the box after changing keyboard layout to "acer_tm_800" (you can edit xorg.conf and add line
   Option "XkbLayout" "acer_tm_800" to your input device / keyboard section) and using Gnome shortcuts editor to assign a function to them.
* ACPI: ACPI partially works. I've put a patched DSDT table (3c22 custom) in folder /etc/mkinitramfs and linked it to kernel with command
   "dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-(uname -r)" (this table works well with 1024MB RAM models, if you have a 512MB one, you can try DSDT table that
   I've attached to this thread: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=98413). With this patch you can read battery state, you can control
   CPU frequency and read CPU temperature. Unfortunately none of standby, suspend-to-ram or suspend-to-disk are working for me. System hangs and I
   have to hard reset it. (I've tryed with ati driver that come with Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy and fglrx driver until version 8.20.8).
* Graphic driver: ati driver that come with Ubuntu (or Kubuntu) 5.10 Breezy works well but without hardware accelleration or TV-Out. FGLRX driver
   works but when I switch to console (CTRL+Alt+F1) screen starts melting strange colors and I have to reset with CTRL+Alt+Del. It seems that with
   kernel 2.6.15-rc5 this problem has gone but sometime system freeze when I restart it.
* In conclusion my system is functional, but I really need standby, suspend-to-ram and suspend-to-disk. I will try software "Suspend2" hoping to
   solve problem. I will let you know.
* Sound works, I only unmuted device.
* Modem untested
* Cardreader untested
* PCMCIA untested
* IrDA untested
* Bluetooth is recognized, but untested.

===== Fixing what needs work =====

* Graphics

When trying to boot into the GNOME, I always ended with a black screen with nothing on it. I knew I was already
logged into GNOME because of the welcome sound.

In order to get GUI so you can proceed with the installation, you will need to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Press CTRL+ALT+F1, to get you text mode:

sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Locate the [Device] section and add this line to the bottom of it:

<code>Option "MonitorLayout" "LVDS,Auto"</code>

You're done editing. Press CTRL+O (letter O, not number zero) to save changes (with nano) or ESC and :wq if you're using vi

Press CTRL+ALT+F7 to get back to the GUI mode followed by CTRL+ALT+Backspace to restart the X server.

* SD/MMC Card Reader

At the time of this writting SDHCI is already standard on the Kernel.
In order to get the SD and MMC card reader, you just have to load to the kernel itself,
using 'modprobe'.

<code>modprobe sdhci</code>

Now, I wish this would make it work 100%, but it doesn't. I have tried several hacks
to get it to work like I want it (mount and umount / detect card while logged in) but with
no success.

Restart the computer with the card enside the reader. It should be mounted and a shortcut on
the Desktop.

* Wifi LED

Create the file /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200.conf:

<code>sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200.conf</code>

And add this line:

<code>options ipw2200 led=1</code>

==== Acer Travelmate 4651LCi ====

* Installation: Installation hangs, but worked when I used "noapic" option. Nearly everything works out of the box.
* Resolution: 1280x1024, 1400x1050: install 855resolution
* Modem (winmodem) untested, shall work with slmodem and a commercial driver
* Cardreader unsupported by kernel (at east up to kernel 2.6.14)
* hibernate (aka suspend to disk) does not work with the shipped swsusp (hangs on resume). on debian sarge suspend2 worked, so i guess <nowiki>[[http://www.suspend2.net|suspend2]]</nowiki> on ubuntu should work too (needs kenrel patches to be applied).
