| Lexmark X215, Samsung SCX-4216F and Xerox PE 16 appears to be the same printer. Download the SCX-4216F drivers from Samsung site and run installation program. This will install a configuration program and make the driver available in the CUPS printer setup. Printing works fine over smb and socks, haven't tested scanning. - See page http://www.samsung.com/us/support/do...p_nm=SCX-4216F - Download driver from http://org.downloadcenter.samsung.co...xDriver.tar.gz - Download and extract the driver. Execute installation program in Terminal: $ sudo cdroot/autorun Choose driver from a list and install

| Manufacturer:Generic, Model:PCL6/PCL X printer, Driver:lj5grey
| No
| Yes
| v6.06 (Dapper)
| Printer looks for DHCP server and works perfectly over a network (printer has inbuilt print server). To print from Adobe Reader change printing command from /usr/bin/lp to /usr/bin/lpr -YourPrinterName. www.linuxprinting.org suggest using the pxl mono driver but I found this stalled certain PDF print jobs - I use lj5grey and has fixed the problem. Quality and speed good. Could not get Lexmark proprietary drivers to work- you don't need it for this printer anyway.
