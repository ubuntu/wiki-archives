Marketing Ubuntu out in the real world means getting face-to-face with real people and talking to them. There are a couple of things you can do do market Ubuntu, publicize your LoCo Team or an event that you will be hosting. 

== Flyering/Postering ==
Handing out fliers and putting up posters might not be enough to get someone to go and get Ubuntu on their own, but it does raise awareness about Ubuntu, Linux, Free Software, and Digital Freedom. That's important. 

* See the <nowiki>[[MarketingTeam/Materials|materials]]</nowiki> available from the marketing team or create your own and submit them.
