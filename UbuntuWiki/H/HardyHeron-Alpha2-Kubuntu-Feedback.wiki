* Overall it is nice.  But is there any plan to improve Adept.  It is no where near Synaptic.  It doesn't display several apt-get confirmation messages, slower at searching package index, lacks facility to remove unnecessary packages which were installed along with others which have been removed now.
* absolutely great, nice ideas, i am really keen on trying the kopete-flashlight ;-) -- Malvin
* best kubuntu to date! wow! can't wait to get my hands on the final release though that's still a couple of months away :-)  one issue though - I downloaded alpha 1 originally and kept updating (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade) the tasty menu never showed up. In the end people upgrading from gutsy might experience the same issue or maybe it's just me that ran into it ... but that's a minor "problem"! -- ANDREA
* Just doing it live with Alpha 2. It works on this computer unlike anything later than Edgy (thanks to TTY SATA/IDE etc. problem)! The updated window decoration looks good, better than Gutsy's. I can"t see the tasty menu either? It needs to be enabled somewhere? But so far very good, 2nd Alpha, better than I expected! But with the bug gone (hopefully and apparently) that Feisty and Gutsy has is the greatest news! -- ToniHelenius  * I tried the Live CD, and in the K menu / Lost & Found there are a lot of applications:

   and if I open Kcontrol, the applications list is empty! --francesko

* I let my parents install Hardy Alpha2 from LiveCD on our old laptop and jot down the most important obstacles/confusions:
*** During the installation we formatted the complete disk, and (because it is still a running LiveCD) a popup appeared over all windows "new media found" - no one knows what to do there.
*** We had no internet connection during installation, so a message came up "Cannot access http://security.ubuntu.com", and as a result ALL package sources where commented in /etc/apt/sources.list
*** At the end of install process one is asked to restart the computer, but there is only an Okay button. An additonal restart button would be great
*** The whole partitioning menu was a bit confusing, even I expected sth different behind the various options and had to try&error
*** The whole installation process needs a bit more explanation, like "what do we want to do here (like time zone, partioning) and why)
*** language selection & installation is tricky in general. I discovered that nice language-selector-qt tool, but it is nowhere in the K-Menu, and only magic knows why the exec is called qt-language-selector.
*** calling "kcontrol" directly doesn't work!
*** I personally don't like the standard empty folders Music/Pictures/templates/... but I guess there already was a big discussion on that :-)
*** Well, that's all! Everything else works fine till now. Great job as always, thx guys! Hope these comments helped someone -- AlphaBlue52

Some notes from VeGeek:
 1. It will be better to add KVpnc - not all users can configure VPN by hand. Or try to do something with Network Manager.
 2. Oh, it isn`t possible to configure routes in System Settings, it`s simple to configure them in /etc/network/interfaces, but not all users can do it.
 3. GUIDance`s DisplayConfig still sucks... It will be better to replace it with hm... KXgenerator.

I also noticed all the programs in Lost & Found - and in fact, they were there before the install - they were present on the LiveCD.  Couple of other points:
1. During the install it asked me if I wanted to mount the newly formatted hard drive.  I clicked no and it finished the install just fine.  I never noticed any offer to mount before and I assume it's wrong.
2. When I first logged in, the adept-updater wanted to download and install a bunch of packages.  It downloaded them but wouldn't install (it gave a message that installing would break packages).  When I tried an apt-get upgrade from the command line, it gave this error:
  E: Internal Error, Could not perform immediate configuration (2) on libstdc++6
To get it to install I had to do 
  sudo apt-get install libstdc++6
which worked, and then the sudo apt-get upgrade worked after that.
3. I don't know if this is a problem or not, but it sounds like it should eventually be fixed.. I saw this during the upgrade:
  Preparing to replace nvidia-kernel-common 20051028+1ubuntu7 (using .../nvidia-kernel-common_20051028+1ubuntu8_all.deb) ...
