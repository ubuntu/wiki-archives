== Setting up Hangul (Korean) Input on Ubuntu ==

''Disclaimer: I'm _really_ not experienced with this, but since this instruction was missing, I decided to at least give a pointer to a working guide. Feel free to improve.''

Please see <nowiki>[[http://www.scim-im.org/wiki/documentation/installation_and_configuration/ubuntu_kubuntu|SCIM's wiki page on setting up Hangul Input on (K)Ubuntu]]</nowiki>

After following that guide (and restarting X: log out; press Ctrl-Alt-Backspace; log in), you should be able to press Ctrl-space and get a window where you can choose an input method.
