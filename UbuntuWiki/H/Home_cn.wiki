==== Get Involved ====

If you want to help contribute to Ubuntu, then you’ve come to the right place. Keep reading to learn how.

You have just taken your first step toward getting involved. Before you get started, we ask that you please observe the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki>. It’s not very long and it will help you get started.

Once that’s done, check out our <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community|community page]]</nowiki>.

==== Teams ====

The <nowiki>[[Teams]]</nowiki> page contains a listing of the various Community Teams, their responsibilities, links to their Wiki Home Pages and leaders, communication tools, and a quick reference to let you know whether and when they hold meetings.

Most Teams’ Wiki Home Pages provide information about who they are, what they do, when their meetings are, and how to contact them. Using these pages, teammates are able to communicate and coordinate projects.

==== Governance and Membership ====

Like most communities, we have our <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|rules]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/governance|governing body]]</nowiki>.

Anyone can join and participate in most, if not all, of our Teams and Projects. But if you want an “@ubuntu.com” e-mail address, it has to be earned. Find out how in our <nowiki>[[Membership]]</nowiki> section.

==== Community Links ====

As an active member of our community, you probably should check out what else is going on in the world of Ubuntu:

* <nowiki>[[http://fridge.ubuntu.com/|The Fridge]]</nowiki> posts all the latest News and Upcoming Events.

* <nowiki>[[http://planet.ubuntu.com/|Planet Ubuntu]]</nowiki> is a collection of community blogs.
