__TOC__

My name is Valentin. I am from Bulgaria. I am currently 17 and I am interested in computers. Mainly software and a bit hardware. I am planing on studying computer science in a university in the UK.

I have some experience in webdesign and web administration. I had two websites built by me. I know HTML and some PHP&MySql (I can read code and handle it in a good way but cannot write compicated scripts). I also have some experience in 3D animation. I have worked with 3DS Max, V-ray and Mental Ray. At the moment I am studying Blender.

Area of interest: not yet sure
