'''About Me'''

Hello I am Hiren Gandhi. I took my first steps into the Linux world officially with the Ubuntu 12.04 release 2 years ago. I have been using Precise, until recently when I switched to Ubuntu Gnome 14.04, because I wanted ubuntu with gnome shell. Prior to release of ubuntu gnome 14.04, I was passively contributing by iso testing mostly the daily builds and beta 2 milestone.

'''Goal'''

I wish to continue to help test future Ubuntu Gnome releases and help find bugs, as I am now a regular user of this system. This will also allow me to see what I will be using in the future :D
