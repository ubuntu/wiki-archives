Welcome to the Ubuntu HardwareSupport wiki page. Here are your current choices for Hardware Support information:

=== Current Programme ===

<nowiki>[[File:ubuntu-certified.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/certified/|Ubuntu Certified]]</nowiki> is a programme where OEMs submit systems to Canonical's testing facility where certification testing and validation is performed by Canonical engineers.

=== Discontinued Programmes ===

==== Ubuntu Friendly ====

<nowiki>[[File:ubuntu-friendly.png]]</nowiki>

Ubuntu Friendly was an open hardware validation programme for desktops, netbooks and laptops, allowing us to validate systems that are known to work well with a particular release of Ubuntu as "Ubuntu Friendly". ''This programme was started during the Oneiric 11.10 cycle and finished in 2013.''

==== Hardware Support Wiki ====

The Ubuntu Community used to contribute to a table of hardware that has been tested. This was phased out in preference for the Ubuntu Friendly programme. However, if you were looking for this information, you can find it here:

The Ubuntu Ready programme has been discontinued. You can view the <nowiki>[[http://web.archive.org/web/20150102121326/https://ubuntu.com/certification/ready|archive of hardware]]</nowiki> that got certified as Ubuntu Ready.

=== Other Resources ===

==== Ubuntu Forums ====

Ubuntu works on a range of hardware which has not been certified by the manufacturer. The Ubuntu community works together to test and report the range of systems and components that work with Ubuntu. You can see the latest reports from community members and contribute to the list in the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=135|Forums]]</nowiki>.

==== DB of successful installations ====

One can share Ubuntu installation experience automatically by <nowiki>[[Hardware_probe]]</nowiki> or search for similar configurations from other users in the case of hardware compatibility problems.
