Ubuntu Installation Help
----
The purpose of this guide is to fix the slow boot up time and the need for user interaction with the touch-pad during the installation of Ubuntu. I'd recommend using the Alternate installer, it's much faster and seems more stable.

'''Install'''

You should append "nohz=off" to the boot options when booting from the USB drive. Otherwise, it will be too slow and require user input throughout.

'''Kernel Boot Fix'''

As of kernel 2.6.31-18, there have been problems relating to speed and the system intermittently freezing. By default, the NB 200 (and other related models such as the NB 205) sometimes freeze and suffer from low performance due to a power-saving feature of the Linux kernel. Dramatic speed increases have been noted with this feature disabled (boot speeds increased by 20 seconds). If you wish, this feature can be disabled.

To disable the kernel feature (if using the GRUB2 bootloader), use a text editor as root to open the file: /etc/default/grub

Add "nohz=off" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT

It should look like:
<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nohz=off"
</pre>

Then run the following from the Terminal to complete the fix:

<code>sudo update-grub</code>

A reboot will be required to apply the change.

'''Bootup time'''

The boot time is with the default settings horrendously slow. A simple change in the BIOS will speed up the boot time to less than 30 seconds. 
* Press F2 on machine boot to enter the BIOS
* Select the 'Advanced' tab
* Change SATA controller mode from AHCI to Compatibility
