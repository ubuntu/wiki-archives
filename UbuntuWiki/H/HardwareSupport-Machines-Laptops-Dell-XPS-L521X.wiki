=== Introduction ===

This page should give some information you need about running Ubuntu on a '''Dell XPS 15 L521x''' laptop (2012/2013).

=== Installation gotcha's ===

* You need to set the ATA controller to AHCI (not smart response) to get Ubuntu to boot.
* As of 13.10 Ubuntu doesn't support Rapid Start, this should also be disabled in bios or else computer will wake up from suspend after awhile and fail to shut down, eating up battery.

=== Hardware ===
==== Optimus / Graphics cards ====
By default the Nvidia is working, not sure about disabling for power management.

==== 9-in-1 card reader ====
It works on 13.10

==== Trackpad ====
Works on 13.10.
Full multi-gesture (2 points) trackpad usage work at this moment. Three-finger tap can be configured easily.

Rarely the touchpad may get stuck after suspend-resume, if so you can Ctrl+Alt+T to get a terminal, and run:

sudo rmmod psmouse

sudo modprobe psmouse
