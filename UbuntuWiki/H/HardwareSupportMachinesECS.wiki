ECS has a line of laptops or "mobile desktops" with Intel Pentium or Transmeta Crusoe based models. Currently, only the ECS Desknote A530+ has been tested with Ubuntu -- Summary of features and things that work below. Mostly all of the hardware in the system appear to have been detected upon install time and by the LiveCD -- this is true so far as Ubuntu v5.04 (Hoary Hedgehog) is concerned.
