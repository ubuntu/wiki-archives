== Logitech Webcam Support ==

You can check if your Web Camera is supported in Linux by looking at the <nowiki>[[http://www.quickcamteam.net/devices/|official compatibility]]</nowiki> list on the Logitech website. Linux support does not guarantee support for your webcam in Ubuntu.

| After compilation of the module using <nowiki>[[http://packages.ubuntu.com/hoary/misc/qc-usb-source|qc-usb-source]]</nowiki>
| 
| Make sure the build-essential package and the correct linux-headers package are installed. Install the package qc-usb-source, uncompress the archive /usr/src/qc-usb-modules.tar.gz and execute /usr/src/modules/qc-usb-source/quickcam.sh (Note: The driver is reliable and included in other distributions like Mandriva, it could be included in Ubuntu as well)

| Not out of the box, but can be made to work.
| 
| Warty and Hoary both detect and load the ov511 driver included with the kernel, but neglect to load the image decompressor kernel module. This is evidenced in dmesg by the line "drivers/usb/media/ov511.c: No decompressor available." To get things running, load the kernel module "ovcamchip" at startup. Driver home page is http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/, and problem solution is from <nowiki>[[https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2004-July/msg03162.html|here]]</nowiki>.
