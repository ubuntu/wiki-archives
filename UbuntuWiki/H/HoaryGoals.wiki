gstreamer0.8-ffmpeg gets me mpeg here in totem, but not divx or xvid or avi or such.  I guess it's just a matter of locating, testing, and enabling gstreamer plug-ins.  Could always go totem-xine, but i'm more interested in the unification of video, not dessemination of it.  Make a gstreamer-xine/gstreamer-mplayer plug-in or such maybe in the future, a goal for upstream gnome.  That'd be quite a task.
