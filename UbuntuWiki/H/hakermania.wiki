== About Me ==
I began using Ubuntu after a blue screen of death that caused data loss using Windows XP. Ubuntu was the ideal operating system for me: It was helpful for my everyday tasks and helped me discover my passion for programming.

My first Ubuntu was 9.10 and, after the release of 10.04 I am finding myself in ubuntuforums.org. What initially attracted me to Ubuntu was the awesome compiz effects, like wobbly windows! Unity was hard to become used to, but it is now very useful and quick, mainly because of HUD. A sad fact is that the main Ubuntu system has become a lot heavier, though.

==== General ====

I love programming and spent most of my free time hanging out, reading books and programming.

== Professional Work ==
I am not a professional, I am still a student. I am one of the developers of <nowiki>[[http://wall-changer.sourceforge.net/|Wallch]]</nowiki>, though, an application for changing the wallpapers of the desktop background on a set time. The latest 2 versions of Wallch have been included to the main repositories.
