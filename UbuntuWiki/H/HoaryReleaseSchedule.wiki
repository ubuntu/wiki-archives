Just a thought - maybe a color key would be helpful on this page? I see green, tan, pink and red cells. I can guess at the meaning of green and red (but I could be wrong), and have no idea what the other colors represent.

The colors seem to get darker as they get closer to the release date, so I would assume that they are merely indicators of the impending release date itself.

The colours indicate the current level of freeze.
