=== Summary ===

Compiling with PIE (Position Independent Executable) provides some hardening against memory corruption vulnerabilities.  On architectures with enough general registers, compiling with PIE does not incur a noticeable performance impact. As a result, the added security is worth having.

=== Release Note ===

The 64bit x86 architecture is compiled with PIE (Position Independent Executable) by default.  Combined with the kernel's ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), this provides some additional protections against memory corruption vulnerabilities being exploited by attackers.

=== Rationale ===

This should cover the _why_: why is this change being proposed, what justifies it, where we see this justified.

=== Use Cases ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

You can have subsections that better describe specific parts of the issue.

=== Implementation ===

This section should describe a plan of action (the "how") to implement the changes discussed. Could include subsections like:

==== UI Changes ====

Should cover changes required to the UI, or specific UI that is required to implement this

==== Code Changes ====

Code changes should include an overview of what needs to change, and in some cases even the specific details.

==== Migration ====

Include:
* data migration, if any
* redirects from old URLs to new ones, if any
* how users will be pointed to the new way of doing things, if necessary.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

To experiment with this, the <nowiki>[[PIEExperimentSpec]]</nowiki> wiki page exists to organize the work of rebuilding Intrepid with PIE enabled by default.

=== Outstanding Issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Use this section to take notes during the BoF; if you keep it in the approved spec, use it for summarising what was discussed and note any options that were rejected.
