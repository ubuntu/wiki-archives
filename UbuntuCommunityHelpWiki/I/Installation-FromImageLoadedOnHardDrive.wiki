== Introduction ==

To install on a computer without a CD or DVD drive or network and a BIOS that forbids booting from USB, it may be possible to take the hard drive out and load a CD image onto it with Unetbootin.

== Installation Steps ==

# Download Live CD ISO image.
# Download and install <nowiki>[[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net|Unetbootin]]</nowiki> to a working computer
# Create and extra "installer" partition (on the HDD) in addition to the partitions needed for the OS
# Use Unetbootin to put the iso file on the "installer" partition and make it bootable
# Install HDD into computer, boot up the computer and cross fingers
# If computer boots up to the Unetbootin menu, chose the option to check CD integrity.
# If integrity check returns no errors, let the machine reboot and chose either the "Try OS" or "Install OS" options.
