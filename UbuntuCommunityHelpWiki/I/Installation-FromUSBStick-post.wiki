== Postrequisites - restore the USB stick ==

'Postrequisites' - after installation: how to restore the USB stick to a standard storage drive. The standard is an MSDOS partition table (MBR) and a partition with the FAT32 file system.

=== gparted ===

In order to re-use the stick after installing Ubuntu, just format it completely (including MBR) using '''gparted''' in Ubuntu or Disk Management in Windows. This works in most cases.

Otherwise, see details in this link: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Win32DiskImager/iso2usb/FormatHelp]]</nowiki>

'''gparted''' comes with the iso file but is available only in the live system. You install it into an installed system with

<pre>
sudo apt-get install gparted
</pre>

=== Disks alias gnome-disks ===

Sometimes Disks works where gparted fails, for example to unmount the drive after using the Startup Disk Creator.

=== mkusb - works where other tools fail to restore a USB flash drive ===

'''mkusb''' with a GUI and '''mkusb-nox''' in text mode have built-in features to wipe the first megabyte, create a new partition table and file system. This makes it work where other tools get confused by some data near the head end of the drive.

If you run standard Ubuntu, you need  an extra instruction to get the repository Universe. (Kubuntu, Lubuntu ... Xubuntu have the repository Universe activated automatically.)

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository universe  # only for standard Ubuntu
</pre>
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa  # and press Enter
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mkusb
</pre>
and if you want also the command line version without graphics
<pre>
sudo apt-get install mkusb-nox
</pre>
