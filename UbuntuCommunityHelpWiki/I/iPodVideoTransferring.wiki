== Transferring Videos to the iPod Video ==

Depending on the version of Ubuntu you are using, to get movies onto your iPod Video, you may need to compile and install mpeg4ip and latest version of <nowiki>[[http://www.gtkpod.org|gtkpod]]</nowiki>. If you are running Gutsy or above, you do not need to follow this.  Merely install the 'gtkpod-aac' package and have fun!

Alternatively, there is an video ipod specific application called <nowiki>[[http://thinliquidfilm.org|thinliquidfilm]]</nowiki> that will encode and transfer videos to your ipod,  and can create new video playlists, or transfer your videos to an existing video playlist.  mpeg4ip and gtkpod are not required for <nowiki>[[http://thinliquidfilm.org|thinliquidfilm]]</nowiki>.  See towards the end of this guide for more information on <nowiki>[[http://thinliquidfilm.org|thinliquidfilm]]</nowiki>.

If you need more information, make sure to check out the <nowiki>[[iPodVideo|iPod Video wiki page]]</nowiki>, as well as the <nowiki>[[iPodVideoEncoding|Guide to Encoding Video for the iPod Video]]</nowiki>.

=== Compiling and Installing mpeg4ip ===
* '''Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake)'''
   If you are using Ubuntu 6.06 then you can skip this step.
* '''Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger)'''
   First, you need to remove faac capabilities from your machine temporarily (they'll be reinstalled later).  You'll also need to ensure that you have checkinstall installed on your system for the installation process.<<BR>>
   Remove following packages
*** libmp4v2-0
*** libmp4v2-dev
*** faac
*** gstreamer0.8-faac
*** libfaac0
*** libfaac-dev
   Install following packages
*** checkinstall
*** build-essential
*** libtool
*** libsdl1.2-dev

   After this step, there are two ways that you can load mpeg4ip onto your system. If you'd like the newest packages or are familiar with compiling programs from source, you can use the source method. If you'd like an easy install and are not familiar with compiling from source, use the .deb method.

==== The .deb Method -- Recommended for those not familiar with compiling from source ====

   The source for the .deb is currently down.

==== The Source Method -- Recommended for advanced users who are familiar with compiling from source ====

   First, you need to grab the latest mpeg4ip version. As of this posting, that's version 1.5.0.1, and it can be found <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=18676|here]]</nowiki>.

If you don't feel like doing that and want it all in the terminal:

<pre>
wget http://umn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mpeg4ip/mpeg4ip-1.5.0.1.tar.gz
</pre>

Next, unpack it and configure it:

<pre>
tar -xzf mpeg4ip-1.5.0.1.tar.gz
cd mpeg4ip-1.5.0.1
./bootstrap --disable-server
sudo mkdir /usr/local/include
sudo cp mpeg4ip_config.h /usr/local/include
sudo cp include/mpeg4ip.h include/mpeg4ip_version.h /usr/local/include
./configure
sed -i "s/SUBDIRS = \. test util/SUBDIRS = \./" lib/mp4v2/Makefile
make
sudo checkinstall -D make install
</pre>

   Again, make sure you change the name (option #2) to just mpeg4ip when prompted.  Once that's finished, mpeg4ip is now configured.

=== Installing gtkpod v0.99.x ===
* '''Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake)'''
   Install package 'gtkpod-aac' from Multiverse repository.
* '''Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger)'''
   Next, you have to compile the latest version of gtkpod (0.99.4 as of this posting).

   First, we need to install the XML Parser of Perl. You'll need to make sure you meet dependencies before you can do that.<<BR>>
   Install following packages
*** libexpat1-dev
*** libglade2-0
*** libglade2-dev
*** flex
*** libid3tag0
*** libid3tag0-dev
*** libxml-parser-perl

   Now we need to install libgpod. If you do not want to runt he wget, you can find other mirrors <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67873|here]]</nowiki>.

<pre>
wget http://umn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gtkpod/libgpod-0.3.2.tar.gz
tar -xzf libgpod-0.3.2.tar.gz
cd libgpod-0.3.2/
./configure
make
sudo checkinstall -D make install
</pre>

   Next, you need to copy some libraries to /usr/lib

<pre>
sudo cp /usr/local/lib/libgpod* /usr/lib
</pre>

   Then, you can grab gtkpod <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67873|here]]</nowiki>. Or, if you want to use wget, you can run:

<pre>
wget http://easynews.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gtkpod/gtkpod-0.99.4.tar.gz
</pre>

   Now, we need to untar it, configure, and install it:

<pre>
tar -xzf gtkpod-0.99.4.tar.gz
cd gtkpod-0.99.4
./configure
make
sudo checkinstall -D make install
</pre>

   Make sure you change the name to gtkpod when prompted (and not gtkpod-0.99.4).

   Now, we get to reinstall aac support by installing following packages:
*** libmp4v2-0
*** libmp4v2-dev
*** faac
*** gstreamer0.8-faac
*** libfaac0
*** libfaac-dev

gtkpod is now able to accept videos.  Just add them like you would mp3's.

=== Screenshot ===

Here's what gtkpod looks like once you've got it all up and running, with videos transferred:

<nowiki>[[File:gtkpod-vids.png]]</nowiki>

Notice I made a playlist just for Video.  You don't have to, but it helps organize things.  Just click on the Add Files button, select the .mov that you want to transfer to the iPod, and then you're all set.

=== Transfer Videos To Your Ipod Using thinliquidfilm ===

You can also transfer videos to your ipod using <nowiki>[[http://thinliquidfilm.org|thinliquidfilm]]</nowiki>.  thinliquidfilm is a gui which encodes and transfers videos to a video ipod.  thinliquidfilm has a number of dependencies.  It depends on ffmpeg, compiled with support for xvid and h264 codecs (see the <nowiki>[[iPodVideoEncoding|Encoding Video for the iPod Video]]</nowiki> guide for more detail on this).  It also depends on pyqt.  This is included in the '''kubuntu-desktop''' package.  In addition, for ipod transfer support, you will need to install the '''libgpod0''' and '''python-gpod''' packages.

Installation is very simple with the included installation script.  There is comprehensive installation and usage documentation on the <nowiki>[[http://thinliquidfilm.org|website]]</nowiki>, and therefore, there is no point in repeating that information here.  You can see a screenshot of thinliquidfilm <nowiki>[[http://thinliquidfilm.org/images/screenie2.png|here]]</nowiki>.

* Note: To make videos in the correct format, make sure you check out <nowiki>[[iPodVideoEncoding|Encoding Video for the iPod Video]]</nowiki>.
