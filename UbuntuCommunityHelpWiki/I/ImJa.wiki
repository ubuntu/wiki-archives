== im-ja ==

=== Why im-ja instead of SCIM ===

Features im-ja has over scim:
* faster
* more configurable
* can use a number of backends
* simpler to install and use

Also, SCIM contains many bugs which are not likely to be fixed any time soon, whereas im-ja just works.  For example, I tried entering the text "nihongo" with SCIM and I got back a mish-mash of Kanji, hiragana and latin characters, whereas with im-ja it immediately converts my typing into hiragana, and will select an appropriate sequence of kanji upon pressing space.  See this <nowiki>[[http://pdr.cx/scim_vs_im-ja.png|illustration of scim and im-ja use]]</nowiki>.

=== Installing ===

The im-ja homepage is at <nowiki>[[http://im-ja.sourceforge.net/|http://im-ja.sourceforge.net/]]</nowiki>.  Ubuntu packages can be installed using gdebi from <nowiki>[[http://im-ja.sourceforge.net/binary.html|http://im-ja.sourceforge.net/binary.html]]</nowiki>.  You will also need to install a wnn server.  This can be done with the following command:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install freewnn-jserver
</pre>

You may also need to add the following two lines to <code>/etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules</code> if they're not already there:

<pre>
"/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0/immodules/im-ja.so"
"im-ja" "Japanese" "gtk+" "/usr/share/locale" "ja"
</pre>

Check that this is the right path for im-ja as it may have been updated since writing this documentation.

=== Using ===

Any newly-launched GTK+ program will now have "Japanese" listed as an input method.  You can select this by right clicking on a text entry and selecting Input Method -> Japanese.

Type away and your text will be input at first in hiragana.  This can then be converted to an appropriate representation by pressing the space bar.
