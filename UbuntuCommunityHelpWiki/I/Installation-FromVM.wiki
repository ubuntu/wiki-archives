After trying to get an installation of Xubuntu on a laptop with boot support only for a floppy and USB 1.0, I found an alternative.  I have not had a problem with UUIDs yet.

== What is needed ==
* A method to hook up your disk drive to another computer (connected via USB->IDE/SATA / directly via IDE or SATA)
* VMware Workstation
* Ubuntu or derivative ISO or CDROM

== Installation ==
=== Configuration and Setup ===
==== Suggested Configuration ====
* Go to Advanced Configuration
===== Virtual Hardware =====
* Name: Xubuntu Install
* Guest OS: Other
* Memory Size: (Half of whatever you have in your current machine, NOT the one you are building for)
* # of CPUs: 1
===== CDROM Drives =====
* Either your CD, DVD, or ISO.
===== Hard Drive =====
* Use Physical Disk (make sure you are using the extra drive, in my case "\\.\PhysicalDrive1")
* Make sure you use the entire disk
=== Actual Installation ===
* Boot the VMX in VMware
* Boot by booting the DVD drive in VMware, in my case by selecting CD-ROM in the BIOS boot menu
* Continue through the install
* When you are done installing, after rebooting, shut down the VM and disconnect your virtual CD-ROM drive
* Once your drive is the way you like it, plug your hard drive back into the original system and boot!
