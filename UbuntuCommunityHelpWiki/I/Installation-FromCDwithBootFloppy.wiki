This explains how use a DOS boot floppy to install from a USB-connected CD/DVD drive, when the PC BIOS does not support booting from USB devices.

This has been tested with Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Server, but may be adaptable to other versions.

=== Requirements ===
* A floppy drive
* A USB-connected CD or DVD drive
* Ubuntu installation CD (6.06 LTS Server is know to work)
* MS-DOS or Windows 95/98 boot disk with MSCDEX.EXE
* Cypress DUSE USB drivers
* linld 0.97

=== Preparation ===
# Copy DUSE.EXE and DUSELDR.COM from the DUSE package, and LINLD.EXE (sometimes LINLD097.EXE) to the boot floppy.
# Examine the isolinux.cfg file in the isolinux directory of the Ubuntu CD to determine the necessary parameters for linld.
For example:
<pre>
LABEL install
  menu label ^Install to the hard disk
  kernel /install/vmlinuz
  append  preseed/file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed initrd=/install/initrd.gz ramdisk_size=16384 root=/dev/ram rw quiet --
</pre>
 1. Create a text file on your boot floppy, perhaps called options.txt, and paste in the all the parameters except the kernel and initrd.
For example:
<pre>
preseed/file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed ramdisk_size=16384 root=/dev/ram rw quiet --
</pre>
 1. Make a note of the name and location of the kernel and initrd files if different from above.

=== Installation ===
On the target computer:
 1. Connect and power up the USB CD/DVD drive and insert the Ubuntu installation CD.
 2. Boot using the boot floppy.
 3. Load the DUSE driver
<pre>
A:\> duseldr a:\duse.exe
</pre>
The USB drive should be detected at this stage, otherwise refer to the DUSE documentation for further options.
 4. Load the CDROM extensions
<pre>
A:\> MSCDEX /D:USBCDROM  /S  /M:15 /V 
</pre>
Check that the CD is now readable using dir d:
 5. Bootstrap the Ubuntu installer from the installation CD using linld
<pre>
A:\> linld097 image=d:\install\vmlinuz initrd=d:\install\initrd.gz cl=@options.txt
</pre>

Ubuntu should boot from the CD and the installer should start automatically.

=== Alternatives ===
* It should be possible to use FreeDOS instead of MS-DOS
* It should be possible to use some versions of loadlin.exe instead of linld.exe
