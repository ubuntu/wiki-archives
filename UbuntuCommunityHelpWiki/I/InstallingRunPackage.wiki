== Installing .run Packages ==

=== Warning ===
Careful consideration must be put into place whenever installing anything outside of the official repositories. Run files install software into the system via a script rather than a package manager. Verify that the run file you obtained came from a source that you trust before executing it.

=== Installation ===
Follow the procedures below to install software packaged in a .run file:

==== GUI ====
 1. Find the .run file in the '''File Browser'''.
 2. Right-click the file and select '''Properties'''.
 3. Under the '''Permissions''' tab, make sure that '''Allow executing file as program''' is ticked and press '''Close'''.
 4. Double-click the .run file to open it. A dialog box should appear.
 5. Press '''Run in Terminal''' to run the installer.
 6. A '''Terminal''' window will open. Follow any instructions on-screen to install the program.

==== Command-Line ====
 1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
 2. Execute '''chmod +x <file-to-give-execute-permission>.run'''
 3. Now that the execute permission has been set, simply run '''./<file>.run'''
