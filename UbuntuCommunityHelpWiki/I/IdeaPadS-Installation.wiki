__TOC__


This page contains initial installation suggestions.

== Prepare Media ==
To install Ubuntu on an IdeaPadS, you'll need to use either an external optical drive (connected via USB), or create USB storage install media.

* Refer to <nowiki>[[Installation-FromUSBStick]]</nowiki> for directions on creating USB installation media.
* You may also plug in an external optical drive and use an Ubuntu LiveCD/LiveDVD.

== Installation ==
Turn on the machine, and press <F2> to enter the Bios Setup.

Select the correct boot device/order and press <Enter>.

In the <F2> menu:
* USB-HDD refers to a USB storage device.
** Sometimes these will be referred to as USB-FDD, depending on the stick and the specific model of Aspire One. This will not affect the installation, though it is a bug that Acer should fix.
* USB-CDROM refers to an attached external optical drive.
