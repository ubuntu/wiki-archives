== What is iFolder? ==

iFolder is a file sharing solution for backing up and duplicating files across several machines. It can work in a small work group or a larger environment. It's complicated to install, but simple to use.

== Installation and Configuration ==

To configure an iFolder environment, you need both a server and a client. The server runs the iFolder Enterprise Server software which hosts all the files and controls the clients. The client connects to the server to access, backup and download iFolders.
