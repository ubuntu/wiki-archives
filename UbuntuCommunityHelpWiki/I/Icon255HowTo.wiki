'''This USB wireless modem is <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/418499|broken]]</nowiki> in Karmic 9.10.'''

----

This guide explains how to get an Orange Icon 255 wireless internet modem working. This guide has been translated/copied from <nowiki>[[http://www.equinoxefr.org/post/2008/04/21/la-clef-orange-icon-225-sur-ubuntu-804/|this blog post]]</nowiki>, and my French isn't particularly good. So feel free to update it if any of the crucial points are wrong.

This guide will work on any such modem, regardless of the branding--'''as long as the hardware is the same'''.

=== Getting the script ===

To get this modem to work, we will need two things: A driver and a connection script. Those can be downloaded from the original author's site, with the following command:

<pre>
wget http://www.equinoxefr.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/icon225.tgz
</pre>

Unpack the archive with the following command:

<pre>
tar xvf icon255.tgz
</pre>

This will produce a folder named ''hso/''. To enter it, use ''cd hso/''. It contains various files: The source code of the ''hso'' driver; A script to compile and install it; A connection script 

First, run ''install.sh'' with ''sudo ./install.sh'' - this will compile the driver and it's dependencies.

Note that Ubuntu allready commes with it's own version of the ''hso'' driver, but it is very unlikely to work with the given connection script.

Second, edit ''conninfo.ini'' with your information. You can use gedit, nano, vim... whatever for this.

<pre>
APN=orange
PIN=0000
</pre>

APN is the access point name of your provider. Refer to your manual to find it, and if you cannot find it in there you may also consider looking at the value choosen by the installer on a machine running Windows.
Change PIN to your pin number. Save the file.

Finally, to connect, use:

<pre>
sudo ./connect.sh up
</pre>

If this does not work, here is an alternative method that worked for me:

<pre>
sudo modprobe hso
sudo modprobe -r usb_storage
sudo ./connect.sh up
</pre>

Note that the order of the commands is very important here!

To disconnect again, use the following:

<pre>
sudo ./connect.sh down
</pre>

Happy surfing!

Tested on Intrepid Ibex 2.6.27-9-generic i686. Works great!
