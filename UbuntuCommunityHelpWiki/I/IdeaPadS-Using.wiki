This page lists tweaks and usability suggestions for the Lenovo IdeaPadS-series (S10 and S12).

== Touchpad ==
(NOT TESTED ON S10 or S12)
The IdeaPadS10 touchpad is quite easy to bump whilst typing. The best fix is to disable all scroll and tap commands for 1 second after each keystroke. (copied from AA1 page- not tested on S10!)

Go to Preferences and select "Sessions". Click the add button and add an entry:

<pre>
Name: Syndaemon
Command: syndaemon -d -t -i 1
Comment: Disable trackpad while typing
</pre>

The '1' can be changed to any decimal number, and defines the amount of time to lock the trackpad after each keystroke. See the Syndaemon man page for full details.

== Speed Up Boot Process ==
( NOT TESTED ON S10 / S12 )
To decrease boot time, activate concurrency bootup:
<code> gksudo gedit /etc/init.d/rc </code>
and replace the line:

 CONCURRENCY=none

with

 CONCURRENCY=shell

== Increase Battery Life ==
(NOT TESTED ON S10/S12)
Add the following to the /etc/rc.local file:

<pre>

echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/sched_smt_power_savings
echo 10 > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save
echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode

[ -w /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-7/power/level ] && echo auto > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-7/power/level

</pre>

On some Aspire Ones, usually AOA110, the #Decrease power usage of USB while idle part of the script might cause the screen to shutdown abruptly on battery power and freeze the system. If your AA1 produces the problem described here: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/83062
then perhaps, if you have applied the "Increase Battery" script here, you should comment the USB-idle power usage part.
