/!\ This is a work in progress, it is not mature yet and it may break your system!

=== Caveat ===
As you may already have guessed following this instruction may break your system and you are on your own to fix it again.
apt-get install linux-image-686
=== Scenario ===
This instruction describes how to install Ubuntu on a dedicated server over ssh. I assume that your provider provides you with a rescue system from which you can boot and prepare your system. An Online replacement is possible, but it is some more work and a lot more risky if things go bad (the basic idea is to temporarily disable your swap and install a transitional system on it).

=== Preparing the Hard Disk ===
==== Partitioning ====
Use <code>fdisk</code> to partition your hard disk.
<pre>
</pre>

Remember to set the root partition bootable!

For the rest of this instruction we assume the following partition layout.
<pre>
/dev/hda1 (83  Linux)        - for /, 
/dev/hda2 (82  Linux swap)   - as swap
</pre>

==== Creating File Systems ====
Below is how we get our / populated with ext3.
<pre>
</pre>

And the same for our swap partition.
<pre>
</pre>

=== The Base System ===

==== Mounting Root ====
<pre>
</pre>

==== Getting Debootstrap ====
Debootstrap is a collection of scripts that we will use in the next step to set up a base system. We need an appropriate version of <code>debootstrap</code> from http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/d/debootstrap/ to make this work.

Make sure that <code>binutils</code> is installed on your system.

On an apt based system we can use <code>dpkg</code> to install it.
<pre>
</pre>

If your current system is rpm based, use alien to install it or find a rpm on the web (http://azhrarn.underhanded.org/debootstrap-0.2.23-1.i386.rpm).

If your system is neither, this might work.
<pre>
</pre>

==== Installing the Base System ====
<pre>
</pre>

(arch may be different for you, e.g. amd64, hppa, ia64, powerpc, or sparc)

=== Basic Configuration ===
==== Set the Hostname ====
Change HOSTNAME to whatever suits your environment.
<pre>
</pre>

==== fstab ====
<pre>
</pre>

Put the following in fstab:
<pre>
proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
/dev/hda1       /               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
/dev/hda2       none            swap    sw              0       0
</pre>

==== Networking ====
Make sure to use your network details instead.
<pre>

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
        address 10.0.0.10
        network 10.0.0.0
        broadcast 10.0.0.255
        gateway 10.0.0.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
</pre>

Make sure to use your hostname and domain.
<pre>
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.0.1   hostname.domain.tld hostname
</pre>

You need a valid resolv.conf with at least one valid nameserver, e.g.:

<pre>
nameserver 10.0.0.1
</pre>

=== Enter the new environment ===
Before we chroot into the new environment we need to mount /proc and /dev
<pre>
mount -t proc none /mnt/ubuntu/proc
mount -o bind /dev /mnt/ubuntu/dev
LANG= chroot /mnt/ubuntu /bin/bash
</pre>

==== Change the root password ====
It is just bad if you forget this, so just ....
<pre>
</pre>

==== Create a user and switch shadow password on ====
<pre>
</pre>

=== Installing Packages ===

<pre>
</pre>

==== Installing OpenSSH Server ====
<pre>
</pre>

==== Install a Kernel ====
Choose the right kernel for your architecture. I go with:
<pre>
</pre>

==== RAID ====

<pre>
apt-get install mdadm
</pre>

==== Reboot ====

<pre>
</pre>

<pre>
</pre>

=== Finishing ===
After the reboot ssh in again.

==== Generate locales ====
<pre>
</pre>

==== Install some more packages ====
<pre>
apt-get install ubuntu-standard
</pre>
