__TOC__

DICT is a file format and protocol for dictionaries and dictionary queries.

To use DICT, you will need
- a DICT client installed on your computer
- a DICT server, either running on your computer or available on the Internet
- one or more DICT dictionaries, if you're running a local server on your computer

=== Client ===

Ubuntu (GNOME) comes with a default DICT client, accessible from the Applications menu (Accessories > Dictionary).

Kubuntu's default client is KDict, accessible from the K menu (Internet > Online Dictionary). A "Dictionary" applet for the panel is also available, and can be added to a panel by right-clicking on the panel and selecting "Add applet to panel".

=== Server ===

The clients come configured to connect to Internet DICT servers.
If you, however, would like to install a server locally, you can install the package <code>dictd</code> or <code>serpento</code> using !!!any method.

You will then have to install one or more dictionaries. Dictionaries for English are provided in the <code>dict-gcide</code> and <code>dict-wn</code> packages, while the package <code>dict-moby-thesaurus</code> offers a thesaurus.

To use your newly installed local DICT server, you will have to configure your client accordingly.
