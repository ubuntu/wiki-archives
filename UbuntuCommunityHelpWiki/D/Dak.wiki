__TOC__

Dak stands for "Debian Archive Kit." It is a tool designed to manage Debian package repositories. It manages Debian's package repositories and as a consequence, it is designed to handle huge and active repos. Its complexity makes it a bad choice for handling a personal repository. It is also poorly documented because it was not intended to be used by anyone outside of Debian.
