== Installation ==

To install this software, <nowiki>[[InstallingSoftware#installing-a-package|install the package]]</nowiki>: '''''<nowiki>[[apt:dia|dia]]</nowiki>'''''.

== Hints and Tips ==

* When exporting to SVG, it is best not to use Cairo Scalable Vector Graphic (*.svg). This is due to how this option is deprecated, due to it being a GDK based display renderer, with limited support for path with holes or transparency. For more on this, please see <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=735493|here]]</nowiki>.
