Distributed Computing, also known as "Grid Computing" is where you install a program onto your computer that works in the backround, and uses your spare CPU resources to do various forms of scientific research, depending on what client you are using. Some examples of these programs are <nowiki>[[http://folding.stanford.edu/|Folding@home]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org|World Community Grid]]</nowiki>

Below are some tutorials to help you install and configure these types of programs.
