=== Goals ===
The goals of this page are...
** to be a comprehensive list of DocBook-aware editor programs
** to distinguish which programs are included in Ubuntu
** to present this information in a consistent format
** ~+please try to stick to the format+~ thank you :)
The questions that I am trying to help you to answer for yourself are...
** How easy or hard is it going to be for me to get this program?
** How easy or hard is it going to be for me to install this program?
** How much help am I going to need and will I be able to get it?
** Will the look and feel of the app be comfortable to me?

=== Test Suite ===
You can find many sample documents in the DocBook SourceForge CVS Repository which may be useful to exercise program features:
** https://docbook.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docbook/trunk/testdocs/tests/
=== Supported ===
These programs are available from the Ubuntu package repositories.  Packages in the "main" repository should be well supported by the Ubuntu community.  Packages in the "universe" repository are contributed by smaller groups or individuals and may not be as well-supported.

=== Unsupported ===
These programs are not available in the Ubuntu package repositories.  Some packages may not be included due to licensing restrictions.  Perhaps you would like to volunteer to package one of these programs for Ubuntu?  There is certainly nothing wrong with using these programs, but you may need to turn to their own user community if you need assistance.

=== Commercial Applications ===
These programs require you to pay money for a license, but usually included in that price is professional support from the program vendor.  Several of these programs also have a Lite version with several features disabled.  Lite versions are usually free for personal use but restricted.

=== Dead Projects ===
These are programs which appear to be abandoned by the author.  I have included them here to answer the question, "But what about program <X>?"  If you are a developer and you really like the program, perhaps you could contact the author to ask about resuming development or creating a fork.
==== moleskine ====
** environment: Gnome
** component: Scintilla
** homepage: http://micampe.it/things/moleskine
** install: http://micampe.it/things/moleskine
** community:
** comments:

==== conglomerate (last news in 2005) ====
** repository: universe
** environment: GNOME
** homepage: http://www.conglomerate.org/index.html
** install: <code>conglomerate</code>
** community: http://www.conglomerate.org/getting_involved.html
** comments: boxes don't display right on dapper with default settings
*** some very interesting concepts for organizing the display vs. other editors

=== Editor Components ===
Peeking at the source code, I found there is similarity between many of the programs because they are based on the same widget set or editor component.  For example SciTE and Geany are both based on the Scintilla code editor component, while bluefish and gedit are based on the GtkSourceView component.  The component that is used controls how the editor displays and manages code folding and syntax highlighting for example.  I think it would be a useful exercise to identify the editor component used by each application.
