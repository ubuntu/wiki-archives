=== What is DOSBox? ===
DOSBox is a free, open-source cross-platform MS-DOS emulator that uses the SDL library.  It emulates CPU:286/386 realmode/protected mode, Directory FileSystem/XMS/EMS, Tandy/Hercules/CGA/EGA/VGA/VESA graphics, and SoundBlaster/Gravis Ultra Sound cards.  Thus, it is possible to run many programs originally written for MS-DOS in Linux with DOSBox.  

The emulator has been largely developed for use with old games, but it may be possible to use DOSBox to run other MS-DOS applications.  The DOSBox project maintains a <nowiki>[[http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/comp_list.php?letter=a|list of compatible games]]</nowiki>.  

To run more recent applications developed for Windows, use <nowiki>[[Wine]]</nowiki>.

=== Installation ===
You will need to enable the Universe repositories (see AddingRepositoriesHowto), update, and install the <code>dosbox</code> package.

=== Running DOSBox ===
=== Starting DOSBox ===
DOSBox can be run from a terminal by simply typing <code> dosbox </code>.

This will open up what looks like another terminal window, with a <code> Z:\ </code> prompt.  This is DOSBox.  

=== Running MS-DOS Programs inside DOSBox ===
==== Mounting Drives and Directories: The " mount "  command ====
Seeing a <code> Z:\ </code> where one might have expected to see <code> C:\ </code> or even <code> A:\ </code>  will seem strange to those familiar with MS-DOS and command.com.  

DOSBox does not have a <code> C:\ </code> drive enabled by default.  To give it one, we must ''mount'' one onto the virtual machine.  

In practice, this means we must create a directory which can serve as a virtual <code> C:\ </code> drive for DOSBox.  

(''  '''N.B.'''  In the following examples, and throughout this document, we are assuming a user named "wikiuser".  Replace that user-name with yours. '')

In a regular terminal, (NOT DOSBox), you can execute

<code> $ mkdir -p ~/dos/c </code>

which will create the <code> /dos/c </code> directory in your home directory.  To have DOSBox use this as its <code> C:\ </code> drive, execute the following command in DOSBox:

<pre>
mount c /home/wikiuser/dos/c 
</pre>

This makes the contents of <code> ~/dos/c/ </code> the contents of the virtual <code> C:\ </code> drive in DOSBox.  You can now run any DOS programs in that directory in DOSBox. If those DOS programs are self-contained executables, it's enough simply to copy them onto a suitable sub-directory in <code> ~/dos/c </code> and run them within DOSBox.  For other programs, you may need to run their installers.  Consult the <nowiki>[[http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/comp_list.php?letter=a|compatibility list]]</nowiki> for details for each one.

It is also possible to mount removeable disks in this way;  simply specify the path to the removeable disk instead.  

For a more technical discussion of the mount command in DOSBox, consult the <nowiki>[[http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?page=Internal+Programs%2FMount|manual page]]</nowiki> for that command. 

'' Note that many of the examples on the official DOSBox will seem to be specific to MS-DOS or Windows.  Where you see a Windows-type path like <code> C:\OLDGAMES </code> , simply read a Linux-style path.  The result of the commands should be the same. ''

==== Mounting Disk Images: the " imgmount "  command ====
It is also possible(and in many cases desireable) to mount disk images in DOSBox, using the <code> imgmount </code> command.  

Most commonly, this is used to mount CD-ROM images.  To mount a CD-ROM image in DOSBox, execute the following command in DOSBox:

<code> imgmount d /path/to/cd/image.iso -t iso </code>

This will mount an .iso to the DOSBox virtual machine as a CD-ROM.  

A more technical discussion of the imgmount command can be found at <nowiki>[[http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?page=Internal+Programs%2FImgMount|its manual page]]</nowiki>
