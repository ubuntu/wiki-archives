__TOC__

The most commonly spoken language among the developers and BugSquad is English (or so it seems). Its therefore useful to get english error messages on bug reports.

=== Translating the bug report ===

Try to 
* use http://translate.google.com/ to translate the bug report
* ask in `#ubuntu-bugs` if somebody speaks the language in question
* ask the reporter politely if they can reply in English

=== Commandline output ===
If a user has posted a non-english error, politely ask them to run the command preceded by
<pre>
LANGUAGE=C
</pre>

for example
<pre>
LANGUAGE=C sudo apt-get upgrade
</pre>
