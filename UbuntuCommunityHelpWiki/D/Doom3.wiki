=== Install Scripts ===
Linux Guy Marshall has prepared some scripts and the guide to use them on his site <nowiki>[[http://sites.google.com/site/lgmscripts/scripts/games/doom-3|here]]</nowiki>

== Acquiring Doom3 for Linux ==
You can download the latest version from <nowiki>[[http://ftp.gameaholic.com/pub/mirrors/ftp.idsoftware.com/doom3/source/|this mirror odid Software's ftp server, at gameaholic.com]]</nowiki>

As of 2012-07-25, the latest version is doom3-linux-1.3.1.1304.x86.run. It hasn't been updated since 2007-02-02.

This package contains only the binary sources for Linux!

== Installation of the Linux binary ==
If your computer is 64-bit, Doom 3 requires the ia32-libs package which can be installed by running <code>sudo apt-get install ia32-libs</code>

The installation writes to /usr/local/games/doom3 by default.  You should install using sudo to ensure write permissions to /usr/local/games/doom3, and make sure that the installation file is executable.
<pre>
chmod +x doom3-linux-x.x.xxxx.x86.run
sudo ./doom3-linux-x.x.xxxx.x86.run

sudo ./doom3-linux-1.3.1.1304.x86.run
</pre>
== Add the missing files ==
The following files need to be copied from the win32 install CDs to your <code>base/</code> directory.
by default, <code>/usr/local/games/doom3/base</code>
<pre>
base/pak000.pk4
base/pak001.pk4
base/pak002.pk4
base/pak003.pk4
base/pak004.pk4

sudo cp /media/cdrom0/Setup/Data/base/pak00*.pk4 /usr/local/games/doom3/base
</pre>

== Resurrection of Evil Expansion Pack ==
If you are also installing the Resurrection of Evil Expansion Pack, you need to copy the following file to your <code>d3xp/</code> directory by default, <code>/usr/local/games/doom3/d3xp</code>
<pre>
d3xp/pak000.pk4
</pre>

== Start Doom3 ==
Start Doom3 with the following command:
<pre>
doom3
</pre>

== Start the dedicated server ==
Start the dedicated server with the command:
<pre>
doom3-dedicated
</pre>

== Start Expansion Pack ==
If installed, you can start the Expansion Pack directly from the command line with the command:
<pre>
doom3 +set fs_game d3xp
</pre>
Or you can select it in the mods menu of the base game.

== Localization ==
Localization is untested in the Linux builds at this point. More localization features are possible in future release. Until then you should '''not copy over''' the <code>zpak000.pk4</code> file at all.

== Sound Problems ==
If sound is distorted, (to the extent speech is not understandable) then try running doom 3 with the command:
<pre>
doom3  +set s_driver oss +set s_numberOfSpeakers 2
</pre>

== Mouse Problems or Small or OffCenter Window Problems ==
My doom3 install worked but when I ran doom3, it came up in a small window and the mouse either didn't work or wouldn't move properly.  Consequently, I could enter the CD key but could not click the '''OK''' button to continue.

The cause was that I was running Xinerama to drive my dual monitors off of an nvidia dual-out videocard.  Once I switched to NVidia TwinView, it worked perfectly!  See the article <nowiki>[[http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/blog/2007/02/nvidia_twinview_and_xorgconf.html|Nvidia, TwinView, and xorg.conf]]</nowiki> for details on how to switch to TwinView if you are having this problem.

If you are using Xinerama but cannot use TwinView (e.g., if you do not have an NVidia video card) then try shutting off Xinerama and see if that helps (by editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf and restarting X by logging out and back in, or typing <code>sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart</code>).

== Jerky frame rates in-game ==
If you experience hitching or jerky frame rates, try typing ONE or BOTH of the following in the ingame console.
Do this one first of all before you try any other commands in the console.
Could lock the weapon zoom until you load a new level.
<pre>
vid_restart
</pre>

this one could also solve it.
<pre>
com_PreciseTic 0
</pre>

Causes really fast framerate
<pre>
com_fixedtic 1
</pre>

== Blank screen on amd64 with NVIDIA proprietary drivers ==

''This problem has been reported on Ubuntu Gutsy 7.10 amd64 with the NVIDIA proprietary drivers.''

If the screen goes blank after you start Doom3, try starting it with this command:

<pre>
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libGL.so.1 doom3
</pre>

If it works, you can replace the /usr/local/bin/doom3 symlink with this script and the menu icon should start it properly:

<pre>
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libGL.so.1 /usr/local/games/doom3/doom3
</pre>
