== Introduction ==
A great deal of effort has been made to allow automatic configuration of the X window system without asking questions of the user.  However, there is an astounding variety of hardware in use around the world, and so it is impossible to test every combination of devices...at least, without your help!

== Reporting X Bugs ==
An easy way to report bugs in 8.10 and newer is:

<pre>
ubuntu-bug xorg
</pre>

This command will make sure all the appropriate files and stuff are attached to your bug report.

== Debugging X ==
Lots of info on reporting X bugs, common issues, troubleshooting, etc.:
