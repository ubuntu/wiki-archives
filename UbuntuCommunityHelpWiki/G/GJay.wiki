__TOC__

<nowiki>[[http://gjay.sourceforge.net/|GJay]]</nowiki> generates playlists across a collection of music (ogg, mp3, wav) such that each song sounds good following the previous song. It is ideal for home users who want a non-random way to wander large collections or for DJs planning a set list. You can generate playlists from within the application, or run GJay as a standalone command-line utility.

Playlist matches are based on:

*** Song characteristics that don't change
**** Frequency fingerprint
**** Beats per minute
**** Location in file system 
*** Song attributes that you set
**** Rating
**** Color (whatever that means to you) 

<pre>
sudo apt-get install gjay vorbis-tools
</pre>
This will install also ogg suport
