Several years in the making and thousands of man hours of research, this well received book is intended for Avaneya’s ever–growing community of contributors who would like to learn more about the thinking behind this project.

Although intended for community contributors, it may not be appropriate for players since it contains plot spoilers.

On the other hand, our eventual players of Avaneya are just as likely to enrich the game through constructive feedback – feedback best buttressed with a well–informed understanding of the project's goals outlined in this comprehensive volume.

Please note that this is a living document and is updated frequently. If you'd like to send it to someone, better to send a link to the latest copy <nowiki>[[https://www.avaneya.com/#!/content/downloads/handbook.html|here]]</nowiki>.
