== Introduction ==
There are thousands of games available which are free software and will run natively on Ubuntu.  In addition, there are emulators that will run many games for Windows or even classic game consoles. Whether you enjoy card games or shoot 'em ups, there's something for everyone.

Have fun!

== Ubuntu Games ==
All the games in the following sections are native to Ubuntu. This means that there is either an Ubuntu package in the repositories, or available from a third-party. Differences between these sections come down to a single issue: licensing. The <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/our-philosophy|Ubuntu Philosophy]]</nowiki> is that all software distributed with Ubuntu is free and open-source. Some of the following games may be free but not open-source. Others may require a fee to use them. Still others may require payment for certain aspects of a game, but also offer a free element.
