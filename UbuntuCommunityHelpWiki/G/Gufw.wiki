== Introduction ==

<nowiki>[[File:Gufw/gufw.png]]</nowiki> Gufw is a firewall powered by <nowiki>[[UFW]]</nowiki> (Uncomplicated Firewall).  For an overview of firewalls, please see <nowiki>[[Firewall]]</nowiki>.

== Installation ==
In order to install Gufw, you must have the Universe <nowiki>[[Repositories-Ubuntu|repository]]</nowiki> enabled.  To install, use <nowiki>[[Synaptic]]</nowiki>, or run from <nowiki>[[Terminal]]</nowiki>:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install gufw
</pre>

== Usage ==

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/menu.png]]</nowiki> To access GUFW, go to '''System->Administration->Firewall configuration'''.

By default, the firewall is disabled.

 <nowiki>[[File:disabled.png]]</nowiki>

=== Enabling ===
To enable the firewall, simply check the '''Enabled''' button and the default will be set to '''Deny''' for incoming traffic and '''Allow''' for outgoing traffic.

 <nowiki>[[File:enabled.png]]</nowiki>

=== Adding Rules ===

To configure the firewall, we add rules.  Simply click the '''Add''' button and a new window will pop up. For details about this implementation, see the <nowiki>[[UFW]]</nowiki> page.  Rules can be configured for TCP and UDP ports, and UFW has some preconfigured programs/services to make setting up rules for them easy.

The available options for rules are ''Allow'', ''Deny'', ''Reject'', and ''Limit'':
* Allow: The system will allow entry traffic for a port.
* Deny: The system will deny entry traffic to a port.
* Reject: The system will deny entry traffic to a port and will inform the requesting for connection system that it has been rejected.
* Limit: The system will deny connections if an IP address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last 30 seconds.

==== Preconfigured ====
The '''Preconfigured''' tab gives us some options for controlling firewall options for common programs and services.

  <nowiki>[[File:preconfigured.png]]</nowiki>

You have several categories and subcategories. You can filter by name/description/ports too.

==== Simple ====
Not all program configurations are available in Gufw, but we can still add rules for them using the '''Simple''' tab.

  <nowiki>[[File:simple.png]]</nowiki>

Again, we'll use the SSH example - let's just pretend for a moment that there isn't a preconfigured option for it.  To enable it in the '''Simple''' tab, select "Allow", "TCP", "22" and click '''Add'''.

==== Advanced ====
Sometimes we want to configure access based on a specific IP, so we use the '''Advanced''' tab.

  <nowiki>[[File:advanced.png]]</nowiki>

== Preferences ==
There are a few preferences available to set in Gufw, and can be controlled from '''Edit->Preferences'''

  <nowiki>[[File:preferences.png]]</nowiki>

Here you can control logging for ufw and for Gufw, create profiles and set general interface preferences. The default is to enable logging for ufw, and disable logging for Gufw.

== Use Gufw without Graphical Environment or Remote Computer ==
=== Requirements ===
You can use Gufw in a Linux without Graphical Environment (for example an Ubuntu Server) or from a remote computer. You will need '''Gufw 13.10.2 or higher'''. Just export your X Display. All the operations in Gufw will be apply in the remote computer.

=== How use it ===
----
Important: If you enable the firewall under ssh without the ssh rule, you'll close the ssh connection, then before to enable Gufw under a ssh connection, append the ssh rule using ufw with this command: 
<pre>
sudo ufw enable ssh
</pre>
----
* From a local computer with Linux:
** Remote computer without graphic environment (IP = 192.168.1.102, Gufw installed and ssh server).
** Local Linux. In the local computer, open a Terminal and run this command:
<pre>
  ssh user_remote@192.168.1.102 -X
  sudo /usr/bin/gufw-pkexec -ssh
  </pre>

  <nowiki>[[File:linux1.png]]</nowiki>

* From a local computer with Windows:
** Windows IP = 192.168.1.101; Linux IP = 192.168.1.100
** Install <nowiki>[[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/|Putty]]</nowiki> & <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/|Xming]]</nowiki>.
** In Windows: Run XLaunch from the Start Menu and check "No Access Control" in the last step.
** Connect to your Linux with Putty and run:
  <pre>
  export DISPLAY=192.168.1.101:0.0
  sudo /usr/bin/gufw-pkexec -ssh
  </pre>

== Enable IP forwarding ==
=== Requirements ===
Gufw 14.10 or higher.

=== How use set it ===
To routing policy and rules, you must setup IP forwarding in the system:
* Close Gufw
* Uncomment these 3 lines in the file /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf:
<pre>
### net/ipv4/ip_forward=1
### net/ipv6/conf/default/forwarding=1
### net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding=1
</pre>
* Reload the firewall:
<pre>
    sudo ufw reload
</pre>
Open Gufw, you'll see a new "Routed" option (with an arrow around the shield) and you can forward any rule from the Update window or Advanced Tab in Add window.
