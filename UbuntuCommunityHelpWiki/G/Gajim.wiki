== Gajim ==

Gajim is a free software, instant messaging client for the Jabber (XMPP) protocol which uses the GTK+ toolkit. It runs on GNU/Linux, BSD and Windows. The name Gajim is a recursive acronym for '''G'''ajim (is) '''a''' '''j'''abber '''i'''nstant '''m'''essenger''.

The goal of Gajim is to provide a full featured and easy to use Jabber client. Gajim works nicely with GNOME, but does not require it to run. It is released under the GNU General Public License.

== Gajim features ==

* Tabbed chat windows

* TLS and OpenPGP support (the latter not available under Windows), including SSL legacy support

Gajim is available in the following languages : Basque, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, English, Esperanto, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian (Bokmål), Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Slovak and Swedish.

== Network features ==
Gajim is a Jabber client and Jabber allows transports to other services, which many servers support. So Gajim can also connect to the Yahoo! Messenger, AIM, ICQ and .NET Messenger Service networks, which is a great advantage for an open source application. Other services available using gateway servers, include RSS and Atom news feeds, sending SMS messages to cellular networks and weather reports. Last but not least you can be connected more than once with an account with differents resources and priorities. For example, you can be connected at home with resource "At Home" and priority 5, and when you are at work you can be connected with resource "At Work" and priority 7 to get your messages at work.

== Installing Gajim ==
Gajim can be found at the Ubuntu Universe repository, so you can simply install package gajim from the Universe repository using your favorite method. If you need help about installing a package read the following InstallingSoftware.

== Setting up Gajim ==
After installation Gajim can be found to start at '''Applications''' -> '''Internet''' -> '''Gajim Instant Messenger'''.

On the first time you start up Gajim the Account Creation Wizard Dialog will come up, which will guide you to either create a new account to connect to the jabber network or use an existing one, if you have.

So if this is your first time in the jabber network select the option for registering for a new account, choose one of the numerous jabber servers available that offers you the services you need (check out <nowiki>[[http://www.jabber.org/network/oldnetwork.shtml|jabber.org]]</nowiki> for that) and simply give a username and password. You are now connected!

You can always add a new account at '''Edit''' -> '''Accounts''' -> '''New'''

=== Gajim and GoogleTalk ===
You can configure Gajim to connect to GoogleTalk, which uses the Jabber protocol. 

After starting Gajim, if this is your first time you start Gajim the Account Creation Dialog shown below will come up. If the dialog does not come up click on '''Edit''' then click on '''Accounts''' and click '''New''' in the window that opens up.

...then enter the following information:

Now click '''Forward''' and then '''Advanced'''.

Click '''Save''' and that's it! Now you are ready to connect to Google Talk using Gajim.

Note however that voice chat is not supported.

''If you are using a Google Apps account, you have to use the steps above and use your my_login@mydomain.com instead of my_login@gmail.com.''

=== MSN/ICQ/AIM/Y!M/etc. transport ===
First of all, please note that not all servers support a MSN/ICQ/AIM/Y!M/etc. transport. Secondly all the info below are assuming that you already have a account on the MSN/ICQ/AIM/Y!M/etc. service, which you want to use.

To setup your MSN/ICQ/AIM/Y!M/etc. transport from Gajim, browse the services available on your Jabber server. To do this, open up the '''Actions''' menu, and select the relevant account from the '''Discover Services''' menu. If your Jabber server supports a MSN/ICQ/AIM/Y!M/etc. transport, you should see a section entitled '''Transports''' with an MSN/ICQ/AIM/etc. transport service listed.

Select the MSN/ICQ/AIM/Y!M/etc. transport service, and click the '''Register''' button. Then you enter your account username (i.e. example@hotmail.com or 123-345-567 etc.) and the password for your account.

After setting up your transport as such, logging in and out is a simple matter of right clicking the MSN/ICQ/AIM/Y!M/etc. transport (in the '''Transports''' group which shows up in your buddy list), and clicking '''Log on''' or '''Log off'''. You can remove the transport by removing it from your roster (right click, Remove from Roster). You can also hide the '''Transports''' group by unchecking the '''Show Transports''' option in the '''View''' menu.
