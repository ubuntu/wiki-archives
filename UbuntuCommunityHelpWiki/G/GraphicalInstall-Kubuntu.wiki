== Overview ==

There are a number of ways for you to run and install Kubuntu:

* Run Kubuntu directly from the live-cd. This is run from your computer's ram, so nothing is preserved after rebooting or powering down your system. This is a great way to check things out before beginning the install process.
* Install Kubuntu as the sole operating system (single-boot) or alongside your exisitng operating system(s), choosing which one during the boot process (dual-boot). This may be be done either from the live-cd during at startup, or directly from a running live-cd session.
* Install directly from within Windows using <nowiki>[[Wubi]]</nowiki>, found on the live-cd
* You can install it within your existing operating system using a simulated environment (virtualization). See <nowiki>[[VirtualMachines]]</nowiki> for installation options using this method.

This page will cover installing Kubuntu using the live disc either from boot or from a live session.

=== Getting Kubuntu ===
First, you will need to download a cd ISO image of the latest version of Kubuntu. This can be found <nowiki>[[http://www.kubuntu.org/getkubuntu | here]]</nowiki>, where you can also find information about ordering a cd if you are unable to download or burn the file to disk. From that page, select "Download Now" option. Once at the next page, you will need to select which release you want. Then you will need to select what type of computer you have, either standard (32 bit) or 64 bit. If you are not sure, choose "Standard Computer" as that will work in either type. Next, select a location to download from that is closest to where you are, and click the download link.

You also can download your ISO image via BitTorrent from links at the bottom of the download page.

=== Burn ISO image ===
The Kubuntu installation file you downloaded is an image file, and as such it must be burned to a disc in the correct manner. Many CD/DVD burning programs can automatically detect and burn these files correctly, but BurningIsoHowto gives detailed instructions on burning ISO disk images, as well as some free and open-source tools with which to perform this task.

To burn the installation disk to a CD or DVD:
# Place a recordable CD or DVD into your CD/DVD drive.
# Load an application that is capable of burning .ISO image files to CDs or DVDs.
# Using your CD and DVD writing program, copy the disk image to your blank CD or DVD.

== Installing Kubuntu ==

=== Booting from the CD ===

Your computer must be set to boot from a cd drive. In most cases, this should happen automatically. If it does not, you may have to go into your BIOS and set your cd/dvd drive to be the first boot device. You can get to your bios usually by hitting the Delete key immediately after powering on  your system. The correct key(s) can vary, so please refer to your computer's documentation to find out the correct method. If are having difficulty booting from the burned disc, or have a system that cannot boot from a cd/dvd drive, please refer to <nowiki>[[BootFromCD]]</nowiki> for troubleshooting tips and other booting options.

=== Install from a Live Session ===

'''''NOTE''': Prior to installing Kubuntu, it is highly recommended that you back up your user files.

Insert the Kubuntu disc into your CD drive.

Start or restart your computer. The Language screen appears. 

<nowiki>[[File:language_select.jpg]]</nowiki>

Select your language here.

<nowiki>[[File:live_boot.jpg]]</nowiki>

Select the "Try Kubuntu" option to begin a live session.

<nowiki>[[File:10.04_live_desktop.jpg]]</nowiki>

Once you have booted to a full KDE desktop, you can test Kubuntu before installing it. After giving it a try, all you have to do to begin the process is to click the "Install Kubuntu" icon.

<nowiki>[[File:welcome.jpg]]</nowiki>

Here is the Welcome Screen, where you select the language for the install. Make your selection, and click the 'Forward" button.

<nowiki>[[File:timezone.jpg]]</nowiki>

Next, select your timezone. You can click on the map or make your selection from the drop-down lists. Click "Forward" to proceed.

<nowiki>[[File:keyboard.jpg]]</nowiki>

Here you can verify that your keyboard layout is correct and make any changes if necessary. Again, click "Forward" to proceed.

<nowiki>[[File:snapshot17.png]]</nowiki>

If you have an existing operating system on your drive, Kubuntu's installer will detect it and offer you the option to install it alongside your current OS.

<nowiki>[[File:single_boot.jpg]]</nowiki>

Or, if you wish to install Kubuntu to your entire drive, you would choose "Erase and use Entire Disk" here.

'''''WARNING''': Installing Kubuntu on your entire hard disk will erase '''all''' data that is currently on the drive.''

Once this task is complete, click the "Forward" button to proceed.

<nowiki>[[File:user_setup.jpg]]</nowiki>

Next, you will need to create a User account. This account will have full Administrative privileges. Fill in the required information and select your login options, then click "Forward". Remember that there can not be capital letters in the user name.

<nowiki>[[File:summary.jpg]]</nowiki>

Here is a summary of what the installer is going to do. Check this out for accuracy, use the "Back" buttons to make any changes if needed, then click on "Install" to begin the process.

<nowiki>[[File:finish.jpg]]</nowiki>

Once the installation has finished, you will be prompted to reboot, and you can restart you computer and begin to enjoy Kubuntu!

=== Installation Directly from the CD ===
You may also begin the installation directly from the cd, without booting to the full KDE desktop. 

Insert the Kubuntu disc into your CD drive.

Start or restart your computer. The Language screen appears. 

<nowiki>[[File:language_select.jpg]]</nowiki>

Select your language here.

<nowiki>[[File:select_install.jpg]]</nowiki>

Select "Install Kubuntu" here.
From this point, the steps are the same as for installing from a live session.
