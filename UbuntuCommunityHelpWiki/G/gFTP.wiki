== gFTP ==

gFTP is an easy to use FTP client. It includes both a gui version and a command line interfrace. gFTP is released under GPL license terms and is translated in about 41 languages. The GUI uses a double paned layout, with the local filesystem on the left side and the remote filesystem on the right side. This gives user advantage of easy to view file transfer. One of the best things about gFTP is the message log that informs user about any errors or messages that occur during the transaction.
