== Comments ==

Quake 2 is in Multiverse, and is called <code>quake2</code>. (However, for me it fails with a message: <code>Error: Couldn't load pics/colormap.pcx</code> ) -- Warbo
    The <code>quake2</code> package in Multiverse isn't the full game, just the game engine. The engine is open sourced, but the game artwork and such has never been. -- Madpilot       * Yes, when the package used to work for me (in Breezy) it would only play one (presumably freeware) level, but I was actually wondering if the "Binaries" section could include the package as well, or doesn't the Multiverse package work like that? (I know a few Doom packages which ask for the path to the WAD files and they work fine, but I only have Quake games on N64 so I haven't been able to test such a thing on my PC) -- Warbo
    <code>quake2</code> will be found in the Dapper Multiverse when using http://packages.ubuntu.com/search. It has not been carried forward since Dapper. (For those also wanting a native Quake 1 for debian based OS, you can turn to http://archive.debian.net to locate it in http://archive.debian.org -- which also has <code>quake2</code> for ARM, PPC and others.) -- markstinson
