==== Unreal Tournament ====
<nowiki>[[File:Games/unreal_tournament.jpg|Unreal Tournament Screenshot|height=200]]</nowiki>

Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it's now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3.
At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point.

Unreal Tournament 2004 is the third game in the popular Unreal Tournament series.

This latest edition includes several new features. First and foremost is the return of Assault mode from the original Unreal Tournament. This mode pits two teams, attackers and defenders, against each other. The attackers must try to complete various objectives, and the defenders have to stop them. At the end of the round, whether time runs out or the attackers win, the roles are switched, and the defenders become the attackers. A mode new to 2004 is Onslaught. Another team-based mode, there are several Power Nodes spread throughout the map, with one base per team that houses a large Power Core. The players must go to each Power Node, link it to the enemy Core, and eventually attack the enemy Power Core itself. Rounding out the remainder of the game modes is the standard Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Double Domination, Bombing Run, Last Man Standing, Invasion, and Mutant, for a total of ten different game modes.
