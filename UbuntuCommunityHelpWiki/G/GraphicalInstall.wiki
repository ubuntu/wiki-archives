# Insert the Ubuntu disk into your DVD drive. (or connect your <nowiki>[[Installation-FromUSBStick |liveUSB]]</nowiki>)
# Make sure that your BIOS (boot order) is set to boot from a DVD/USB before a hard drive. If you are installing for the first time on a computer which came with Windows 8 installed, you may be sure that the boot order is NOT factory-set to boot from the DVD. You must change the factory setting. Please refer to <nowiki>[[BootFromCD]]</nowiki>
