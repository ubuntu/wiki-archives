== Uninstalling GRUB 2 ==
=== Reverting to GRUB Legacy ===
If a user chooses to return to GRUB legacy (0.97), these steps will remove GRUB 2 and install GRUB.

The command line produces a cleaner uninstall and reinstallation. While adding and removing the packages can be accomplished with Synaptic, certain steps must be accomplished in a terminal.
# Open a terminal: Applications, Accessories, Terminal.
# Optional: Make backup copies of the main GRUB 2 directories and files.
** `sudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.old`
** `sudo cp -R /etc/grub.d /etc/grub.d.old`
** `sudo cp -R /boot/grub /boot/grub.old`
1. Remove GRUB 2
** `sudo apt-get purge grub-pc`
** <nowiki>[[File:important.png]]</nowiki> The system will be unbootable until another bootloader is installed.
** Once the packages are removed, many files will still remain in '/boot/grub'

1. Install GRUB 0.97
** `sudo apt-get install grub`
1. With ''grub'' installed, the user must still create the ''menu.lst'' and ''stage1/stage2'' files by running the following two commands.
  A. `sudo grub-install /dev/sdX`
** Choose the correct device (sda, sdb, etc), normally the one on which Ubuntu is installed.
** Creates the ''stage1'' and ''stage2'' files in ''/boot/grub'' and writes to the MBR.
  A. `sudo update-grub`
** Generates ''menu.lst''
** Tab to "Yes" when prompted.
1. Reboot
<nowiki>[[File:important.png]]</nowiki>If the user receives an "Unrecognized device string Error 11" message on rebooting see the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Resolving%20an%20%22Unrecognized%20Device%20String%22%20(Error%2011)|Resolving an "Unrecognized Device String" (Error 11)]]</nowiki> section for instructions on how to edit the menu and make the system bootable.
