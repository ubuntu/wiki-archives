__TOC__

OpenDB also, known as <nowiki>[[http://www.openbd.org/|Open BlueDragon]]</nowiki>.

<nowiki>[[http://www.openbd.org/|Open BlueDragon]]</nowiki>  is the worlds first truly open source GPL Java and Google App Engine CFML runtime.

CFML is a powerful tag/script based language that takes away all the heavy lifting of producing web based services and sites. CFML, <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language|ColdFusion Markup Language]]</nowiki> was originally created by Jeremy Allaire back in 1995.

CFML is a powerful script based language that takes away all the heavy lifting of producing web based services and sites.

But CFML offers more than merely a set of tags and functions.

Often misunderstood, CFML can do far more to accelerate your enterprise requirements than almost any other language, running on top of the popular Java runtime, there is no place OpenBD can't be deployed to.
