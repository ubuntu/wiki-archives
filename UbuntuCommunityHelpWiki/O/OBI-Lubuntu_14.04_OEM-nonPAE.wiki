== Lubuntu 14.04 LTS OEM non-pae, the OBI tarball ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <#CCFF99> new OEM version '5'
|}

=== Background information ===

All new LTS releases have some bugs that may or may not be considered
annoying. Lubuntu 14.04 LTS is no exception. We expect that these bugs
will be squashed before the end of life of Lubuntu 13.10 (in July 2014).
Near the end of life, if you make a fresh install or upgrade Lubuntu
from 13.10 to 14.04 LTS, and update & dist-upgrade the system, we expect
that it will run well.

Furthermore the first point release (of iso files) will be released in
August 2014. We expect that '''Lubuntu 14.04.1 LTS''' will contain a well
debugged and polished system, and that it will be further improved
during the lifetime until the LTS end of life in April 2017.

=== This tarball ===

'''Lubuntu_14.04oem-npae.tar.xz'''

is uploaded to make it convenient to manage Lubuntu 14.04 LTS now. There is one '''major tweak''' or work-around to start nm-applet, '''which puts a network indicator onto the panel''' (the 'two monitors' symbol when not connected, the 'arrow up arrow down' symbol when connected via Ethernet (wired) and a 'staircase' when connected via wifi). It is done using a terminal window (lxterminal).

The work-around does not work with the guest user but if the main user stays logged in (and connected via wifi), it should work also for the guest user.

There is an alias, 'TT', to make it easy to toggle the touchpad (in portable computers) to avoid unintented input when there is a mouse. Finally there are two aliases, that make it more convenient, 'l', and safer, 'rm', to use the terminal window.
<pre>
alias TT='touchpad-toggle'
alias l='ls -l --group-directories-first'
alias rm='rm -i'
</pre>

==== Update and dist-upgrade ====

The packages are updated and dist-upgraded to the file date shown at

<nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/one-button-installer/tarballs]]</nowiki>

==== Grub menu visible for easy choice of kernel ====

==== Two kernels ====

The boot option '''forcepae''' was used during the installation and is active, which makes it possible to update and upgrade the non-pae kernel as well as the generic (PAE) kernel.

linux-3.13.0-non-pae '124'
linux-3.13.0-24-generic
</pre>
The non-pae kernel files dated 04-May-2014 21:36 were downloaded from

The non-pae kernel works for old processors without PAE capability. The generic kernel works for
processors with PAE capability (even if there is no PAE flag). The generic kernel is better when
there is more than 2 GB RAM; this is the task of PAE (physical address extension).

==== Files in /home/oem ====

<pre>
clean-myself.bash
truncate-log
fix4oldIntelGraphics.txt
</pre>

==== Tweak for using the new alias 'l' ====

The following code is commented away in '''/etc/skel/.bashrc''' to use alias l from '''/etc/bash.bashrc'''
<pre>
</pre>

==== Tweak for the network indicator ====

The following code is inserted into '''bashrc-extra.txt'''
<pre>
ps -A|grep nm-applet $HOME/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart > /dev/null 
if [  $? -ne 0 ]
then
 if [ "${USER:0:5}" != "guest" ]
 then
  nm-applet  &
  echo 'nm-applet' >> $HOME/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart
 fi
fi
ps -A|grep lxterminal $HOME/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart > /dev/null 
if [  $? -ne 0 ]
then
 if [ "${USER:0:5}" != "guest" ]
 then
  echo 'lxterminal' >> $HOME/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart
 fi
fi
</pre>
before '''alias TT'''

and finally '''bashrc-extra.txt''' is appended to '''/etc/bash.bashrc'''

=== Login information for the user OEM ===

user: oem

password: 123456

So when the system is installed, reboot, run as OEM and tweak the system to what you like, or to what your friend or customer wants, and then click on the desktop icon at the top left corner of the screen! At the next [re]boot, the computer will start a wizard to create the final user.

=== Login as final user ===

The computer will start a wizard to create the final user. The network indicator will appear after the final user has started a '''terminal window''' from the menu or with the hotkey combination

'''ctrl +alt + t'''

This will be automatic after this first instance.

==== Install a new language ====

The end user is given the opportunity to select language, but it will not be installed properly at
the installation via the OEM dialogue (at least not Swedish, that I tested). But when the user
selects (from the main menu in Lubuntu)

'''Preferences--Language Support'''

and installs the relevant language, it will work after the next reboot.

'''Preferences--Keyboard Input Methods'''

The 14.04 LTS 'Trusty' version needs the keyboard layout to be set separately: select the tab 'Input Method', then 'Select an input method' (and select your language), then click the '+ Add' button

Then you can select keyboard with the applet on the panel, and it will survive at reboot.

=== When the bug is fixed ===

When the bug is fixed for the network indicator, the special version of this tarball will be deprecated, so remove the tweak for the network indicator from '''/etc/bash.bashrc''' and '''$HOME/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart'''.

=== Lubuntu_14.04oem-npae5 ===
