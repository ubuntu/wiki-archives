== Introduction ==
Here we will configure openvpn client the following way:
* we will use the daemon(the init script)
* we will get an ip from the openvpn server and not from a dhcp server
run the following command:
 sudo apt-get install openvpn resolvconf
create the /etc/openvpn/client.conf with the following config
 remote 192.168.1.1<<BR>>
 client<<BR>>
 dev tap<<BR>>
 nobind<<BR>>
 tls-client<<BR>>
 ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt<<BR>>
 cert /etc/openvpn/ubu.crt<<BR>>
 key /etc/openvpn/ubu.key<<BR>>
 pull<<BR>>
 verb 4<<BR>>
 remote-cert-tls server<<BR>>
# auth-user-pass<<BR>>
 redirect-gateway<<BR>>
# lladdr 00:FF:00:00:00:24<<BR>>
# route-delay 5<<BR>>
 up "/etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf"<<BR>>
 down "/etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf"<<BR>>

replace 192.168.1.1 by your server's ip address, and replace ubu.crt,ubu.key and ca.crt by your own certificates

run the openvpn server to try: 
 /etc/init.d/openvpn start
then add it to the services that will be started at startup if you want:
 update-rc.d foobar defaults
