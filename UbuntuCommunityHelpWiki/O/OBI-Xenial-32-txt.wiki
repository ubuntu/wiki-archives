Mini text based system with a menu to select installing various light desktop environments

== Comments and links to screenshots ==

This 32-bit system boots in BIOS mode and is suitable for old computers. The boot option forcepae can be used in order to make the system able to install, 'dist-upgrade to', new kernels (within the Xenial kernel series) also with Pentium M and Celeron M processors. It is also suitable for middle-aged and newer computers, but not for new computers that run in UEFI mode.

There are text-mode menus, one main menu for some tweaks and one install menu, where all main Ubuntu family desktop environments can be installed. See also the '''screenshots''' at the following links,
