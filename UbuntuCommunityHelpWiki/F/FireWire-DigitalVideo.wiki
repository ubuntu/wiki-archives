== Capturing Digital Video over FireWire ==
=== Software Requirements ===
You will need dvgrab (and kino) to capture DV footage.
<pre>
sudo apt-get install dvgrab kino
</pre>

When you run 12.04, make sure to create a symlink called 'raw1394' that links to 'fw0' because dvgrab and kino will not be able to capture if not done.
<pre>
sudo ln /dev/fw0 /dev/raw1394
</pre>

You might as well have to give yourself permission to read in the source if this did not do the trick.
<pre>
sudo chmod 664 /dev/raw1394
</pre>

=== Using dvgrab to capture Digital Video ===
After you have installed dvgrab you should be able to capture by using the commandline.
Simply go to your terminal and type in <code>dvgrab</code>, and ther you it, it is capturing in the current folder. If you want to specify the output, have a look at the <nowiki>[[..-dvgrab|dvgrab subpage]]</nowiki>
