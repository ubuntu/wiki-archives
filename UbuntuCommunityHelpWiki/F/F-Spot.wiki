== F-Spot Photo Manager ==

F-Spot is a personal photo manager.

Import your pictures from your hard drive, a digital camera or even an iPod and F-Spot will quickly import them, ready for you to view.

You can tag and categorise your photos, make a Photo CD, export to the online Flickr service, perform basic colour-correction and editing, and much more. Towards the top of the main F-Spot window is a timeline - just drag the slider to view the photos you took around a specific date. There is a fullscreen mode and a slideshow feature for showing your photos to others, and a full image metatdata display for the technically-minded.
