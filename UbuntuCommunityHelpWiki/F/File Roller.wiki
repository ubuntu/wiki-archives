== Introduction ==
-----
Archive Manager (File Roller) is Ubuntu's default application for handling the creation, modification and extraction of <nowiki>[[Glossary#archive|archives]]</nowiki>. File Roller supports a wide range of archive formats, and is well integrated into the Nautilus File Browser. Some formats are <nowiki>[[#nonDefaultFormats|not installed by default in Ubuntu]]</nowiki>.

== Usage ==
----
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="float:inline;" style="border:none;clear:both;"><nowiki>[[File:archive-manager2.png]]</nowiki>
|}

File Roller does not have an application launcher that can be launched by itself due to it's integration with the File Browser. To launch it by itself, press '''Alt+F2''' and type <code>file-roller</code>.

If an archive format is supported, double clicking on the file will automatically open the Archive Manager. You may add files and folders as well as extract existing ones.

Within the File Browser, archives can be created and extracted by using the right click context menu. Existing archives have an Extract Here option, which will extract the archive's folders into the current folder. Selected files and folders have a Create Archive option, which allows you to set where to make the archive and what format it should be.
