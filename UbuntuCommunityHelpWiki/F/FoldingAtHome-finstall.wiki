==== finstall ====
1. Download the finstall script with wget:
<pre>
cd ~
wget -c http://www.vendomar.ee/~ivo/finstall
</pre>

2.#2 Make the script runnable:
<pre>
chmod +x finstall
</pre>

3.#3 Start it:
<pre>
./finstall
</pre>

After the client is installed You can start/stop/... FAH client with ./foldingathome/folding script. For Example(s)
<pre>
~/foldingathome/folding start

or

~/foldingathome/folding stop

or

~/foldingathome/folding status
</pre>

For me this was all I needed as it automatically created the init scripts I needed to start after reboot. However the init scripts don't seem to work for everyone, so if you need to do it manually:

1. Make a file called foldingathome in the /etc/init.d directory:
<pre>
gksudo gedit /etc/init.d/foldingathome
</pre>

2.#2 Paste this in:
<pre>

pushd /home/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/foldingathome/
su YOUR_USERNAME_HERE -c "screen -d -m ./folding start"
popd
</pre>

3.#3 Save and exit

4. Make it start at boot time:
<pre>
sudo update-rc.d foldingathome defaults 99
</pre>
