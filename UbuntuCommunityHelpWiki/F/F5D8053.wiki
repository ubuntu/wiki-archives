Dropping Network Connection
There is a problem in 10.10 Maverick where the network connection drops temporarily every few minutes. It appears to be a collision issue with some drivers. There is an easy fix;

Type in

sudo cp /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist_backup.conf

sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

In the files that opens up add the following lines of text

blacklist rt2800usb

blacklist rt2800lib

blacklist rt2x00usb

blacklist rt2x00lib

Save and close the file. Restart your system and the wireless card will now should be stable and fix the drop issue.
