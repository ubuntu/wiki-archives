__TOC__


The projects listed have been documented over several years to build self-standing Web Browser Kiosks using the LTSP base
 
== Current Packaged Solution for ubuntu/LTSP with the --kiosk option by Oliver Grawert ==
The <nowiki>[[https://wiki.edubuntu.org/HowtoWriteLTSP5Plugins|HowtoWriteLTSP5Plugins]]</nowiki> page describes the details of the current plugin for an ltsp Firefox kiosk. It is installed using an option that is included with the Gutsy/7.10 distribution:

ltsp-build-client --kiosk

There is a <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ltsp/+bug/163278|bug]]</nowiki> that needs to be fixed before running this command (on Gutsy as of 1/31/08)

== Other LTSP based Implementations ==
The following implementation documents describe step-by-step methods that were used to build Web kiosks. They might be considered outdated since they use older versions of LTSP and browsers:

* <nowiki>[[http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/atk/ltsp_kiosk/|Linux-based WWW-Kiosk using LTSP 3.0]]</nowiki> by Matti Lattu
* <nowiki>[[http://www.meadvillelibrary.org/os/ltsp.html|LTSP for Libraries Howto]]</nowiki> by Cindy Murdock

== Even More Implementations ==
With a little bit of searching, you can find lots of Kiosk projects. 

* Jim Massey of JTJ Software keeps the <nowiki>[[http://kiosk.mozdev.org/index.html|Kiosk Project Site]]</nowiki> with a page of <nowiki>[[http://kiosk.mozdev.org/kiosk-links.html|Kiosk project links]]</nowiki>. Some of the LTSP links above are included. 
* Gene Wilburn of the Royal Ontario Museum has a widely replicated <nowiki>[[http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Kiosk-HOWTO.html|Kiosk HOWTO]]</nowiki> from 1999

== Additional Community Kiosk References ==

https://webconverger.org/ is an opensource Firefox based kiosk project, based on Debian stable. <nowiki>[[PXE boot|http:--webconverger.org-pxeboot-]]</nowiki> / LTSP mode of operation is not supported. Instead images are deployed by USB and optionally administered via a simple httpd configuration server that serves INI style configurations that are cached in the case the server is down.
