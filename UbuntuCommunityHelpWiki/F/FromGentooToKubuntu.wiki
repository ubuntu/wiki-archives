== Introduction ==
The basic things that Gentoo users moving to Kubuntu should know are that:

* Kubuntu is, of course, 20x easier to install than Gentoo (yes, you were waiting for that line anyway!).
* Packages for some window managers on Kubuntu use unified Debian menus. Sometimes you do not have to worry about writing your own menus, as it's done for you!
* Do you like making bootsplashes? Kubuntu has a graphical splash screen, for the Gentoo pimper in you!
* Package installation on Kubuntu is much quicker, as it uses binary packages instead of compiling source code.
* By default, there are no root users on Kubuntu. If you are asked for a root password, use your user password instead!

== Getting Used to a GUI That Works ==
The biggest thing that can slow you down when going from Gentoo to Ubuntu is the belief that getting things done requires sitting at the CLI as root, and believing that nothing important can be done at the GUI. To correct this thinking, every time you think, "I need the CLI now," instead go looking for the GUI tool. Chances are that it's there. In Kubuntu these are in "KDE menu -> System Settings". As a simple example, go to "User Management" and you can assign users the ability to use hot-plugged devices by editing their properties. To a Gentoo user, we know that what Kubuntu did was add them to a group in /etc/group, but ain't it nice to have a GUI that knows what we mean!

== Installing New Software ==
In Kubuntu, there are various ways to install new packages. Two of these are by using Adept Manager, a new graphical package manager that uses APT, or the APT program from the command line. The GUI is quick and easy to use, but APT from the command line will be more familiar to former Gentoo users. Using APT is similar to Portage, except it installs binary packages instead of compiling source code.

First, you will need to update your APT repositories, this is similar to "emerge --sync" in Gentoo.
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
</pre>

Then, for example, we will install the Thunderbird mail client. Replace "thunderbird" with your desired package:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install thunderbird
</pre>

This is simliar to <code>emerge thunderbird</code> under Gentoo.

If an application requires new or updated packages, you will be asked if you want to confirm the changes that APT will automatically do. Then, just wait a few seconds and APT will start downloading the packages and install them for you.

== Other key APT commands ==
<code>sudo apt-get install ''package name''</code> - Installs or upgrades the package specified to the newest version

<code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> - Uses APT's abilities to automatically upgrade '''ALL''' packages on the system.

== USE flags? What USE flags? (or "Things You Are Safe To Forget") ==
On Kubuntu, throw all that mumbo-jumbo about USE flags, masked packages and all that other stuff out. All the compilation specifics about Portage are out the window on Kubuntu, so do not worry about it! Also, do not worry about messing with configuration to get stuff to work. APT even automatically updates your configuration when installing stuff, so you do not have to do it!

== I Must Go Root! ==
If you absolutely must, type "sudo -s", and you will be root.  Obviously you must be logged in as that superuser account that was created at login.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> This method is not suggested or supported by the designers of Ubuntu! Use <code>sudo</code> or <code>kdesu</code> instead, as <nowiki>[[RootSudo|this page]]</nowiki> details.

== Managing Repositories ==
There is a file called /etc/apt/sources.list which contains URLs for each "repository" of packages on your system. If you are asked to modify sources or add a repository, this is where to look. <code>kdesu kedit /etc/apt/sources.list</code> will open the file for editing. This file on Kubuntu is commented with information for enabling some repositories, such as Universe and Multiverse.

== "But I still wanna compile stuff!" ==
Do not worry - you can still compile things under Kubuntu, just like on Gentoo.

You can install a package called "apt-build" which builds any package you want and missing dependencies.  It allows you to override the compiler and specify additional compiler options.

If you just need to build a single package, you can run:
* ''' sudo apt-get build-dep ''package'' ''' - to install all missing dependencies for building, then
* ''' sudo apt-get source ''package'' ''' - to get the package source,
* ''' ( cd ''package''* ; dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot ) ''' - to build the package, and finally
* ''' sudo apt-get install ''package''*.deb ''' - to install the newly build package
