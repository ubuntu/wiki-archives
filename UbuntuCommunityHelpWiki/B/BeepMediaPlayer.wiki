== Beep Media Player ==

Beep Media Player (BMP) is a fork of XMMS using the GTK2 toolkit to look a lot nicer. You will need the Universe and Multiverse repositories enabled to install BMP and plugins, see AddingRepositoriesHowto for more information.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install beep-media-player
</pre>

''Note: As of 2005 BMP is no longer being developed. If you are using Ubuntu 7.04 or later, consider using Audacious or BMPx, which are forks of BMP.''

=== Skins ===

BMP is compatible with Winamp 2.x (Classic) and XMMS skins. Ubuntu includes a few skins also, to install them:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install bmp-skins
</pre>

You can also download more skins from <nowiki>[[http://www.winamp.com/skins/|the Winamp skins page]]</nowiki> and place them in "~/.bmp/Skins" to use with BMP.

=== Playlists ===

BMP is capable of using custom playlists. You can create, save and load playlists by clicking on the button located on the bottom right of the "Playlist" screen. 

==== Magnatune ====

BMP supports m3u playlists, which means it can play albums from <nowiki>[[http://www.magnatune.com|Magnatune]]</nowiki>. Simply click on any of the "play hifi" or "lowfi" links and select Beep Media Player to open the .m3u file. At the time of writing the Rock&Pop genre contained almost 800 free songs.

=== Music Plugins ===

There are several plugins needed to play your MP3/MWA etc music files with BMP. Eventually BMP will be moving towards GStreamer however this won't happen in near future (not before GStreamer 0.10/1.0). Hoary and Breezy will still use the normal plugin system for some time to come.

==== Essential Pacakges ====

Before compiling any of the plugins, install the libxml-praser-perl, build-essential and BMP dev packages.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install libxml-parser-perl build-essential beep-media-player-dev
</pre>

==== Mp3 Plugin ====

libmpg123.so is already included with BMP, so it should play .mp3 files out of the box. More information is available at <nowiki>[[RestrictedFormats]]</nowiki>.

==== WMA Plugin ====

There is no WMA plugin available in Ubuntu, but you can compile one yourself:

Download the WMA Plugin
<pre>
wget http://download.berlios.de/bmp-plugins/bmp-wma-0.1.1.tar.gz
</pre>

Extract the files
<pre>
tar -xvzf bmp-wma-0.1.1.tar.gz
</pre>

Enter the directory
<pre>
cd bmp-wma-0.1.1
</pre>

Configure and compile it
<pre>
./configure
make
</pre>

Install it
<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> You cannot play WMA files with DRM.

=== Misc Plugins ===

Before compiling any of these plugins, see Essential Pacakges above.

==== BMP Docklet ====

This plugin lets you control BMP via an icon in your task tray.

Firstly download the plugin:
<pre>
wget http://mark.xnull.de/bmp-docklet/bmp-docklet-1.3.tar.bz2
tar -jxf bmp-docklet-1.3.tar.bz2
</pre>

Enter the directory
<pre>
cd bmp-docklet-1.3
</pre>

Configure and compile it
<pre>
./configure
make check
make 
</pre>

install it
<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>

This plugin can now be enabled under BMP Preferences -> Plugins -> General -> Docklet Plugin

=== XF86Audio Keys, Blur Scope, Blursk, Libvisual, MiniLCD, wmDiscoTux and Crossfade Plugins ===

This plugin is actually a combination of plugins from XMMS. Note that this plugin also includes a Docklet plugin but trying to use it crashes BMP (use the one above instead).

Firstly download the plugin:
<pre>
wget http://www.linuxhd.com/bmp-extra-plugins-0.2.2.tar.bz2
tar -jxf bmp-extra-plugins-0.2.2.tar.bz2
</pre>

Enter the directory
<pre>
cd bmp-extra-plugins-0.2.2
</pre>

Configure and compile it
<pre>
./configure
make 
</pre>

Install it
<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>

You should now have the following plugins:

'''General'''
* Status Docklet Plugin (do not use, crashes BMP!)
* XF86Audio Keys Control

'''Visualization'''
* Blur Scope
* blursk 0.2.2
* Libvisual beep media player plugin 0.2.0
* MiniLCD plugin v.0.2.2
* wmDiscoTux

'''Output (in dropdown)'''
* Crossfade Plugin 0.2.2 

==== Beep Media Library ====

Beep Media Library is a playlist plugin that allows you to do text based searches on filenames. Beep Media Library is not needed for normal playlists in BMP, it is simply an addon feature.

A quote from the home page:

It provides a text field from which you can search multiple directories for files including the string in the text field. Selected files can be played directly or queued up at the end of the playlist. If the last file of the playlist is playing, the BeepMediaLibrary can be set up to add a random file out of the whole library.

Firstly download the plugin:
<pre>
wget http://download.berlios.de/beepmedialib/BeepMediaLibrary-0.12.tar.gz
tar -zxf BeepMediaLibrary-0.12
</pre>

Enter the directory
<pre>
cd BeepMediaLibrary-0.12
</pre>

Compile it
<pre>
make 
</pre>

Install it
<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>

This plugin can now be enabled under BMP Preferences -> Plugins -> General -> BeepMediaLibrary 0.1.1
