__TOC__

BitTorrent is a method of downloading big files. The big file is broken down into smaller parts and it automatically fetches parts from multiple hosts at once. It also shares the parts you've already downloaded with others, so that everybody shares and benefits. It is a good way to download Ubuntu iso releases, especially when the regular release sites are slow, since it actually gets faster when there are lots of users downloading and sharing at once. Bittorrent is considered a Peer-to-Peer(P2P) application. To see other P2P applications, see <nowiki>[[P2PHowTo]]</nowiki>. Ubuntu includes a graphical bittorrent client already installed. Kubuntu includes the KTorrent graphical client already installed.
Also see the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent|Wikipedia article on BitTorrent]]</nowiki>.

=== Using BitTorrent files ===

To start a torrent download, click on a .torrent file in your web browser. The software will then ask you where you want to save the file and keep you updated on the progress. You can also save the .torrent link to a folder. Double-clicking on the .torrent will then open the bittorrent client.

In addition, the program can be launched in Ubuntu (Gnome) by selecting '''Applications->Internet->Transmission'''.

You can also pause or stop a download, and resume it later on.
