=== Overview ===
Disk Usage Analyzer, formerly known as Baobab, is a graphical disk usage analyzer for the GNOME desktop environment. It was part of gnome-utils, but has been a standalone application since GNOME 3.4.

The software gives the user a graphical representation of a disk drive's contents. The interface allows for selection of specific parts of filesystem so a single folder, the entire filesystem, and even remote folders and filesystems can be scanned and listed at folder level.

The graphical representation can be switched between a 'Rings' chart and a 'Treemap' chart to suit the content being viewed.

=== Screenshots ===

These screenshots show an older version of Baobab than is currently available in Ubuntu.

=== Installation ===

Baobab is not installed in Ubuntu by default. It can be installed by issuing the following command in a terminal window:

<pre>
 sudo apt-get install baobab </pre>

or by using a package manager such as 'Ubuntu Software' or 'Synaptic'.

=== Using Baobab (Disk Usage Analyzer) ===

On launching Baobab a list of locations is shown, typically the Home folder, the root folder, other mounted partitions and remote locations such as Google Drive. Selecting a location lists its contents in the left hand panel by displaying the size, contents (number of items) and modification date of each folder.

Selecting a folder will display its contents in a graphical form in the right hand panel as either a 'Rings' chart or a 'Treemap' chart depending on which type of display has been selected. Hovering the mouse pointer over each segment of the chart displays a tooltip showing the folder name and its size.
