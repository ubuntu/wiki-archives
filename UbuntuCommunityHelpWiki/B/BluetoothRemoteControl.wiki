=== Introduction ===
  This page is created to provide configuration files for Sony Ericsson (and any other) phones that support remote control over bluetooth using HID. Other mobile phones can try the <nowiki>[[http://remuco.sourceforge.net/|remuco]]</nowiki> project .

=== Devices ===
  Following Sony Ericsson provide this functionality. <<BR>>
  D750, K320, K510, K530, K550, K600, K610, K660i, K700, K750, K790, K800, K810, K850, S500, S700,  T650, V800, W300, W550, W580, W600, W610, W660, W700, W710, W800, W810, W830, W850, W880, W900, W910, Z520, Z525, Z530, Z550, Z558, Z610, Z710, Z750, Z800 <<BR>>

  {i} Please refer to your handset's manual for usage instructions.

=== Solutions ===
There several possibilities to get remote controller functionality under Linux. First of all there is the the Linux port of the <nowiki>[[http://bemused.sourceforge.net/|bemused server]]</nowiki> and its clients, secondly there is the <nowiki>[[http://remotej.sourceforge.net/|remoteJ]]</nowiki> project, thirdly there is <nowiki>[[http://anyremote.sourceforge.net/|anyremote]]</nowiki>, and of course there is the possibility to use the better documented remote controller of your own phone. This page is primarily about this third alternative.

=== Installation and Configuration ===

* '''Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope)'''

I've tested this on Ubuntu 9.04 and it worked '''out-of-the-box''' for me!

  I. Download your desired .hid file as below.
  I. Ensure both your phone and computer have Bluetooth turned ON and that they are both discoverable (in GNOME, go to Bluetooth icon Preferences -> select "Always visible" or "Temporary visible").
  I. Right click on your downloaded .hid file, then go to "Send To", choose Bluetooth (OBEX Push), and select your phone from the Bluetooth discovered device list. (Your phone should ask you if you want to use the new remote control file, and it should ask you which computer to connect to -- choose your computer and away you go. '''DONE.''' At least that's how nicely it worked for me using Ubuntu 9.04 with my Sony Ericsson K800i without any problem.)<<BR>>

* '''Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala)'''

Works '''out-of-the-box'''. See instructions for Ubuntu 9.04.

<<BR>>
=== Configuration files ===
  The bluetooth remote control configuration file for Sony Ericsson is a tar archive with extension as .hid <<BR>>
  The tar file contains two files <<BR>>
  a) an image containing visual representation of key mappings. <<BR>>
  b) A XML descriptor with extension .kcf that defines key mappings. <<BR>>
  The format of XML descriptor is defined at the Sony Ericsson developer site in a ''Developers Guidelines'' PDF document that is included in the installer for the <nowiki>[[http://developer.sonyericsson.com/wportal/devworld/technology/more/bluetooth|Bluetooth Remote Control tool]]</nowiki>. The document can also be downloaded directly <nowiki>[[http://developer.sonyericsson.com/wportal/devworld/downloads/download/dw-66147-dghidbtr28a?cc=gb&lc=en|here]]</nowiki><<BR>>
  The key codes for HID are defined at <nowiki>[[http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/Hut1_11.pdf|USB website]]</nowiki>

=== Example configurations ===
  By default there are some configurations provided with the phones. Some work with Linux while others do not. <<BR>>
  Following table lists the remote control configuration files specifically made for Linux applications.

| <nowiki>[[attachment:Amarok.zip]]</nowiki>
| Flittermice (flittermice at gmx dot at)
| This HID file is based on the amaroK configuration above, therefore it should work with the phones mentioned above. Maybe you have to size down the background image because I reworked it for the resolution 240x320. I added both a "thumbs up" and a "thumbs down" button for the possibility to increase and decrease a song's rating. The ZIP file contains the source files and instructions on how to install the "rating" function.

| XBMC
| Profiles for phones with resolutions 176x208, 176x220, 222x296, 240x320 (tested on W890i), 480x640, 600x800
| <nowiki>[[attachment:XBMC_remote_profiles.zip]]</nowiki>
| Kim (krosenbohm (at) gmx (dot) net)
| Primarily for music, but also video playback. Contains .svg file adapted from <nowiki>[[attachment:Template222x296]]</nowiki> and a <nowiki>[[http://xbmc.org/forum/showthread.php?t=37336&page=3|shamelessly ripped XBMC logo]]</nowiki> so you can create your own profiles. Some icons were taken from the <nowiki>[[http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project|Tango project]]</nowiki>. If a .hid file isn't working, please repack with tar on Linux: Rename .jpg file with proper resolution to HD-layout.jpg and pack into a .tar file together with Remote.kcf.

| OpenOffice Impress
| K750i,W300i (Not tested with other phones)
| Download <nowiki>[[http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Sony+Ericsson+HID+profiles+package?content=60288|here]]</nowiki>.
| Stani (spe.stani.be on gmail)
| This is a meta package with HID files for OpenOffice Impress, VLC, Amarok, Kaffeine and KDE Desktop. The OpenOffice Impress works fine. I've tested the VLC player but not all keys did work as expected. (Note from Carey O'Shea: The VLC keys should be fine -- the only thing I think that is stopping them working properly all the time is a WxWidgets bug, see here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/vlc/+bug/2772 (ie. disable the "Embed video in interface" option under WxWidgets in VLC options under Interfaces and restart VLC, your video should be in a different window to the VLC controls, but at least your keyboard shortcuts should work properly from then on -- works for me.)

=== Misc ===
  Keymap image templates can be found here: <nowiki>[[attachment:Template176x220]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[attachment:Template222x296]]</nowiki> so that it is easy to create visual representation for key mappings. <<BR>>
  Please note that this template was made according to SE K700i screen resolution and may not fit for other phones.
