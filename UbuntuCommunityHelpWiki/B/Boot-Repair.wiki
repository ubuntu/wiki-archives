'''Boot-Repair''' is a simple tool to repair frequent boot issues you may encounter in Ubuntu like when you can't boot Ubuntu after installing Windows or another Linux distribution, or when you can't boot Windows after installing Ubuntu, or when GRUB is not displayed anymore, some upgrade breaks GRUB, etc.

Boot-Repair lets you fix these issues with a simple click, which (generally reinstalls GRUB and) restores access to the operating systems you had installed before the issue. 

Boot-Repair also has advanced options to back up table partitions, back up bootsectors, create a <nowiki>[[Boot-Info]]</nowiki> (to get help by email or forum), or change the default repair parameters: configure GRUB, add kernel options (acpi=off ...), purge GRUB, change the default OS, restore a Windows-compatible MBR, repair a broken filesystem, specify the disk where GRUB should be installed, etc.

'''This tool is aimed entirely at those new to Ubuntu who want to get past their booting issues and enjoy using Linux. For the purpose of helping the forum and IRC members help you diagnose issues with your boot setup, Boot-Repair creates a <nowiki>[[Boot-Info]]</nowiki> diagnosis for you to share that allows experienced members to see what's wrong with your boot. The tool systematically asks if you want to upload this diagnosis to a pastebin or keep it local. The Pastebin is not easily searchable and automatically expires after some days, but for confidentiality purpose you may prefer to keep the report local.'''

Boot-Repair is a free software, licensed under GNU-GPL.

== Getting Boot-Repair ==

=== 1st option : get a disk including Boot-Repair ===

The easiest way to use Boot-Repair is to create a live-USB disk of <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/p/boot-repair-cd/home|Boot-Repair-Disk]]</nowiki> (a disc starting Boot-Repair automatically), and boot on it.

Remark : it is recommended to install the ISO on a <nowiki>[[Installation-FromUSBStick|live-USB]]</nowiki> (eg via <nowiki>[[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/|UnetBootin]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://www.linuxliveusb.com/|LiliUSB]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/|Universal USB Installer]]</nowiki>). Do not burn it on a DVD if your boot is in <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI|EFI]]</nowiki> mode.

=== 2nd option : install Boot-Repair in Ubuntu ===

- either from an Ubuntu live-session (<nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD|boot your computer on a Ubuntu live-USB]]</nowiki> then choose "Try Ubuntu") or from your installed Ubuntu session (if you can access it)

- connect to the Internet

- open a new <nowiki>[[Terminal]]</nowiki>, then type the following commands (press Enter after each line):

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y boot-repair && boot-repair
</pre>

== Using Boot-Repair ==

 - First click the '''Create a Boot-Info Summary''' button. This will simply create a <nowiki>[[Boot-Info]]</nowiki> diagnosis. A pop-up will ask if you want to upload the report online in order to share it more easily.

 - Check the diagnosis contents. If any doubt, you can share it on Ubuntu Forums (<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/newthread.php?do=newthread&f=333|here]]</nowiki>) along with a description of your boot issue, so that experienced forum members can advise.

 - Once you get green light from experienced forum members, click the '''Recommended repair''' button. When repair is finished, note the new URL ('''paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXX''') that appeared on a paper, then reboot and check if you recovered access to your OSs.

 - If the repair did not succeed, indicate the URL to people who help you by email or forum.

=== Advanced options ===

Warning: the default settings are the ones used by the "Recommended Repair". Changing them in the Advanced options may worsen your problem. Don't change them unless requested by experienced helpers.
