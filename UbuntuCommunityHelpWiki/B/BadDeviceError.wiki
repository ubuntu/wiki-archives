=== Removing the 'BadDevice' Errors ===

This page describes how to get rid of the <code>BadDevice</code> errors when starting a GUI application from a Terminal:
<pre>
X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 170
  Major opcode:  146
  Minor opcode:  3
  Resource id:  0x0
Failed to open device
X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 170
  Major opcode:  146
  Minor opcode:  3
  Resource id:  0x0
Failed to open device
</pre>

==== The Fix ====
To stop these errors from appearing you need to modify your ''/etc/X11/xorg.conf'' file and remove the relevant parts.
First we'll make a backup, just in case.

Open the file by pressing Alt+F2 and putting in:
<pre>
gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</pre>
For Ubuntu, or
<pre>
kdesu kate /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</pre>
For Kubuntu

Then choose '''File -> Save As''' and save it as ''xorg.conf.backup''

Now to change the file, 
Find this part:
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
	Driver		"wacom"
	Identifier	"stylus"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/wacom"
	Option		"Type"		"stylus"
	Option		"ForceDevice"	"ISDV4"		# Tablet PC ONLY
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Driver		"wacom"
	Identifier	"eraser"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/wacom"
	Option		"Type"		"eraser"
	Option		"ForceDevice"	"ISDV4"		# Tablet PC ONLY
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Driver		"wacom"
	Identifier	"cursor"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/wacom"
	Option		"Type"		"cursor"
	Option		"ForceDevice"	"ISDV4"		# Tablet PC ONLY
EndSection
</pre>
and either delete or comment out the lines. (To comment out the lines you put a '#' character at the beginning of each line)
Then find the lines:
<pre>
	InputDevice     "stylus"	"SendCoreEvents"
	InputDevice     "cursor"	"SendCoreEvents"
	InputDevice     "eraser"	"SendCoreEvents"
</pre>
In the <code>Section "ServerLayout"</code> section and delete/comment out those too.

Once you've done that, choose '''File -> Save As''' and save it as ''xorg.conf'' to replace the origional.

You will then have to restart the X server for the settings to take effect. First save anything you are working on and logout, then from the login screen menu choose "Restart the X server", then you can log back in.

=== If Something Went Wrong ===
If, after you chose to restart the X server, you don't get the login screen back, then the you may have not competed the steps properly or just made a mistake somewhere, but that's why we created a backup.

Login to the console and from there run this command:
<pre>
sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</pre>
That will restore your X configuration back to how it was before, then restart the login manager:

In Ubuntu
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
</pre>
In Kubuntu
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart
</pre>
Then you can log back in and try again.
