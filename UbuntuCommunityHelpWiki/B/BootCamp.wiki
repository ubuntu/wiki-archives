=== Bootcamp ===

Boot Camp is the package provided by Apple to enable installing and running Microsoft Windows in a dual booting configuration with OS X on Intel based Macs.

The bootcamp partition space can be used for Ubuntu installation.

The package has a fully featured GUI in OS X 10.5 onwards.

In OS X 10.4 the bootcamp partitioning functions are available from the terminal using diskutil.
