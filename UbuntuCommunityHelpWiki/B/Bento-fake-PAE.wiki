== Introduction ==

'''PAE (Physical Address Extension)''' is explained <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PAE | here]]</nowiki> in details.  

Bento-fake-PAE offers a method to install Bento Remix into computers (mainly if not only laptops) with Pentium M and Celeron M CPUs. Most if not all of these CPUs have PAE capability, but show no PAE flag. This means that these machines can not use any Ubuntu based versions after 12.04 and therefore, Bento with a new kernel can not be installed and their kernels can not be upgraded, because the software is checking for the PAE flag. This can be fixed with fake-PAE, developed by Bernd Kreuss <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~prof7bit/+archive/fake-pae |prof7bit]]</nowiki> and described in the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2113826&p=12504589#post12504589 |Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki>. 

There are many high-quality professional class laptops around with Pentium M CPUs, for example IBM Thinkpad T40, T41 and T42.

Three methods are described to make the new Ubuntu family 32-bit PAE kernels available for Pentium M and Celeron M, that have PAE capability, but do not show the PAE flag.

** Method to start from the Ubuntu 12.04 non-PAE mini-iso file described by mörgæs
** 'grub-n-iso'
** Installed system

== LinuxVillage Bento Ubuntu Remix ==

The Linux Village Bento Ubuntu Remix is described at the following web page

<nowiki>[[http://linuxvillage.org/en/2013/11/bento-ubuntu-remix-rc/]]</nowiki>

=== Bento Fake-PAE ===

The idea is to make it easier for people who want to go directly into a new version of Bento. This is a good alternative for a fresh install (instead of starting from 12.04 and upgrading twice to newer releases).

Right now the image file to download resides on this link

<nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/lubuntu-fake-pae/raring/grub-n-iso]]</nowiki> and will be available at

<nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/bento-ubuntu-remix/]]</nowiki>

==== Test ====

See the description at <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu-fake-PAE#Test]]</nowiki>

Helpful members of the Ubuntu and Lubuntu communities have found that fake-PAE works with almost all Celeron M and Pentium M, and the instructions have been improved.

With your help and support we might be able to add CPU IDs to the list.

== 'grub-n-iso' ==

=== Detailed description ===

You find a detailed description at <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/grub-n-iso | grub-n-iso]]</nowiki>

That page was written primarily for Lubuntu fake-PAE but the information can be used for Bento too.

==== Advantages ====

* Similar to normal installation (via 1GB or 2GB USB drive)
* No upgrading between versions is necessary
* Full flexibility, for example to make a dual boot system
* The standard Bento Remix i386 iso file is used, and can be checked with '''md5sum'''

</pre>
according to <nowiki>[[http://linuxvillage.org/en/2013/11/bento-ubuntu-remix-rc/]]</nowiki>

==== Disadvantages ====

* You must boot from a USB drive or a second hard disk drive (CD/DVD cannot be used)

==== Warning ====

This Bento 'grub-n-iso’ system was made for Pentium M and Celeron M, that have PAE capability but no PAE flag. It is harmless for all computers modern enough to have USB. '''We take no responsibility for any damage, that this software can cause with very old hardware without PAE capability (pre Pentium II)'''.
