== Introduction ==
A '''Boot-Info''' is a diagnosis report that helps detecting anomalies in your system or boot parameters. It is a kind of '''"instant picture of your system"''', it is not a backup.

On the Ubuntu forums, you will often be asked to indicate your '''Boot-Info''', in order to help people understand your problem.

Two methods are recommended to easily create this report:
* from an Ubuntu disc (requires an Ubuntu disc and an internet connection)
* or via a Boot-Repair-Disk (this is the most convenient way if you often create Boot-Info reports, or if the PC to diagnose does not have internet connection)

== Standard method: from an Ubuntu disc ==

  - Boot your computer on an Ubuntu DVD or live-USB, then choose "Try Ubuntu". Once in the Ubuntu session, connect internet, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type the following commands:

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt update
</pre>
<pre>
sudo apt install -y boot-info && boot-info
</pre>

 - click on the '''Online report''' button:

 - write on a paper the URL (e.g., '''paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXXX/''') that appears, then indicate this URL to people who help you by email or forum (e.g. on ubuntuforums <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/newthread.php?do=newthread&f=333|here]]</nowiki>)

== Alternative method: via Boot-Repair-Disk ==

 - Boot your computer on a live-USB of <nowiki>[[https://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/files/|Boot-Repair-Disk]]</nowiki> 64bit (or 32bit if your computer is older than 10 years).

 - When the window below appears, click on the '''Create a Boot Info summary''' button.

 - write on a paper the URL (e.g., '''paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXXX/''') that appears, then indicate this URL to people who help you by email or forum.

== Remarks ==

- the Boot-Info is an instant "picture" of your main system parameters. It does not change the boot nor the system files of the computer. You can redo this procedure any times you want.

- if internet was not connected during the procedure, or if you chose '''local report''', the tool will not indicate an URL, but will display the Boot-Info report in a text viewer. This is less convenient than the URL, as you will have to copy-paste the content of this file on the forums between [CODE] and [/CODE] tags.

- if you forgot to note the URL, redo the procedure.

- once you indicated the URL to someone, people will open this URL in their web browser to see the content of the report.

- the '''suggested repair''' at the bottom of the Boot-Info corresponds to the default repair of the <nowiki>[[Boot-Repair]]</nowiki> utility. If you click the '''recommended repair''' button of Boot-Repair, it will perform these repair operations, then display a log of the repair (which allow to detect some problems that would not be seen via a standard Boot-Info, eg a Flexnet error).

- if you are not in hurry, do not click the '''Recommended repair''' before you get green light from experienced helpers on the forum.
