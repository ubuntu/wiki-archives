== T Mobile Bluetooth dial-up networking ==
This information complements the more generic BluetoothDialup guide.

The <code>/etc/chatscripts/BluetoothDialup</code> file for the cheaper T-Zones (T-MobileWeb) data plan:
<pre>
TIMEOUT	35
ECHO	ON
ABORT	'\nBUSY\r'
ABORT	'\nERROR\r'
ABORT	'\nNO ANSWER\r'
ABORT	'\nNO CARRIER\r'
ABORT	'\nNO DIALTONE\r'
ABORT	'\nRINGING\r\n\r\nRINGING\r'
''	\rAT
OK	'AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","wap.voicestream.com"'
OK	ATD*99#
CONNECT ""
</pre>

This is the <code>/etc/chatscripts/BluetoothDialup</code> file for the full service plans:
<pre>
TIMEOUT	35
ECHO	ON
ABORT	'\nBUSY\r'
ABORT	'\nERROR\r'
ABORT	'\nNO ANSWER\r'
ABORT	'\nNO CARRIER\r'
ABORT	'\nNO DIALTONE\r'
ABORT	'\nRINGING\r\n\r\nRINGING\r'
''	\rAT
OK	'AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet3.voicestream.com"'
OK	ATD*99#
CONNECT ""
</pre>

Note: T-Mobile seems to have made changes to their connection settings during the end of 2006. If for some reason the above isn't working in your area, you can try replacing AT+CGDCONT=1 with AT+CGDCONT=2 above. Also, the data-profile-number might be 2.

Note2: if you connect but you go to a website and it says 
HTTP ERROR: $CODE$
$MESSAGE$
RequestURI=/
than you have to change your proxy settings in firefox to HTTP Proxy: 216.155.165.50 Port: 8080
