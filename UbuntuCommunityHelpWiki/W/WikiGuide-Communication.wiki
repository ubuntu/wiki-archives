== Introduction ==

Good communication with other wiki contributors is essential to writing great resources. Some guidelines:

== General Communication ==

* <nowiki>[[InternetRelayChat|IRC]]</nowiki> - #ubuntu-doc on irc.libera.chat
* Mailing lists - <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-doc|ubuntu-doc]]</nowiki>
* Comments - When saving your edits, always leave a comment so others can easily see what you did.

== Page Categories and Linking ==

* Review - <nowiki>[[Tag|Tag your pages]]</nowiki> when they have not been reviewed, and discuss your contributions on the <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-doc|docteam mailing list]]</nowiki>. If you let us know about it, it can be reviewed more quickly and its tags removed.
* Do not add a link to an unreviewed page on the wiki's index pages (eg. <nowiki>[[UserDocumentation]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[Multimedia]]</nowiki>) until the page has been reviewed and is not tagged.

== Subscribing to Pages ==

* Subscribe to the pages you have contributed to. To do this, click on the Subscribe link of the page you wish to subscribe to.
