== Troubleshooting ==
=== In Terminal ===

Use '''lspci''' to check if this is the right card. What you get back should read as follows:

<pre>
07:00.0 Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. Device 8172 (rev 10)
</pre>

=== Lucid 10.04 ===
As of Lucid 10.04, just update linux kernel from lucid-updates.

=== Karmic 9.10 ===
As of Karmic 9.10, the driver for this card is missing. Realtek provides a Linux-native driver:

* 32-bit (recommended): <nowiki>[[http://launchpadlibrarian.net/33927923/rtl8192se_linux_2.6.0010.1012.2009.tar.gz|link]]</nowiki>
* 64-bit: <nowiki>[[http://launchpadlibrarian.net/34090404/rtl8192se_linux_2.6.0010.1012.2009_64bit.tar.gz|link]]</nowiki>

Instructions for proper installation of the driver are found here: <nowiki>[[http://www.linwik.com/wiki/using+the+realtek+8172+and+8192se+wireless+controller+with+ubuntu+9.10|link]]</nowiki>
