__TOC__

By default, Ubuntu configures the floppy diskette drive (/dev/fd0) so that <<BR>>
* Anyone can mount it, but only the user who mounted it can unmount it
* Only the user who mounted it can write to it

This document explains how to configure Linux so that anyone can mount, unmount, or write to a floppy diskette without restriction, like some other popular operating systems.

Change the floppy diskette drive entry in /etc/fstab file <pre>
sudo nano --nowrap /etc/fstab</pre> from:
<pre>
/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0
</pre> to <pre>
/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto rw,users,noauto,fmask=111,dmask=000  0   0
</pre>

Note that `user` is changed to `users` and the permission masks are specified.  `fmask=111` means for regular files, deny execute permission to all (chmod a-x) and allow all other permissions.  `dmask=000` means for directories, do not deny any permission.

`man fstab` and `man mount` and `man chmod` for more information.
