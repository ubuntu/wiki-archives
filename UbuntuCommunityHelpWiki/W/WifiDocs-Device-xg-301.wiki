ADVENT XG-301 Wireless G CardBus Card

== Infomation ==
This card seems to be a fairly generic wireless G card. Seems to work out of box with version 9.10 of Ubuntu. Appears to support WEP and WPA/WPA2 encryption. I have tried using this for as an access point, but I believe it does not support master mode.
