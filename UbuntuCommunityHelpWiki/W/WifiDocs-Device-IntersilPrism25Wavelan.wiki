__TOC__

The Intersil Corporation Prism 2.5 Wavelan chipset can be found in first-generation IBM ThinkPad R40 notebooks. It won't work with Dapper/Edgy out-of-the-box, because the kernel loads the wrong module---it is best supported by <code>hostap</code>, not <code>orinoco</code>. This can be fixed by adding these lines to <code>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist</code>:
<pre>
blacklist orinoco_pci
blacklist orinoco
blacklist prism2_pci
blacklist hermes
</pre>
This should then give you an <code>wifi0</code> and <code>eth1</code> interface which works great with WPA supplicant---see <nowiki>[[WifiDocs-WPAHowTo]]</nowiki>.

This solution also helped me make the wireless LAN on my IBM ThinkPad A31p run under Feisty. But only after updating the line in <code>/etc/iftab</code> saying <code>wlan0 mac 00:00:0...</code> with the correct MAC-address the NetworkManager worked automatically.
