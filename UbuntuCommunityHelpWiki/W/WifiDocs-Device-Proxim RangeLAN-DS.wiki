__TOC__

Proxim RangeLAN-DS is an 80211.b PCMCIA card, which on the reverse also calls itself "PC CARD 8430, FCC ID: M4Y-XI-300" and says "F/W Rev.: 0.7.6". There is a firmware upgrade available to 0.8.3 which I have applied, availeble at http://www.goonda.org/archive/wireless/prism2

=== Breakage ===
It doesn't work out of the box with Ubuntu 9.04. The graphical interface doesn't show it at all. It's based on the Prism 2.5 chipset and by default Ubuntu 9.04 loads kernel modules "hostap" and "hostap_cs", presents two wireless interfaces "wifi0" and "wlan0", associates these with the wrong ESSID (it should be "SKY93819" but "iwconfig" says it has associated both interfaces with "SKY93819c", and it fails to get an IP address.

<code>lspci</code> doesn't say anything about the card and shows no change when it is plugged in.

=== Fixes ===
To fix it, create <code>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-hostap.conf</code> containing:
<pre>
blacklist hostap_cs
</pre>
then edit <code>/etc/modules</code> and append the line
<pre>
orinoco_cs
</pre>
Now reboot and it'll appear in the usual wireless configurator.

=== Detail ===
The "dmesg" output for the non-working default <code>hostap_cs</code> driver says:
