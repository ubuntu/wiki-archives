==== Network Admin ====

The Networking tool can be found by choosing from the menus <code>System-->Administration-->Networking</code>

<nowiki>[[File:NetworkAdmin1.png]]</nowiki>

(note in Edgy Eft 6.10 there are boxes to the left of the icons that can be checked to activate the devices)

A. This area lists all recognized networking devices. Wireless devices are noted clearly with a title and icon.
** If your device is not listed in this area, then your wireless device does not have a working or functioning driver. To troubleshoot and set up your device with a driver see WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide.

B. Here you can choose which interface is your default gateway. You will want to set this as the interface you use most often.
** If you have two active interfaces, the default gateway will take precedence and could cause problems with internet traffic. It's best to only have one active interface while using the network.

C. After checking the box to enable your wireless interface, it needs to be configured with your network settings.
1. Network name is your access point's essid (extended service set identifier or extended SSID). An essid is just a unique name given to your access point. Each vendor comes preset with a default such as linksys in this example. After you have set up your computer, you should log in to your router and change this so it is unique in order to differentiate your router from a possible neighbor's router.
**** If your device supports scanning, your access points essid should display in the drop down list. Most newer cards and drivers will support scanning.
## If you are using WEP encryption the next box is to set the key type that's set up. Note that you can not set up WPA encryption in a gui environment as of Feb 2006 but it is being developed and will come in the future.
## The next field you simply enter you WEP key. If it is in hexadecimal format, do not input the hyphens ("-"), for example, like this: 393981067DB10531E709 (not 39-39-81-06-7D-B1-05-31-E7-09).

D. The last section is how your interface receives it address and other information.
1. Home  access points by default are set to DHCP. If you stay with option you're done, click ok and then activate in the first screen.

1. You do have the option of setting a static ip. With DHCP you pull from a range of addresses and after a period of time it renews and usually assigns a new address. A static address offers the benefit in a network where you share documents. Other PCs in the network need to know the address and if you use DHCP it is constantly changing so you have to constantly reconfigure the share. With static, you configure it once and you're done.
*** When you set a static ip make sure you use an address within your network framework and it is not in the range of the DHCP address pool.
*** Set your netmask. Home networks are 255.255.255.0 by default but can vary and be changed.
*** Your Gateway address is simply the router's address. By default they are usually 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.2.1 You need to know this and you can find it in your router's manual or written on the router itself.
*** If you set a static ip, you need to go back to the original network window and click on the DNS tab. Here you need to set up your dns setting. If you have a windows pc in your network you can find this by running in a cmd window <code>ipconfig /all</code>
