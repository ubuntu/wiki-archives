This page is a list of important config files used with wireless networking.

== Files ==
=== /etc/network/interfaces ===
This file stores networking interface settings.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/tip.png||align="left"]]</nowiki>Network Manager cannot manage any interfaces that are named in this file. Network Manager has been the default way of managing network connections  since Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex)

* If you are not currently using Network Manager and would like to, delete or comment out (with a <code>#</code> at the start of each line) your interfaces except for the two lines referring to lo (this is an internal loopback). Since Ubuntu 8.10, this file will look similar to this:
 <pre>
## The loopback network interface
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
 }}}
* Do not use an <code>auto</code> stanza if you are using a PCMCIA deivce that you want to start automatically at boot-time. Add <code>map <ath0></code> to the /etc/interfaces file. Your file should contain something similar to:
 {{{
## echo connects ath0 when device is hotplugged. using echo instead of grep allows any device to be brought up when hotplugged. Note this could cause a problem if a device is active and another one that is mapped is plugged in.
  mapping hotplug
          script echo
          map ath0
 }}}
* Check your routers settings to ensure it can accept another connection.
* If you are running Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) or earlier, you should have something similar to this:

 <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/example.png]]</nowiki>
 {{{
## The loopback network interface
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback

## This is a list of hotpluggable network interfaces.
## They will be activated automatically by the hotplug subsystem.
## With lines # out these don't work. If they were removed this would hotplug only eth0 when cable is plugged in with active network
## mapping hotplug
## script grep
## map eth0

## echo connects ath0 when device is hotplugged. using echo instead of grep allows any device to be brought up when hotplugged. Note this could cause a problem if a device is active and another one that is mapped is plugged in.
  mapping hotplug
          script echo
          map ath0

## interface of ath0 device with wep setting (not all these lines are required but show you options that may be needed)
  iface <ath0> inet dhcp
  wireless-essid xxxx
  wireless-key xxxxx
  wireless-key xxxx-xxxx-xx (in certain situations a - is needed after every 4 characters to work)
  wireless-key1 xxxx (add a number after key to specify key number to use.)
  wireless-defaultkey 1 (specifies which key is default)
  wireless-key s:xxx (add s: in front of key if ascii form)
  wireless-key XXXXXXXXXX open|restricted (if using shared/restricted setting add this line)

  auto <ath0>
 }}}

* This file has a manual page. Type <code>man interfaces</code> in a terminal to view it.
* <code>/usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples/network-interfaces.gz.</code> You can read through it with the <code>cat</code> command and then adding <code>| less</code> to the end of the command.

=== /etc/resolv.conf ===
This file stores <nowiki>[[DnsAndDhcp#DNS|Domain Name Server (DNS)]]</nowiki> settings including nameserver addresses, local domain names/search server addresses and some other advanced settings.

* This file has a manual page. Type <code>man resolv.conf</code> in a terminal to view it.

=== /etc/modules ===
This file lists some of the modules that will be loaded into the kernel at boot-time. If a driver won't load at boot, you can add it to this list so that it does. 

=== /etc/modprobe/ ===
To enable specific configuration options for a driver create an appropriate config file in this folder eg. config.conf or [drivername].conf and add the options you want to set in this file.

==== notes ====
With the release of Ubuntu 11.10 and kernel 3.x.x some wireless drivers now no longer need 11n_disable and 11n_disable50 options. Theses options may actually cause the driver to fail to load.  Check the /etc/modprobe.d/ folder for config files that contain option reference to your driver, for example 
{{{
options iwlagn 11n_disable=1 11n_disable50=1
</pre>

These options can be found in config.conf or [drivername].conf file eg. intel_11n_disable.conf or awlagn.conf. 

=== /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist ===
If you don't want a driver to load at boot you add it to this list. Usually this is used if you have a driver conflict and/or you want to make sure a specific driver is used. Note: this method will not work unless the diver is a LKM (loadable kernel module) If driver/module was compiled into the base kernel, it will still load if blacklisted.
