Describe WifiDocs/Device/WifiDocs/Device/DWL-G122 (Rev C1) here.

To make sure that your usb device is the correct, have a look at the information printed on the device. In my case, the model information reads "<code>Model No.: DWL-G122 H/W Ver.:C1 F/W Ver.:3.00</code>" What's important here is that the hardware version is C1 - earlier models are covered by different drivers.

Also note the output of the <code>lsusb</code> command, which, in my case, produces the following line:
<pre>
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 07d1:3c03 D-Link System
</pre>

Check the <nowiki>[[WifiDocs-Driver-RalinkRT73]]</nowiki> page for setup this device.
