__TOC__

Support for this card is not yet in a released version of madwifi (support coming just after the December 7th release).  So you need to build your own madwifi drivers or use ndiswrapper.  My card is the one that appears in Toshiba's A105-S2101 Satellite Series Laptop, and ndiswrapper performance left a lot to be desired.  I built drivers using <nowiki>[[http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/Distro/Ubuntu|the instructions from madwifi for Ubuntu]]</nowiki>.
