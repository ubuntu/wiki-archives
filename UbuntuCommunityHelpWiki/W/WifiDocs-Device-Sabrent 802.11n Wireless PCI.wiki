Describe WifiDocs/Device/Sabrent 802.11n Wireless PCI here.

This card worked out of the box with Karmic Koala. Actually says on the box that it supports Linux as well as Windows and OS X. I think it has a ralink chip. I bought it for about $26 delivered from Tiger Direct. 

Model number is: PCI-802N
