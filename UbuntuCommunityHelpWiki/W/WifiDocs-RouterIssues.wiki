== Wireless Router Issues ==

There are some wireless routers known to have problems with Linux. This section contains workarounds.

=== Linksys RV016 ===

At some point after kernel 2.6.13 there was a change that causes this router not to function correctly under Linux.

==== Issue ====

When not connected through a firewall the system operates correctly. However when connected to a firewall local access works but internet connections begin and fail to continue past a certain point. In a given example, a wget fails after downloading exactly 5,463 bytes.

==== Solution ====

The workaround can be tested by opening a terminal and typing:

<code> echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling </code>

To make the change permanent, open a terminal and type:

<code> gksudo /etc/sysctl.conf </code>

Add the following line to the file

<code> net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 0 </code>
