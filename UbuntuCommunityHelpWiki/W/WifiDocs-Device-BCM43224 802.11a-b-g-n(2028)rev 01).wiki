Describe WifiDocs/Device/BCM43224 802.11a/b/g/n (rev 01) here.
The device installed without issue in a Linux Mint 17.2 Mate install. It has both 2.4 and 5 ghz capabilities and I use the 5 ghz band. Possibly the signal is not quite as strong as with Win 7 but I am not sure. Following is what the system shows about this card, hope it helps:
