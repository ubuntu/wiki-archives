 '''''Do not delete or rename pages unless you really know what you're doing.'''''

Users do not have permission on this wiki to delete or rename pages.  Doing so can sometimes cause accidental, yet major, problems.  This includes, but is not limited to, breaking links within the wiki itself and on the internet, as well as people's bookmarks.

For this reason, deleting and renaming pages on this wiki is restricted to the EditorGroup

If you ''do'' need to delete or rename a page, label it with the appropriate <nowiki>[[Tag]]</nowiki>.

However, before you do so, here are some things to think about:

1. A good alternative to renaming is to insert a redirect from the target page to the original page. See HelpOnProcessingInstructions.

1. You can search for all of the pages containing a link to a specific page by clicking on the title of the page. If you rename or delete a page, you '''MUST''' fix all these links.

1. If you are thinking about renaming a well-known or useful page, please discuss it on the DocumentationTeam <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-doc|mailing list]]</nowiki> first.
