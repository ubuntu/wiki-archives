__TOC__

The Ubuntu Live CD contains a small collection of open source applications for Windows.

Inserting the Live CD while running Windows brings up a browser with some information about each application and the option to install it. The browser uses technology and content from <nowiki>[[http://www.theopencd.org/|TheOpenCD]]</nowiki> project, with a custom Ubuntu skin. There is also a brief introduction to Ubuntu with screenshots.

You can download the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/download/|LiveCD ISO]]</nowiki> or<nowiki>[[http://shipit.ubuntulinux.org/|order free LiveCDs]]</nowiki>.
