== Introduction ==
WebKit is an open source web browser engine. WebKit is also the name of the Mac OS X system framework version of the engine that's used by Safari, Dashboard, Mail, and many other OS X applications. WebKit's HTML and JavaScript code began as a branch of the KHTML and KJS libraries from KDE. This page will help you compile WebKit on your Ubuntu system.

== Karmic and newer ==

Since Karmic, WebKit has been available in the Ubuntu archives as package libwebkit-1.0-2.  It can be launched as a standalone demo (for testing bugs independently of the various browsers that use it) by running /usr/lib/webkit-1.0-2/libexec/GtkLauncher

== Prerequisites ==

You should be familiar with the terminal. Visit <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal|UsingTheTerminal]]</nowiki> to learn more about the terminal.

== Get dependencies ==

WebKit requires a newer version of libsoup than provided by the official Ubuntu repositories. Add the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~webkit-team/+archive/ppa|PPA for WebKit Team repository]]</nowiki> to get access to the right version:

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webkit-team
sudo apt-get update
</pre>

WebKit requires libraries to successfully aquire, configure, and compile. You can get libraries by issuing the following command in your terminal:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install subversion gtk-doc-tools autoconf automake libtool libgtk2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libicu-dev libxslt-dev libsoup2.4-dev libsqlite3-dev gperf bison flex libjpeg62-dev libpng12-dev libxt-dev autotools-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev libenchant-dev libgail-dev
</pre>

== Get the source code ==

To acquire the WebKit source code issue the following command in your terminal:

<pre>
svn checkout http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk ~/src/WebKit
</pre>

Be patient, this step will take some time.

== Compile the code ==

Change the directory in your terminal to the newly created ~/src/WebKit directory with the following command:

<pre>
cd ~/src/WebKit
</pre>

Now you will need to configure the source to be sure all dependencies are present on your system. Issue this simple command in your terminal:

<pre>
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
</pre>

If your ./autogen.sh command runs without any hitches you are ready to compile WebKit. Issue the following command in your terminal and grab a beer: 

<pre>
make
</pre>

To install run:

<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>

== Test WebKit ==

Assuming no errors occurred during the build you can now test WebKit. Launch the demo browser by issuing the following command in your terminal:

<pre>
~/src/WebKit/Programs/GtkLauncher
</pre>

Enter the following URL in the browser: http://acid3.acidtests.org, you should see something like the following image:
