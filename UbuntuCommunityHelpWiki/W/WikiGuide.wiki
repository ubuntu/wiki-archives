__TOC__


== Introduction ==

This page contains guidelines and help on how to contribute to the documentation in this wiki.

== Contributing ==

Anyone can edit the Community Help Wiki. You just need a <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net|Launchpad]]</nowiki> account (see <nowiki>[[Registration]]</nowiki>) and be a member of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wiki-editors/+join|ubuntu-wiki-editors Launchpad team]]</nowiki>. Once your membership has been approved (a confirmation email will be sent in approximately 1-7 days), log out of the wiki and then log back in. Don't forget to tick "Team membership: ubuntu-wiki-editors" when logging back in if asked what information to share.

Please note that there are two wikis where this applies, and to which you need to log in separately:

* https://help.ubuntu.com/community (to which this page belongs)
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com

== Basics ==

If you haven't contributed to the wiki before, these are the best pages to start with.

* <nowiki>[[PageCreation]]</nowiki> - Guidance on creating pages on this wiki
* <nowiki>[[WritingGuide]]</nowiki> - Writing style and conventions that are encouraged on the wiki
* <nowiki>[[DocumentationTemplate]]</nowiki> - Recommended page structure
* <nowiki>[[SandboxPages]]</nowiki> - Info on creating sandbox pages to test wiki pages
* <nowiki>[[Tag|Tags]]</nowiki> - Tags are used to label pages as requiring attention from Wiki Editors
* <nowiki>[[CategoryCategory|Categories]]</nowiki> - A list of categories pages can be listed under

=== Wiki Markup ===

This website is a wiki, and therefore uses wiki markup to define how text should be displayed, to make links to other pages and websites, and to add images to pages. Wiki markup is really easy to learn.

* <nowiki>[[WikiGuide-Formatting]]</nowiki> - Help on getting started with wiki markup.
* <nowiki>[[IconsPage|Wiki Icons]]</nowiki> - describes availability & use of icons in the Ubuntu wiki

This should be enough to get started, but as you get more comfortable with the wiki as and want to try more advanced features, have a look at the "Advanced Reference" section below.

== Further Guidance ==

Once you are familiar with the basics, it is worth familiarising yourself with the following pages.

* <nowiki>[[Communication]]</nowiki> - Communicating with other editors is an important part of contributing
* <nowiki>[[DeletingAndRenaming]]</nowiki> - Advice on deleting and renaming pages
* <nowiki>[[Screenshots]]</nowiki> - When and how to use screenshots
* <nowiki>[[Tag]]</nowiki> - Tags are used to mark the status of pages

== Getting Involved ==
The Ubuntu wiki is maintained by the Ubuntu documentation team (i.e. there's no distinct Ubuntu wiki team).

See the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/Wiki|Ubuntu Documentation Team Wiki page]]</nowiki> for further information.

== Advanced Reference ==

If you use the wiki on a regular basis, you will want to check out the following pages which give more detail about how to use advanced features of the wiki and provide useful functions.

* HelpForUsers - Basic landing page for advanced information about the wiki
* HelpOnActions - Learn all about the options available in the drop-down box when editing
