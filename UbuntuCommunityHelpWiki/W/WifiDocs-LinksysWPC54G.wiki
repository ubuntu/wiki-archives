'''This How To explains the setup of Linksys cards that require the ndiswrapper module.'''

Follow these steps:

1. Link to ndis page Ndiswrapper

      These instructions for Debian have been helpful for several people configuring linksys cards Arthur's homepage: <nowiki>[[http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/wpc54g/|using WPC54G with Debian]]</nowiki>
2. The Linksys WPC11 ver 4 is a confirmed success.
3. In one case at least, manually entering nameserver information into /etc/resolv.conf was required.

Here is a step-by-step instruction, which workes very well on IBM Thinkpad with WPC54GS (BMC Chipset) card:
First, download <nowiki>[[http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_CASupport_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1166859842300&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=4230058334B317&displaypage=download|the non-free drivers]]</nowiki>. Unzip the drivers somewhere in your home-directory.
Then install bcm43xx-fwcutter and use it to get the firmware stuff needed for ndiswrapper:
<pre>
apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter ndiswrapper-utils-1.8 ndiswrapper-common
cd ~/windows_drivers/
bcm43xx-fwcutter bcmwl5.sys
cp bcm43xx* /lib/firmware
modprobe ndiswrapper
ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf
ndiswrapper -l
</pre>
Depending on the driver package used, bcmwl5.inf and bcmwl5.sys can be on different places in the subdirectories...

should show the following:
<pre>
bcmwl5     driver installed, hardware present
</pre>
Then edit /etc/network/interfaces to contain the following. Alternatively you can just use the gnome or kde configuration tools:
<pre>
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet dhcp
wireless-essid linksysgabba
wireless-key 0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A
</pre>
Of course you use your ESSID and WEP-KEY then ;-)

As next, you take up the interface:
<pre>
ifdown eth0
ifdown eth1
ifup eth1
</pre>

Wait until dhcp gets it's stuff and then test it (browse google)
