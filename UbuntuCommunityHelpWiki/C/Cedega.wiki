Cedega allows many popular Windows games, including Battlefield 2, Half-Life 2, and World of Warcraft to be played under Linux.

== Acquiring Cedega ==
Cedega is a proprietary product, that must be purchased (currently $5.00 per month with a 3 month minimum initial purchase) from http://transgaming.com for full functionality. It is a fork of the <nowiki>[[Wine]]</nowiki> project, which is available under a free and open source license.

You can use a CVS version of Cedega (this is free), instructions on how to install this are at http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=HOWTO+Cedega+CVS

Under Edgy and above, you will need to type <code>bash WineCVS.sh</code> instead of <code>sh WineCVS.sh</code>, as the script uses features that are specific to the bash shell.

If the link to the script doesn't work, you can use this one: http://winecvs.linux-gamers.net/WineCVS.sh

== How To Install Cedega ==
Install the debian file:
<pre>
sudo dpkg -i cedega_[version].deb
</pre>

== Installing a Game Using Cedega ==
=== Installing from CD or DVD ===
Locate the correct installer executable and install the game using:
<pre>
cedega  /media/cdrom/setup.exe  
</pre>
Assuming your cdrom is mounted to <code>/media/cdrom</code> and the installer is named <code>setup.exe</code>

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/tip.png]]</nowiki> You may experience some graphical errors during the copying process. These are generally not harmful.

=== Installing from the HD ===
If you have enough free space, you can copy the content of each CD in <code>Transgaming_Drive</code> in your home directory. In that case, you don't encounter the cd changing problem.
<pre>
cd ~/TransGaming_Drive
</pre>
Locate the correct installer executable and install the game using:
<pre>
cedega setup.exe
</pre>

=== Multi-Disc Installers ===
You should run the installer with the <code>-monitor-cdrom-eject</code> option, and then you may press the eject
button on CD-RW or DVD drives and the disc will unmount and eject automatically.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> Care should be taken when enabling this option on systems which have compact flash drives.

== Playing a Game Using Cedega ==
There are three methods for starting a game once it has been installed.
=== Using the Desktop Icon ===
Some games will create a desktop icon during the installation process. 
If you wish to pass special options to Cedega or the game, edit the desktop shortcut.

=== Using the Start Menu ===
Some games will add a link to the start menu. Simply click the start menu, go to <code>TransGaming -> Programs</code> and then the game name/vendor and select the game icon.  
If you wish to pass special options to Cedega or the game, edit the menu item shortcut.

=== Using the Command Line ===
Enter the Game Directory:
<pre>
cd ~/.transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/[Game Directory]
</pre>
Start the game:
<pre>
cedega [wine options] game.exe [game options]
</pre>
Options can be passed to both Cedega and the game using the command line.

Important options for Cedega are:
<code>-bigexe</code>: 
        This option is required for executables of a "large" size. Typically this is only for demo installers who come packaged in one large executable.

<code>-use-pthreads</code>:
        A way to override the use of pthreads. This option should be automatically set by Cedega, however, if problems exist it may be useful to change the pthreads option. Acceptable values are yes or no.

<code>-monitor-cdrom-eject</code>
        Enables the CD eject polling functionality. This option is off by default and typically only needs to be enabled for some multidisk installers.
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> Care should be taken when enabling this option on systems which have compact flash drives.

== Play a game without CD ==
You can get NO-CD PC Games fixes from <nowiki>[[http://www.megagames.com/|MegaGames]]</nowiki>

== Configuring Cedega ==
To edit the Cedega configuration settings open <code>~/.transgaming/config</code> in your favorite text editor.
For more details read the supplied Cedega_howto txt file!

== Troubleshooting ==
=== OpenGL Support ===
To test your graphics card for OpenGL support execute the following command:
<pre>
glxinfo | grep 'direct rendering'
</pre>
output will return "direct rendering:"

If this is 'Yes' or 'Enabled' then OpenGL is likely set up correctly.  If it is listed as 'no' or 'disabled' then double check your 3D setup.

=== Performance Test ===
Run the glxgears program:
<pre>
glxgears
</pre>

A window will be displayed with 3 rotating gears. If 3D acceleration is correctly enabled for your video card then the reported framerate should be well over 500 FPS, at the default window size. If the output shows less than 500 FPS then you should double check your 3D setup.

=== Multiple OpenGL libraries ===
Check if you have multiple OpenGL libraries:
<pre>
locate libGL
</pre>
This will display any OpenGL libraries you have on your system. In particular, you should be cautious of having libGL in both /usr/lib as well as in /usr/X11R6/lib.  Sometimes, the software-only Mesa OpenGL libraries are installed in /usr/X11R6/lib and hardware accelerated drivers are installed elsewhere.  We do not recommend removing the Mesa libraries from /usr/X11R6/lib unless you are seeing slow rendering in games running under Cedega.

=== CD Drives and Mountpoints permissions ===
Many Windows games use copy protection systems that require Cedega to have 'read' access to your CD-ROM device, as well as 'read' and 'execute' access to your CD-ROM mount point.
Change permissions:
<pre>
sudo chmod a+r [CD-ROM Device]
sudo chmod a+rx [CD-ROM mount point]
</pre>

Check for symbolically linked devices and change the permissions
<pre>
ls -la [CD-ROM Device]
</pre>

=== User Access on CD-ROM mountpoint ===
Under some circumstances, you may need to edit your <code>/etc/fstab</code> file to ensure that all users have access to the CD-ROM mount point.

=== Graphic Problems ===
Games often attempt to change your screen resolution to fit their needs. Make sure that the 'Screen' section of your <code>xorg.conf</code> or <code>XF86Config-4</code> file has a number of resolutions.  The most common resolutions are: 1600X1200,  1280X1024, 1024X768, 800X600, 640X480. If the game is not running at full screen check the game settings to see what resolution it is attempting to use and make sure that resolution is listed in the <code>xorg.conf</code> or <code>XF86Config-4</code> file.  	

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/tip.png]]</nowiki> You may experience improved performance with some games when running the X server at 16 bit color depth.

=== Sound Problems ===
If you are having sound problems make sure to disable any sound servers or other applications that may be using sound, such as 'xmms'.

=== Free space limitations ===
Some systems may be set up with restrictive space quotas on the /home directory. You may experience problems installing games if the available space is reported incorrectly, or if there is not enough space
available on your system:
<pre>
disable quotas 
</pre>
or 
<pre>
symbolically link to a device with more free space available.
</pre>

=== Low Framerate ===
If you only get 15-30 fps
<pre>
renice 17 -p `pgrep wineserver`
</pre>

=== No 3D acceleration in 64bit version Ubuntu ===
In glxgears you get good results, but cedega's 3D test failed and games are slow. 
Set enviroment variable:
<pre>
export LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=/usr/X11R6/lib32/modules/dri/:/usr/lib32/:/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/:
/usr/lib/
</pre>
