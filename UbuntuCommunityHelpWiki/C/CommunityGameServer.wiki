So looking at this sample it would work like:
* 1st game would be Tremulous and start on Sunday @ 05:00 UTC
* It would go down @ 04:59 UTC on Monday.
* Monday will be a "maintenance day"
* @ 05:00 UTC on Tuesday Warsow would start up.
* So on and so on.
* Games deemed to be low intensive would run all the time except for Monday.

| <style="border:#333333 1px none"> '''Tremulous''' is a free, open source game that blends a team based First Person Shooter (FPS) game with elements of a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game. Players can choose from 2 unique races, aliens and humans. Players on both teams are able to build working structures in-game like a Real Time Strategy game. These structures provide many functions, the most important being spawning. The designated builders must ensure there are spawn structures or other players will not be able to rejoin the game after death. Other structures provide automated base defense (to some degree), healing functions and much more...
|}

Player advancement is different depending on which team you are on. As a
human, players are rewarded with credits for each alien kill. These credits
may be used to purchase new weapons and upgrades from the "Armoury". The alien
team advances quite differently. Upon killing a human foe, the alien is able
to evolve into a new class. The more kills gained the more powerful the classes
available.

The overall objective behind Tremulous is to eliminate the opposing team. This
is achieved by not only killing the opposing players but also removing their
ability to respawn by destroying their spawn structures.

| <style="border:#333333 1px none"> '''Nexuiz''' is a fast-paced 3D deathmatch game with high-end and complex graphics effects. It is intended to be played over the Internet or over a local network. Several different game types, such as classic deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag are available. Though it also supports a single-player mode and playing against the computer.

The game brings deathmatch back to the basics, with perfect weapon  balancing
and fast paced action, keeping itself away from the current trend of realistic
shooters.
