== Introduction ==
One issue people run into when attempting to <nowiki>[[UpgradeNotes|upgrade]]</nowiki> is conflicts with software installed from sources other than Ubuntu. If you "clean" your system by removing this software first, the upgrade will often go more smoothly, and the extra software can be reinstalled later .

This process only works for software installed via packages (.deb files, installed with apt, synaptic, gdebi, etc.) If you installed anything via other means (.tar.gz, .bin, etc.) it will have its own means of uninstallation.

== Preparing for the Upgrade ==
=== Update the System ===
Make sure you have downloaded and installed all updates through the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/keeping-safe/C/updates.html|Update Manager]]</nowiki>.

=== Remove Obsolete Packages ===
Start <nowiki>[[SynapticHowto|Synaptic]]</nowiki>. Click on the '''Status''' button in the lower left, then '''Installed (local or obsolete)''' in the list above. The package list on the upper right will list all the packages that Synaptic does not know about. Normally this will be quite short and may even be empty. ''You will not be able to reinstall these packages without figuring out where they came from!'' Make a note of any packages that you want to have after the upgrade, then remove all the obsolete packages (right-click, '''Mark for Complete Removal,''' then click the '''Apply''' button at the top.)

=== Remove Third-Party Packages ===
Select '''Filters''' from the '''Settings''' menu. Click '''New''' and name the filter `Installed Third Party` (at the top). On the '''Status''' tab, make sure only '''Installed''' is selected.
<nowiki>[[File:cleanupgrade-status.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
Under '''Section''', choose '''Exclude Selected Sections''' and make sure nothing is selected.
<nowiki>[[File:cleanupgrade-section.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
Finally, under '''Properties''', click '''New''', choose '''Origin''' from the drop-down, select '''Excludes''', and type `.ubuntu.com` (don't forget the leading .).  In some versions of Synaptic, you may need to choose '''OR''' under '''Boolean operator between property criterias'''. <nowiki>[[File:cleanupgrade-properties.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
Click '''Ok'''.

Back in the main Synaptic window, choose '''Custom Filters''' on the lower left and '''Installed Third Party''' in the list above. (Again, it is possible that this list will be empty.) Make a note of the listed packages ("to reinstall later"), then remove them all (right-click, '''Mark for Complete Removal,''' then click the '''Apply''' button at the top.) ''Be very careful at this step.'' If marking something for removal results in a long list of packages that will be removed, do ''not'' mark it for removal just yet and write its name down as a "problem package". This sometimes happens if you're using a PPA that provides a different version of software that Ubuntu needs to work properly.

Choose '''Repositories''' from the '''Settings''' menu. Click on the '''Third-Party Software''' tab. Make sure that nothing is selected (all the checkboxes are empty.) Click '''Close'''. You may receive a messages that the repositories changed; click '''Close''' on that window. Now click '''Reload''' in the main '''Synaptic''' window.

=== Install Standard Ubuntu Components ===
==== Reverting Nonstandard Versions ====
If you had no "problem packages" above, skip to "Install ubuntu-desktop" below. Otherwise, click '''Status''' in the lower left and '''Installed (local or obsolete)''' above. Your problem packages should show up here. You have the option of ignoring this and trying to proceed with the upgrade or trying to fix it. Either way may cause problems

If you elect to fix it, click on the package's name and choose '''Force Version...''' from the '''Package''' menu. There should be two options: choose the one that is not labelled '''(now)''' and click '''Force Version'''. (If there are not exactly two options, click '''Cancel'''...fixing it will not be easy so it's best just to proceed.) Click '''Apply'''. 

==== Install ubuntu-desktop ====
Now choose '''All''' in the left pane and search for `ubuntu-desktop` (if you are on a server, search for `ubuntu-standard`). If this package is not already installed, right-click, '''Mark for installation'''. Click '''Mark''' on the window that pops up, then click '''Apply''' in the main Synaptic window. This may take a while.

=== Perform the Upgrade ===
Run Update Manager and <nowiki>[[UpgradeNotes|upgrade]]</nowiki>.

=== Reinstall third-party software ===
Run Synaptic. Choose '''Repositories''' from the '''Settings''' menu. Click on the '''Third-Party Software''' tab. Re-enable the repositories you want to use; you may need to edit them and change '''Distribution''' to your newly-updated version of Ubuntu (e.g. change '''jaunty''' to '''karmic''' if updating from Ubuntu 9.04 to Ubuntu 9.10.)

Now reinstall whatever software you would like from your "to reinstall later" list.
