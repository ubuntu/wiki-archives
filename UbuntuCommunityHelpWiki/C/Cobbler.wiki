== Introduction ==

Ubuntu uses cobbler as the preferred provisioning server for Ubuntu machines. Cobbler can be used to deploy Ubuntu Server for both, bare-metal machines and Virtual Machines. PXE Booting is the method used to deploy Ubuntu Server in bare-metal. Virtual Machines can be deployed both with PXE booting, and with koan, which is part of cobbler.
