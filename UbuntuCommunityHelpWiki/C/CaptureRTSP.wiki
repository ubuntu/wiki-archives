== Introduction ==

RTSP is a common RealPlayer format for audio and video streams. Neither RealPlayer or VLC (the other commonly used stream recorder) are capable of copying this format.

== Install Required Software ==

Required software packages are:
<pre>
mplayer, w32codecs, lame, sox, ffmpeg, libdvdcss2
</pre>
Use the following command in a terminal:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install mplayer w32codecs lame sox ffmpeg libdvdcss2
</pre>
== Capture Stream ==

Find the RTSP address you want to capture.

Open a terminal and use the following command:
<pre>
mplayer -dumpstream -dumpfile "<file name>.rm" "<RTSP address>"
</pre>
Example:
<pre>
mplayer -dumpstream -dumpfile "MyVideoFile.rm" "rtsp://a347.v78708.c7870.g.vr.akamaistream.net/ondemand/7/347/7870/v0001/mitstorage.download.akamai.com/7870/3/3.091/f04/video/ocw-3.091-lec03-220k.rm"
</pre>
The capture process will take as long as the actual video lasts.
