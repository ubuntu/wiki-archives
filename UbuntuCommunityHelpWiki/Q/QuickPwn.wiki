== Introduction ==
QuickPWN is a jailbreaking application for an Apple iPhone or iPod Touch. As of 12/10/2010, Windows and Linux versions of the software that QuickPWN host are available for device firmware versions up to v4.1.

From Wikipedia:

   ''"Jailbreaking is a process that allows iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch  users to gain root access and unlock the operating system thus removing any limitations imposed upon them by Apple. Once jailbroken, iPhone users are able to download many extensions and themes previously unavailable through the App Store via installers such as Cydia. A jailbroken iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch is still able to use the App Store and iTunes."''
Jailbreaking is necessary if you want to use an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch with Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) or earlier to synchronize music.
