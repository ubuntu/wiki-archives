== Introduction ==
Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core -- much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical.

In addition to this unique feature, we aim to bring a pleasurable, comfortable chatting experience to all major platforms (including Linux®, Windows®, and MacOS X® as well as Qtopia-based cell phones and PDAs), making communication with your peers not only convenient, but also ubiquitous. 

== First Steps ==
Open Quassel IRC by clicking on the KDE button at the bottom-left corner of the screen and navigate to Applications -> Internet -> Quassel IRC.
