This functions don't work with the mentioned versions, but update fixes all issues.

* right hand side Card reader not hot-plug-able (10.04 LTS)
* touch pad scrolling not working / touchpad tab missing in mouse preferences (10.04 LTS)

===== RH Card Reader hot-plug =====

a combination of adding these pciehp options to /etc/default/grub:

<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="pciehp.pciehp_force=1 pciehp.pciehp_poll=1 elevator=noop quiet splash"
</pre>

and the advice from an older version of <nowiki>[[AspireOne-110L#Card Readers|these pages]]</nowiki>: 

Create a file /etc/modprobe.d/aspireone.conf with the following content:
<pre>
options pciehp pciehp_force=1
install sdhci for i in 2381 2382 2383 2384; do /usr/bin/setpci -d 197b:$i AE=47; done; /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install sdhci
</pre>

Add the following line to the end of you existing /etc/modules file:
<pre>
pciehp
</pre>

..seems to have fixed the RH Card Reader hotplug for me on 10.04

== 10.10 ==

=== Works out of the box ===

* Screen
* Keyboard
* Touchpad (one finger scrolling working)
* WLAN / Wireless internet
* Ethernet / Wired internet
* Audio
* Microphone
* Webcam
* Suspend/Resume
* Hibernate

=== Minor problems ===

* both card readers only work if system is booted with card inserted, or
* insert card and issue 'sudo echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan' to force a rescan of the PCI bus, which makes the card slot available

==== Recommendations ====

Add this to your /etc/rc.local to enable Acer Aspire One Fan driver fan control:

  echo -n "enabled" > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/mode

* if system is started after hibernate, the display is garbled

==== Recommendations ====

Configure modprobe options to enable Acer Aspire One Fan driver fan control:

<pre>
echo "options acerhdf kernelmode=1" >> /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf
modprobe -r acerhdf
modprobe acerhdf
</pre>

You can also specify the fanon and fanoff temperatures as well as the polling interval of the temperature sensor with the following options to acerhdf:
* fanon (millidegrees)
* fanoff (millidegrees)
* interval (seconds)

You can check the temperature reported by the sensor with

<pre>
cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
</pre>
