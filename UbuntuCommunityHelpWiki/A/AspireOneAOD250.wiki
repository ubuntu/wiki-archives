This help wiki is for the '''Acer Aspire One D250''' series; it also applies to the '''eMachines eM250''' series. The two netbooks are essentially the same, with the exception of the following-- the D250 shipped with a 6-cell battery and an 160GB HDD, whereas the eM250 shipped with a 3-cell battery and a 250GB HDD. The bottom of the netbooks (for both brands) may list the model number as '''KAV60'''.

There is a good possibility that this help page also applies to the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne/AOA150|A150]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne/D150|D150]]</nowiki> models. Also, if you have already tested the D250, please us help update the  release sections on this page.

=== Works Immediately ===
* Ubuntu Netbook Remix(UNR) is an alternate desktop for netbooks. It can be installed primarily or the system switched back and between UNR and standard desktop.  It does work on the AOD250, but personal testing was very limited when writing this.
* Fn-Hotkeys seem okay. (brightness adjustable but visual feedback not 100% correct - some delays)
* Card reader was tested through several suspend and resume cycles and appears to function properly.
* Everything else (not mentioned below) works out of the box.
=== Requires a Work-Around ===
* The internal wired network card requires drivers to be downloaded and installed (<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/363691|LaunchPad Bug #363691]]</nowiki>)
* The internal microphone requires ALSA to be downloaded and installed.
* Webcam - The package ''luvcview'' needs to be installed.
==== Fixing Wired Network ====
* Updating the kernel version to 28.16 has been reported to fix the ethernet issue.
** To update the kernel, you will have to use the update manager from a wireless connection.
** Alternatively, if you do not have access to a wireless network, you may also download the kernel .deb files using another computer, and then use the dpkg --install command to update them in the D250. But the following method to restore ethernet is simpler in that case.
* Installing wired network drivers
** Download AR81Family-linux-v1.0.0.10.tar.gz from http://partner.atheros.com/Drivers.aspx and install it manually. (This assumes it is downloaded to a directory /home/user/atheros where user is your login name.)
** Under Applications -> Accessories click "Terminal"
** Type the following lines in the terminal:
<pre>
cd /home/user/atheros
gunzip AR81Family-linux-v1.0.0.10.tar.gz
</pre>
''Ignore gzip warnings about "trailing garbage" and continue with the following lines:''
<pre>
tar xvf AR81Family-linux-v1.0.0.10.tar
cd src/
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe atl1e
</pre>

==== Fixing the microphone ====
Microphone doesn't work out of the box. Two options exist. The first was confirmed to work on some versinos of the D250, The second option downloads and installs alsa-driver-1.0.20.  This worked even after a few suspend and resume cycles.

Extra note: The hardware sends left and right channels inverted to each other, ALSA sees the internal mic as a mono device and mixes them. Before anything else, try unlocking the two capture channels and setting left on full and right to off. This can be done in alsamixer or pavucontrol.

===== Option One - Attempt to enable the microphone =====
Under Applications => Accessories click "Terminal". Then type the following lines in the terminal:
<pre>
cd /etc/modprobe.d
ls alsa-base.conf; echo $?
</pre>
If the output is the file name and '0', the file exists.  Back-up the file prior to modifying it.
<pre>
sudo cp alsa-base.conf .alsa-base.conf.bkup
</pre>
If the file exists, execute the following command to add the line to fix the microphone:
<pre>
sudo bash -c "echo 'options snd-hda-intel model=acer-aspire position_fix=1' >> alsa-base.conf"
</pre>
Reboot the computer, and test the microphone.

'' If the test fails, restore the file you modified with the backup, proceed with option two. ''
===== Option Two - Update/install ''alsa-driver'' =====
Under Applications => Accessories click "Terminal". Then type the following lines in the terminal:
<pre>
wget ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsa-driver-1.0.20.tar.bz2
tar xjvf alsa-driver-1.0.20.tar.bz2
cd alsa-driver-1.0.20
sudo apt-get install build-essential module-assistant
sudo m-a update
sudo m-a prepare.
./configure --with-cards=all
make
sudo make install
</pre> 
Now reboot your computer. Click on the volume control(speaker icon). Click the "Volume Control" button in the pop-up menu. Under the options tab, be sure that "Input source" is set to "mic" and not "front mic".

=== Will not Function ===
* The wireless network switch and indicator light does not work.

== Installing Ubuntu ==
This section is meant to be a guide for a complete beginner. The guide was written (August 24 2009) as an actual install was being performed, so results should be repeatable.  Notes are added any place something was not tested during writing.

=== Setting up the installation media ===
Since the AOD250 lacks a internal cdrom drive, you will need to install using a USB stick or have a USB cdrom drive.

==== If you have an external USB cdrom drive ====
* You will need to download the Live Desktop CD <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/GetUbuntu/download|from here]]</nowiki> and burn the image to a cdrom.

Or

* CDs can be ordered for free(long wait) from <nowiki>[[https://shipit.ubuntu.com/|Shipit(Choose Desktop)]]</nowiki> or boughten quicker from  <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuDistributors|UbuntuDistributors]]</nowiki>

* Continue at "booting the install media"

==== To set up a USB stick ====
You have a couple of options.

===== Make a USB stick on a PC with a CD burner =====
** Follow the above "If you have a external USB cdrom drive" section.

** Boot the PC with the CD.

** Under System => Administration select "USB Startup Disk Creator"

** Under "source" select your CDrom drive containing the Ubuntu CD

** Under "USB disk to use" select the USB stick.  WARNING This will destroy all contents of the USB stick

** Click Install

** Continue at "booting the install media"

===== Make a USB stick without a CD =====

  You have 2 options again.
1. Ubuntu Standard Desktop: Go <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles|here]]</nowiki> and follow instructions on page.
2. Ubuntu Netbook remix(UNR): Go <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles|here]]</nowiki> and follow instructions on page.

** Continue at "booting the install media"

=== Booting the install media ===
You computer might not be set by default to boot from USB devices.  Here are the steps to correct that.

* Insert USB cdrom or stick.

* Hold F2 down while turning on the computer.

* Right arrow over to the boot menu and press enter.

* Cursor down to USB HDD or USB CDROM depending on if you're using a cdrom or USB stick.

* Press F6 until your selection is at the top of the list.

* Press F10

* Select yes at the prompt and press enter.

Computer should reboot to the USB device.

=== Booting the Live CD ===
The Live CD is quite straight forward and self explanatory.  Since this is intended to be a guide for complete beginners, it will be explained step by step.  Self explanatory steps are included for continuity.

* Select your language, press enter.

* Select "Try Ubuntu without changing your computer", press enter

* Wait for system to load.

* To connect to the internet through wireless: Left click the network icon(four vertical bars to the left of the speaker icon) and you should see you network listed, click it should connect.

At this point you can use the live system. Some things like Flashplayer and Java are not installed yet so some websites won't work properly, but you can still surf the net while installing Ubuntu to your hard drive during the next step.

=== Running the actual install to the harddrive ===
The installer is quite straight forward and self explanatory.  Since this is intended to be a guide for complete beginners, it will be explained step by step.  Self explanatory steps are included for continuity.

* Under System => Administration select "Install"

* Select your language, click "next".

* Select your timezone, click "forward"

* Select your keyboard, click "forward".

==== Partitioning your harddrive ====
This is where you decide how much space on your harddrive to take from Windows XP and make available to Ubuntu.  There are 3 options available.  

1. "Install them side by side" is probably the option you want. It sets up Ubuntu so you can run Ubuntu and Windows by selecting either when turning the computer on. At the bottom is a slider that allows you to select how much disk space you want removed from Windows and set up for Ubuntu.  

2. "Use entire disk" this option will remove Windows and use the entire disk for Ubuntu.  Do not use this unless you are willing to loose Windows and all data on the computer.

3. "Specify partition manually"  Use this only if you know what you are doing, it is beyond the scope of this page.

* After you make your selection, click "forward".

* At the warning message, click next.

==== Finishing up the install ====

Wait for the drive to be prepared. Time varies depending on options.

* Fill in the page with your information, click "forward"

* Click install.

This process takes around 13 minutes.

* At the prompt, click "continue testing"

* Shut-down computer and remove USB device.

Ubuntu is now installed.

== System Tweaks ==
The following are preferences that may come in handy with the Acer Aspire D250 / eMachines eM250.
=== Touchpad Tweaks ===
The AAO touchpad is quite easy to bump while typing. The best fix is to disable all scroll and tap commands for 1 second after each keystroke. Go to System -> Preferences and select "Startup Applications". Click the add button and add an entry:
<pre>
Name: Syndaemon
Command: syndaemon -d -t -i 1
Comment: Disable trackpad while typing
</pre>
The '1' can be changed to any decimal number, and defines the amount of time to lock the trackpad after each keystroke. See the Syndaemon man page for full details.
=== Checking the volume settings ===
Maximum volume was too low after install.  To check the mixer settings:
* Click on the volume control(speaker icon).
* Click the "Volume Control" button in the menu that pops up.
* Make sure that both "PCM" and "Front" are set to maximum.
* Click "Close"
=== Add CPU frequency monitor and control to the panel ===
This will show the CPU frequency and allow you to easily change its mode.
* Right click on the panel and select "add to panel"
* Select "CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor" and click add.
Now you can see the processor speed and control it.  Either by left clicking the icon and setting the speed, or by selecting a mode.
