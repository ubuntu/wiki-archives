'''Warning:''' This is an old article and may not work. Refer to <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/user-autologin.html|Ubuntu Help]]</nowiki> for latest approaches.

One of the reasons that Ubuntu are considered so secure is because they require passwords to install software or to configure the system. They also require passwords to login to the computer. If you want to bypass the login password, there is an Auto Login function you can set and use. There are different login windows in Ubuntu and each one of them requires a different procedure to auto login.

== Enabling automatic Login after suspend ==

 1. Type gconf-editor in a terminal (Alt+Ctrl+T to call the terminal).

 1. Go to apps/gnome-power-manager/locks

 1. Check "use_screensaver_settings".

 1. If still asked for password, you can (also in gconf-editor) go to desktop/gnome/lockdown and check: "disable_lock_screen"

== Enabling AutoLogin from command line ==

In Ubuntu 14.04: <pre>
sudo mkdir /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d
sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-myconfig.conf
</pre>
<pre>
[SeatDefaults]
autologin-user=USERNAME
</pre>
