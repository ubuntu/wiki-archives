__TOC__

== Introduction ==
ALPS touchpad is a pointing device found on some Dell and Acer notebooks similar to SynapticsTouchpad.

== Control touchpad features using synclient ==
ALPS touchpad configuration could be made through synaptics driver utility `synclient` found in the `gsynaptics` package.

For example, if you're having troubles with tap pressure sensitivity being too low, you can use the following command to adjust your touchpad settings:

<pre>
synclient FingerLow=2 FingerHigh=8
</pre>
