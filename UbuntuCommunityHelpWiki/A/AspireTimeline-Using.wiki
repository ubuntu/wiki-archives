Feel free to add your tweaks here:-)

== Power Consumption ==

Use powertop (sudo apt-get install powertop) to find out ways to reduce powerconsumption

* Wifi powersaving is important (2W), enable with "sudo iwconfig wlan0 power on"

One way of reducing powersaving is to add entries to /etc/rc.local so they get loaded at boot.

Sample /etc/rc.local for Timeline Laptops
<pre>

/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power on

exit 0
</pre>

Using powertop to measure power consumption (only available when running on battery), for the 3810t, 8-9W should be achievable with wifi on and LCD at medium brightness. That yields more than 7 hours of battery life. 
4810tz bios 1.28 Ubuntu 9.10 beta 45% brightness wifi on ~9.2w 

If the above command gives you the following output:
<pre>
Error for wireless request "Set Power Management" (8B2C) :
    SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not supported.
</pre>
It's likely that you're using a version of the driver that disabled that setting.
To upgrade to a new one, if you're on Karmic, try running:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-karmic-generic
</pre>
