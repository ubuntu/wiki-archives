__TOC__

This mouse works in a special way - is configurable (macros stored in a 16kb memory inside the mouse), and each key (around 11 at all) can act as keyboard key or mouse key.

Until now, the manufacturer only supports ms-windows. Great would be if someone could share information about how can we configure this mouse from Ubuntu, without needing ms-windows or Wine (anyway, the configuration tool provided with the mouse shows a kind of dll error when running on Wine). This configuration information is sent somehow via usb connection, the same connects the mouse to the computer.

Any help is very welcome.
