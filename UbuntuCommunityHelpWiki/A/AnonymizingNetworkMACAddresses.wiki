== Randomized Network MAC Address ==

You leak information about yourself everytime you associate to a network. Your computers network hardware contains an encoded, unique and serialized hexadecimal address. The MAC address is used by routers and switches on networks to direct traffic to and from your laptop.

Randomizing the MAC address your network hardware reports affords some level of anonymity and privacy.

'''CAUTION!:''' While MAC address randomization may afford some degree of anonymity and privacy, your network traffic activity may identify you. Additionally, if you fully randomize your MAC address, you may report such bizzare hardware vendor ids as to be quite conspicuous.

Commands in this guide assume you have sudo'ed root. i.e., '' sudo -i'' after each terminal login.

== Install NetworkManager ==

You likely have it installed already and can skip this step. To check `ls /etc/NetworkManager` which should return at least `dispatcher.d`. If you don't have it installed already, load it. 

<pre>
apt-get install network-manager
</pre>

== Install MACCHANGER ==

The package `macchanger` is in the `Networking (universe)`. Install it.

<pre>
apt-get install macchanger
</pre>

== Create the Randomizer Trigger ==
'''Note:''' Does not work in Jaunty (9.04)

Utilizing Network-Manager's methods to trigger events when a network interface changes state, place the `macchanger` script into `/etc/network/if-pre-up.d`.

<pre>
vi /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/macchanger
</pre>

Don't change ''$IFACE''. It is a reference provided by Network``Manager for the particular activated interface.

<pre>

/usr/bin/macchanger -e "$IFACE"
</pre>

Make it executable.

<pre>
chmod +x /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/macchanger
</pre>

== Interface State Change ==

Now everytime ''any'' managed interface is activated, as it passes through the ''pre-up'' phase, the network MAC address will be randomized under the ''VENDOR'' id.

== Fully Random ==

If you desire a completely random MAC address change the `-e` in the `macchanger` script to `-r`. There are additional switches you may consider. `man macchanger`.

== Anonymity, Privacy, Detection ==

'''CAUTION!:''' While MAC address randomization may afford some degree of anonymity and privacy, your network traffic activity may identify you. Additionally, if you fully randomize your MAC address, you may report such bizzare hardware vendor ids as to be quite conspicuous.

== DHCP and Other Considerations ==

'''WARNING!:''' DHCP reservations generally rely on a MAC address to reserve a particular IP address assignment. If you randomize your MAC address you will break your reservation.

'''WARNING!:''' Any networking application or device which relies on your unique MAC address will break since randomizing it will return a different value every time the interface is activate.

=== Special Mix Cases with Roaming Profiles ===

For the times when you trust your network and need to report the actual/physical network MAC address you have the option of using RoamingProfilesWithNetworkManager. You would relocate the `macchanger` script to the `if-pre-up.d` for the given profiles. So, when on the home network you could modify the `macchanger` script to use `-m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` to force the actual/constant MAC address. And, when on any other network run `macchanger` in random mode.

With roaming profiles you could still accomodate DHCP reservations or special application/hardware requirements.
