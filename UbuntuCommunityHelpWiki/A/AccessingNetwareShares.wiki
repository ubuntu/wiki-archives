== Introduction ==

This page shows how to mount a Netware filesystem and create symbolic links to it on the User Desktop.

== What is Needed ==

ncpfs - a set of utilities to use resources from !NetWare servers.

ipx (utilities to configure the kernel ipx interface) might also be needed.

== Mount Netware Filesystem ==

Firstly we need to make the folder to mount the filesystem to.

   {{{
sudo mkdir /mnt/company_fs
sudo chown -R <UbuntuUserName>:<UbuntuGroupName> /mnt/company_fs}}}

Then we mount the filesystem (run as the Ubuntu user you want to have access, not root):
   
   {{{
ncpmount -A <NetwareServerDNSName> -S <NetwareServerName> -U <NetwareUserName> -P <NetwarePassword> /mnt/company_fs}}}

To make sure that the filesystem is automatically mounted at startup, we need to add the following line to /etc/rc.local

   {{{
ncpmount -A <NetwareServerDNSName> -S <NetwareServerName> -U <NetwareUserName> -P <NetwarePassword> -u <UbuntuUserID> -g <UbuntuGroupID> -c <UbuntuUserName> /mnt/company_fs}}}

== Creating Symbolic Links ==
Create a symbolic (never a hard) link to the mounted netware filesystem and place it in a folder on the user desktop.

   {{{
ln -s /mnt/company_fs /home/<UbuntuUserName>/Desktop/CompanyNetwork/company_fs}}}

Now, most Companies have a lot of shared drives in Windows, ex P: S: X: etc., that are normally used for say Apps, Users etc.

If required these shares must be made with symbolic links as only one mount to a filesystem can be make at a time.
   {{{
ln -s /mnt/company_fs/FolderToShare /home/<UbuntuUserName>/Desktop/CompanyNetwork/ShareDriveName}}}

== Netware Password Change ==

Most Windows Netware Clients needs to change their passwords every x days.

So to make it easy to update your passwords in Ubuntu use this script after changing your Windows Netware Password.

   {{{

ncpumount -a

gedit /etc/cups/printers.conf
echo
echo 'Restarting the CUPS service...'
echo
/etc/init.d/cupsys restart

gedit /etc/rc.d/rc.local
echo
echo 'Running rc.local script to configure IPX Netware mounts...'
echo
/etc/rc.d/rc.local
   }}}
