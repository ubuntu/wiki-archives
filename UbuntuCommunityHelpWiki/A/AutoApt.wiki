__TOC__


== What is auto-apt for? ==
When you want to build a program from source and it fails due to missing headers. Auto-apt can search what package would provide the header files.

== Install ==
<pre>
sudo apt-get install auto-apt
sudo auto-apt update
sudo auto-apt updatedb && sudo auto-apt update-local
</pre>

== Usage ==
Search for a header file:
<pre>
auto-apt search [headerfile.h]
</pre>

Example:
<pre>
auto-apt search Xlib.h
</pre>

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/tip.png]]</nowiki> You can use it combined with CheckInstall, or you could try using Ubuntu:AutoDeb, which combines the two as well as providing some additional facilities.

== Commands ==
run - Enter auto-apt environment
    run [command [cmdarg]]
update - Retrieve new lists of Contents (available file list)
    update
updatedb - Regenerate lists of Contents (available file list, no download)
    updatedb

For some commands, command name with -local suffix, it will use pkgfiles.db, which is created by update-local command, instead of pkgcontents.db
