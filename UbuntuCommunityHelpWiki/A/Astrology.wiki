== Introduction ==

Ubuntu users seeking Astrology software for Linux often end up using Windows application through <nowiki>[[Wine]]</nowiki>. Whilst many such applications work well in Wine there are also native astrology programs available in the Ubuntu repository. A brief overview of the native astrology application follows.

=== Native Linux apps ===
==== Astrolog ====
You can install native Astrolog version (5.40) from Ubuntu repository.
Type in a terminal:<pre>
sudo apt-get install astrolog
</pre>
The program has many functions, but the main disadvantage is its spartan interface. 
To launch program, type `astrolog`. In the foloowing, you will type things like day, month, year, time zone, latitude and longitude etc. The output will be text-only. If you want graphic chart, type `astrolog -X` instead.
There are many more switches (like -X) and options (configuration file- `astrolog.dat` should be modified). Configuration file can by copied i.e. from <nowiki>[[http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog.htm|Windows version]]</nowiki>  and you can adapt it to suit your needs. Refer to astrolog help file or official documentation.

==== OpenAstro.org ====
Openastro.org is an open source fully featured astrology software developed on Ubuntu.
You can download ready made binaries or add the repository from <nowiki>[[http://www.openastro.org|www.openastro.org]]</nowiki>. ''Below is a screenshot of the main interface''.

==== Mindmeld ====
Mindmeld is an open-source Python based astrology library that allows simple calculation of Grant Lewi numbers, Jan Spiller, Chinese astrology lookups, as well as numerology based on Dan Millman's book on the subject. An interesting subproject tries to correlate Myers-Briggs type results with astrology information using known celebrities and some data mining. Explanation for all type results are under development tree. Mindmeld aims to be a drop-in library for any astrological information and tool development.

==== Other linux programs ====

==== Maitreya ====

'''Maitreya''' is oriented mainly at vedic (indian) astrology, but also basic western chart techniques are supported.
Home page: http://saravali.de/maitreya/index.html
http://sourceforge.net/projects/maitreya/
Application is not in repository, also no binaries are (yet) available, so compilation from source code will be necessary.

Update: Binaries are now available. A detailed step by step installation guide can be found at http://makegadgetswork.blogspot.com/2010/03/install-maitreya-vedic-astrology_22.html
==== Skylendar ====

'''Skylendar''' is succesor of '''Kastrolog''', these also Astrolog derivatives. KAstrolog cannot probably be installed because its dependencies on old QT libraries (?), while Skylendar is newer, unformately there are no binaries or packages, again compilation is necessary. This is only for experienced users (compilation). Author has on its pages special Ubuntu binary (skylendar.bz.2), but this one file is not enough for program to run. So, if you are not experienced Linux administrator or have not such acquaintance, I would not recommend to fiddle with this. Better try Astrolog32, which has also more functions.

=== Software that will run with Wine ===
It is necessary to have Wine installed so first of all, 

Read  <nowiki>[[Wine]]</nowiki>.

==== Astrolog32 ====
<nowiki>[[File:astrolog1-icon.png]]</nowiki> '''Astrolog32''' is based on <nowiki>[[http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog.htm|original Walter Pullen version]]</nowiki> and ads some enhancements like advanced search funcion (see screenshot), long filename support, built-in precise Swiss Ephemeris etc.

Older 1x version: http://uk.geocities.com/astrolog32/

===== Tips, trics =====
* if program cannot find its configuration file (astrolog32.dat)-i.e. you save your configuration with option '''File''' → '''Save current settings''', close program and run it again and well, program runs with old setting . If this is your case, try to copy file  ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ files/Astrolog32/main/'''astrolog32.dat''' directly to your home folder, i.e /home/frank. (`cp ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ files/Astrolog32/main/astrolog32.dat ~/frank`)

==== Zet 8 lite ====
<nowiki>[[File:zet8-icon.png]]</nowiki> '''Zet 8''' is another excellent sofware. You can also buy "Professional" version with more funkctions. "Lite" version is freeware.
