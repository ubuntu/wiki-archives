__TOC__

=== Apache Pre-reqs ===
Install "libapache-mod-auth-kerb" - of course you'll also need apache setup and this article assumes you've already got kerberos setup as it's discussed <nowiki>[[ADAuthentication|here]]</nowiki>. One example of how you can take advantage of Kerbose & Apache in a case like this is to enable authentication with your <nowiki>[[ADAuthentication|Active Directory]]</nowiki> server.
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libapache-mod-auth-kerb
</pre>

=== /etc/krb5.keytab ===
You need to setup a kerberos keytab, put it where ever, I put mine at ''/etc/krb5.keytab''.

This file should contain a line of the form ''HTTP/replace_your_web_server_full_hostname_here@ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_FULL_DOMAIN_NAME''.

So, to put that another way: ''HTTP/www.mydomain.com@MYDOMAIN.COM''

=== Edit VirtualHosts ===
In whatever sections of your Apache <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_host | VirtualHosts]]</nowiki> (or just apache config if you're running only one site), you want to add lines of the following form:

<pre>
AuthName "Kerberos Login"
AuthType Kerberos
Krb5Keytab /etc/krb5.keytab
KrbAuthRealm EXAMPLE.COM
KrbMethodNegotiate off
KrbSaveCredentials off
KrbVerifyKDC off
Require valid-user
</pre>

=== Restart Apache ===
Almost done:
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart
</pre>
