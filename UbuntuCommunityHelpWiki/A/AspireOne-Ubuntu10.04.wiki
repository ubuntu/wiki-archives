__TOC__

The default temps are a bit high, so if you notice your device getting too hot, you can adjust the temp that the fan turns on and off by adding a few parameters to the options line above. The following seems to prevent it from running too hot: 'options acerhdf kernelmode=1 fanon=61000 fanoff=54000' See http://piie.net/files/acerhdf_README.txt  for more info.

(N.B.- http://piie.net/files/acerhdf_README.txt has not yet been updated to reflect that ubuntu now expects the temperatures to be specified as '61000' rather than the former '61'.) 

Both Card readers work after bios update to version 3309, which makes the leftcard reader recognise cards even if empty at boot time, however the righthand card reader still requires some work if you edit /etc/default/grub as detailed below GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="pciehp.pciehp_force=1 elavator=noop quiet splash" 

Power manager status icon in the Notification Applet does not switch from AC power to Battery when unplugged, although the screen dims.

Suspend mode will hang if a MM/SD/SDHC card is mounted, if you don't like the excellent script below then you can unmount it from the Nautilus file manger, or physically pop it out, if you're 100% sure it's not is use.
