=== Overview ===
Ajaxterm is a web based terminal. It was totally inspired and works almost exactly like <nowiki>[[http://anyterm.org|Anyterm]]</nowiki> except it's much easier to install.

* Ajaxterm written in python (and some AJAX javascript for client side) and depends only on python2.3 or better. 
* Ajaxterm is very simple to install on Linux, MacOS X, FreeBSD, Solaris, cygwin and any Unix that runs python2.3. 
* Ajaxterm was written by Antony Lesuisse (email: al AT udev.org), License Public Domain.

=== Installation and Setup ===
Simply install the ajaxterm package.
<pre>
sudo apt-get install ajaxterm
</pre>

You will need to enable SSH password authentication for AjaxTerm to work.
<pre> 
sudo sed -i s:PasswordAuthentication.*:PasswordAuthentication yes: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo service ssh restart
</pre>

The default location for the config file is located /etc/default/ajaxterm . This may be edited to change the default port [Default=8022]

Remember to open up port 8022 if you are running a firewall, and that is it set up on your local machine. You can access it with <nowiki>[[http://localhost:8022/]]</nowiki> . How ever check out below for how to access it from an external machine.

=== External Access ===
You can access your computer externally, how ever this is unsafe and may compromise your computers safety. Below is a fairly safe way of using Apache2 and SSL. 

To configure Apache2 for HTTPS and generate a certificate, follow the instructions in the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/httpd.html|Server Guide]]</nowiki>.

Now copy [then symlink] the SSL config from the Available sites to the Enabled sites
<pre>
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/default /etc/apache2/sites-available/ssl
</pre>

Make sure all the modules and sites for proxy and ssl have been enabled.
<pre>
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2ensite default-ssl
</pre>

It is time to decide on an htaccess password and username. Remember to make this password strong.
<pre> 
sudo mkdir /srv/ajaxterm
sudo htpasswd -bc /srv/ajaxterm/.htpasswd [user] [pass]
</pre>

You will now need to edit the default Apache SSL configuration.
<pre>
sudo nano -w /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl
</pre>

Insert just before <code></VirtualHost></code>:

<pre>
        ProxyRequests Off
        <Proxy *>
                AuthUserFile /srv/ajaxterm/.htpasswd
                AuthName EnterPassword
                AuthType Basic
                require valid-user

                Order Deny,allow
                Allow from all
        </Proxy>
        ProxyPass / http://localhost:8022/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8022/
</pre>

Restart apache2.
<pre>
sudo service apache2 restart
</pre>

Open your firewall port 443 and try to browse to <nowiki>[[https://yourhost.foo]]</nowiki> where yourhost.foo is either your IP adress or your hostname/web address.
