== Introduction to Apport Retracing Service ==

<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~apport|Apport Retracing Service]]</nowiki> (ARS) is a <nowiki>[[Launchpad]]</nowiki> bot which automatically provides symbolic stack traces to Launchpad crash reports.

When a Ubuntu Community member submits a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CrashReporting|crash report]]</nowiki> to Launchpad, a variety of files are attached, one of which is the CoreDump.gz file. Typically, after ARS processes this file, it removes it, and then the report <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Status|Status]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Importance|Importance]]</nowiki> is changed, dependent on the outcome of how ARS processed the file.

=== outdated debug symbol package ===

Thank you for your report!

However, processing it in order to get sufficient information for the
developers failed (it does not generate a useful symbolic stack trace). This
might be caused by some outdated packages which were installed on your system
at the time of the report:

outdated debug symbol package for libfribidi0: package version 0.19.2-3 dbgsym version 0.19.2-1

Please upgrade your system to the latest package versions. If you still
encounter the crash, please file a new report.

Thank you for your understanding, and sorry for the inconvenience!
</pre>

The package version the user has installed, 0.19.2-3, is newer than the one ARS has (0.19.2-1). This message could mean that the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fribidi|libfribidi0]]</nowiki> package version 0.19.2-3 is unable to be processed by ARS because it cannot find the debug symbols for 0.19.2-3, it only has 0.19.2-1.
In this case, this would not be something you did wrong or did not install, but a current limitation in ARS.

=== no debug symbol package found ===

ARS doesn't have a debug symbol for this package. In this case, this would not be something you did wrong or did not install, but a current limitation in ARS.

might be caused by some outdated packages which were installed on your system
at the time of the report:

libreoffice-core version 1:3.6.1~rc2-1ubuntu5 required, but 1:3.6.2~rc2-0ubuntu1 is available

Please upgrade your system to the latest package versions. If you still
encounter the crash, please file a new report.

Thank you for your understanding, and sorry for the inconvenience!

Here the user has libreoffice-core version 1:3.6.1~rc2-1ubuntu5 installed, but 1:3.6.2~rc2-0ubuntu1 is available from the -Proposed repository. In this case, one would want to enable the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed|-Proposed]]</nowiki> repository, and if reproducible, file another crash report.
