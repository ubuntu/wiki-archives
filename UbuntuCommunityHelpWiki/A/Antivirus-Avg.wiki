__TOC__

AVG Free is a version of the AVG anti-virus software which is free for private and non-commercial use. 

There is also <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Anti-Virus|other anti-virus software for Ubuntu]]</nowiki>.

There is no offical graphical interface available for the current Linux versions of AVG, but there is a free, third-party one called <nowiki>[[http://www.avg.com/ww-en/avg-forums?sec=thread&act=show&id=234645&type=0|AVG-GUI]]</nowiki>.

=== Install AVG Free ===

 Note: If you are using a 64-bit version of Ubuntu, you may need to install 32-bit compatibility packages.  See <nowiki>[[MultiArch]]</nowiki>.

Download the deb package from <nowiki>[[http://free.avg.com/us-en/download-free-all-product]]</nowiki> and install it.

=== Run daemons at boot or on-demand ===
By default, the AVG package sets up several daemons to start when the system is booted.  If you only run scans occasionally, you may not want to run the daemons all the time.  In this case, you can disable the daemons' automatic starting by running:

<code>sudo update-rc.d avgd disable</code>

Then, when you want to run a scan, start the daemons by running:

<code>sudo /etc/init.d/avgd start</code>

You can stop the daemons afterwards by running:

<code>sudo /etc/init.d/avgd stop</code>

If you decide later that you want to run the daemons at boot again, simply reinstall the package.

=== Update virus definitions ===
After installing the package, you should update the virus definitions by running:

<code>sudo avgupdate</code>

=== Scan files and directories ===

You can scan files and directories on-demand by running <code>avgscan</code>.  Refer to the <code>avgscan</code> man page for details.  A thorough, "paranoid" scan, storing the report in a file, might look like:

<code>avgscan -aPcijk -r /tmp/avgscan.log /path1 /path2</code>
