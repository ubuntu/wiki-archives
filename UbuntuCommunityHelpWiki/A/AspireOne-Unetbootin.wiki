=== Use Unetbootin ===

On this website: <nowiki>[[http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2008/08/27/create-a-bootable-usb-drive-or-memory-card/|Create a bootable USB Drive or Memory Card]]</nowiki>, the tool used was <nowiki>[[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/|UNetbootin]]</nowiki> which seems to only require the one computer to run it on (as a statically linked binary, no install required, minimal dependencies) and generically works for a large number of distributions in addition to ubuntu and handles custom diskimages and custom kernels. This seems like a tool that is a little more quick than UbuntuLiveUSB.

To install:
* download .bin file from sourceforge
* right click on file, check executable (or run chmod +x *.bin in terminal)
* sudo apt-get install mtools p7zip-full
* run file (double click or type ./unetbooin-linux-282 in terminal) on any linux system
* select diskimage or distribution
* select USB drive from list (uses only device names unfortunately)
* click ok

Note: UNetbootin is now available in the repositories and can be installed using a package manager. 

Flash drive or memory card will be formatted and set up as a bootable drive.
