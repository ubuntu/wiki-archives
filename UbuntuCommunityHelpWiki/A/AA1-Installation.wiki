__TOC__



This page contains initial installation suggestions.

== Prepare Media ==
To install Ubuntu on the AA1, you'll need to use either an external optical drive (connected via USB), or create USB storage install media.

* Refer to <nowiki>[[Installation-FromUSBStick]]</nowiki> for directions on creating USB installation media.
* You may also plug in an external optical drive and use an Ubuntu LiveCD/LiveDVD.

== Installation ==
Turn on the machine, and press <F12>.

Select the correct boot device and press <Enter>.

In the <F12> menu:
* USB-HDD refers to a USB storage device.
** Sometimes these will be referred to as USB-FDD, depending on the stick and the specific model of Aspire One. This will not affect the installation, though it is a bug that Acer should fix.
* USB-CDROM refers to an attached external optical drive.

=== Disk ===
* If you have the hard disk version of the AA1, install like normal.
* If you have the solid state drive (SSD) version, it is suggested that you choose to use a non-journalling filesystem like ext2 to prolong the life of the drive.
