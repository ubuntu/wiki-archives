__TOC__



Ubuntu can control an OS X machine remotely, using the default Remmina Remote Desktop Client application.

== Setting up the Mac to be Accessed Remotely ==

On the Mac:
* Open System Preferences (it's in the Apple menu)
* Open the '''Sharing''' panel
* Check the box '''Apple Remote Desktop'''
* Click '''Access Privileges'''
* Check the box '''VNC viewers may control screen with password''', and enter a password
* Click '''OK'''

== Accessing the Mac From Ubuntu ==

On Ubuntu:
* Launch '''Remmina Remote Desktop Client'''
* Select '''Connection > New''' from menu
* Select '''VNC - Virtual Network Computing''' as '''Protocol'''
* Fill '''Server''' field with either IP address or hostname of the Mac
* Optionally fill both '''User name''' and '''Password''' to make Remmina remember Your credentials
* '''IMPORTANT:''' Set '''Color depth''' to '''High color (15 bit)''' or better, otherwise connection will fail
* Click '''Connect''' (or '''Save''' to reuse it later)

Your Mac's desktop should appear on your screen.

== Other working clients ==
 . '''xtightvncviewer''': asks two times for authentization – first time in local terminal, the second one is on remote OS X login screen; some special applications (e.g. VirtualBox) running on the remote host can capture keyboard and thus make entering the credetials impossible.
 . '''gnome-rdp''': with xtightvncviewer installed and set as default vncviewer (run <code>sudo update-alternatives --set vncviewer /usr/bin/xtightvncviewer</code> in terminal)
 . '''xvnc4viewer''': only with -FullColour, but very slow: <code>xvnc4viewer -FullColour macserver</code>

To work around authentication issues like "Unknown authentication scheme" or such, it may help to enter this in Terminal (or over SSH):

<code>sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -verbose -activate -restart -agent -allowAccessFor -allUsers -privs -all -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes -setvncpw -vncpw passwordYouWantToUse</code>
