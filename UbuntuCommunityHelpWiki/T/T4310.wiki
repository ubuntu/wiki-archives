=== How to make things working ===
==== Touchscreen ====
wacom input does not rotate with screen !
First, setserial has to be installed using
<code>sudo apt-get install setserial</code>.
Then /var/lib/setserial/autoserial.conf has to be modified to include following line:
<code>/dev/ttyS0 port 0x220 irq 4 autoconfig</code> and 
/etc/X11/xorg.conf has to be created, file which works for me (but only using stylus, no fingers, multitouch or even good rotation !!) follows:
