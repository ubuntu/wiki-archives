__TOC__

<nowiki>[[http://trac.edgewall.org/|Trac]]</nowiki> is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development projects. 

Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project management. Our mission is to help developers write great software while staying out of the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a team's established development process and policies.

=== Choose your preferred installation method ===

There are several ways to have Trac up and running:
* Manual installation with PIP on top of Apache2 and mod_wsgi: <nowiki>[[TracApacheModWsgi]]</nowiki> (''recommended method'')
* Manual installation on top of Apache2 with mod_python: <nowiki>[[TracApacheModPython]]</nowiki>
* Some users may prefer to skip manual installation by using the unofficial pre-integrated <nowiki>[[http://www.turnkeylinux.org/trac|TurnKey Trac Appliance]]</nowiki> based on Ubuntu LTS
* This is an old how-to for manual installation on top of Apache2, mod_python, Subversion, HTTP/DAV authentication and an SQLite database: <nowiki>[[UbuntuTracHowto]]</nowiki>
