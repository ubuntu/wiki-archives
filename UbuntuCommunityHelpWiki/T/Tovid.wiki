== Introduction ==
Tovid is a collection of video disc authoring tools.  With Tovid, you can create DVDs and other video discs.

== Installing Tovid ==
For users of Ubuntu prior to Hardy Heron (8.04), please see <nowiki>[[http://tovid.wikia.com/wiki/Installing_tovid|this page]]</nowiki> for instructions on installing Tovid from source.  Before beginning, open Synaptic Package Manager (System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager) and search for ''build-essential''.  If the box is not already green, click it and choose `Mark for Installation`.  When you are asked to mark additional packages, click the Mark button.  Click Apply and basic development tools will be installed.  After this is complete, continue with the Tovid directions for installing from source.

For users of Hardy Heron (8.04) and later, tovid is in the Ubuntu repositories.  If you haven't already enabled the Multiverse repository, enable extra repositories as shown <nowiki>[[http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/sources#simple|here]]</nowiki>.

Open Synaptic Package Manager (System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager) and search for ''tovid''.  You should now see at least two packages, including `tovid` and `tovidgui`.  For both of these packages, click the white box beside the name and choose `Mark for Installation`.  If you are asked to mark additional packages, click the Mark button.  Click Apply and wait for Tovid to be installed. 

== Using Tovid ==
There are two ways to use Tovid - through its command-line interface, or through its graphical user interface (GUI).

=== Using the Tovid GUI ===
There are three graphical interfaces to Tovid.

==== Tovid GUI ====
Tovid GUI was installed previously.  It is available through the menu by going to Applications -> Sount & Video -> tovid GUI.

==== Todisc GUI ====
If you prefer to use the Todisc GUI, go back to Synaptic Package Manager and install the `todiscgui` package.  It will be available from the menu by going to Applications -> Sound & Video -> todisc GUI.

==== Tovidwiz ====
Tovidwiz, created by binks on the Ubuntu Forums, is available in <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=20993&d=1166039241|this package]]</nowiki>.  See <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=311936|this forum thread]]</nowiki> for more information on using Tovidwiz.

=== Using the Tovid Command Line ===
There are two options for using the Tovid command line: the `tovid` script, or the `todisc` script.  You will need to open a Terminal (Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal) for this section.

==== Tovid Script ====
The full list of options for tovid with descriptions can be shown with the command <code>man tovid</code>.  An example command is shown here, with options explained:

<pre>
tovid -wide -pal -in foo.avi -out foo_encoded
</pre>
* `-wide`: The encoded file will be in widescreen format (16:9 aspect ratio)
* `-pal`: Use PAL video format, used basically everywhere except North America and Japan
* `-in foo.avi`: Use a file called `foo.avi` as the video file to convert.  Change `foo.avi` to the name of the file you want to use.
* `-out foo_encoded`: Set the output file to `foo_encoded`, plus the appropriate file extension.  In this case, the resulting file will be named `foo_encoded.mpg`.  Change `foo_encoded` to be the file name you would like the resulting file to have, minus the file extension.

==== Todisc Script ====
The full list of options for todisc with descriptions can be shown with the command <code>man todisc</code>.  An example command is shown here, with options explained:

<pre>
todisc -files File1.mpg File2.mpg File3.mpg -titles "Episode 1" "Episode 2" "Episode 3" -out Season_one
</pre>
* `-files File1.mpg File2.mpg File3.mpg`: Use the list of files as the input files to the resulting DVD disc image
* `-titles "Episode 1" "Episode 2" "Episode 3"`: Use the list of titles as the titles for the corresponding file (the first title is assigned to the first file, and so on).  There must be an equal number of entries for the `-files` and `-title` options.
* `-out Season_one`: Set the output file to `Season_one`, plus the appropriate file extension.

==== Creating a Video Disc ====
After Tovid has finished creating your video disc, it needs to be properly turned into a DVD image for burning.  Type these commands into your Terminal window, pushing Enter after each line:

<pre>
makexml -menu Menu.mpg foo1.mpg foo2.mpg foo3.mpg -out MyDisc
makedvd -burn MyDisc.xml
</pre>

This will give you a DVD which can be played on your computer and on most DVD players.  Note that this is unique to the command-line interface.

If you want to make more DVDs, you need to delete the `dvd` folder that was created and either move completed files to a different directory or simply delete them.
