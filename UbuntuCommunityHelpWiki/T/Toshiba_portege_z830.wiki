== Toshiba Portege Z830/Z835 ==

Works mostly well with Ubuntu 11.10 out-of the box:
the screen brightness buttons do not work after returning from a suspend, and default battery life is not great, but both these problems are solvable: see <nowiki>[[http://www.linlap.com/wiki/toshiba+portege+z830-10f|this page]]</nowiki>.

Bluetooth works, but you may have to press FN+F8 until bluetooth is switched on (it cycles between wifi, bluetooth, wifi+bluetooth, off). Some models don't include bluetooth.
