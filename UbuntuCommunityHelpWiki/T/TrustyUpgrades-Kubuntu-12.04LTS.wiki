'''Some Issues:''' 

* If Muon Update Manager still doesn't detects the latest version, close it and run the following command in Konsole: ''sudo update-manager -d'' which run the Update Manager and it will find the latest Kubuntu version.

* If a version Muon Update Manager finds is Kubuntu Quantal (12.10) and not the new 14.04 LTS, then your Ubuntu is still set to receive regular (not LTS) upgrades. There must be a way to change that setting in Muon (perhaps in Muon (not Muon Update Manager) settings, Software sources dialog, tab Updates), but I cannot check for it at the moment. An easy but more technical way would be to edit a settings file /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades directly. E.g., run 

<code>kdesudo kate /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades</code>

and change line under DEFAULT settings from 

<code>Prompt=normal</code>

to 

<code>Prompt=lts</code>

Save and close the file. Then restart Muon Update Manager.
