!HowTo share Thunerbird across platforms, perhaps including Windows & Ubuntu see the last comment made by me, Tom, in
* http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/thunderbird-data-howto-switch-profiles-to-a-backup-846852/
the rest of the thread is helpful if you have lost data/emails and want to try to do some data-recovery or hack the system.  This next link, 1st comment, is where the advice about sharing the profile through the gui-way 'first' appeared

The problem i had with sharing Thunderbird across Windows & Ubuntu was that i had not set the Windows drive to automount in the fstab and was very wary about doing so.  Part of the reason for dual-booting on that machine was that WHEN Windows goes wrong there is still a usable Operating System.  However this problem with not really sharing too easily meant the machine's user is now FORCED to use ubuntu for almost everything as Windows is increasingly far behind in many areas as it requires expensive or pirated software that is increasingly difficult to find for existing systems the machine uses :)
