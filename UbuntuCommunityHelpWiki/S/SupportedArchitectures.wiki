__TOC__


Ubuntu is currently officially compatible with five processor architectures - x86_64 (aka AMD64), ARM64 (aka AArch64), PowerPC64 (aka POWER), System z (aka S390X), and RISC-V. Previously supported architectures include x86, PowerPC, and SPARC64.

== x86_64 ==

This covers AMD processors with the "amd64" extension and Intel processors with the "em64t" extension. Most consumer desktops, laptops, and servers from 2006 onwards use this architecture. Examples of processors that use this architecture are:

* AMD Athlon 64
* AMD Athlon II
* AMD Ryzen
* AMD Opteron
* Intel Pentium D
* Intel Core 2
* Intel Core i3/i5/i7/i9
* Intel Core Ultra 

== ARM ==
64 bit ARM !SoCs (System on Chip) from multiple SoC vendors have been enabled and certified on Ubuntu 14.04 and newer releases. Please refer to https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/arm  for download and installation instructions.  A list of Ubuntu-certified ARM !SoCs and Servers can be found on Ubuntu the SoC Certification (see https://certification.ubuntu.com/soc/) and Ubuntu Server Certification pages (see https://certification.ubuntu.com/server/). 

== POWER (OpenPOWER) Servers ==

As of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, IBM's POWER8 (ppc64el) architecture and its OpenPOWER variants are fully supported. Please refer to http://wiki.ubuntu.com/ppc64el for details.

== S390X (IBM Mainframe Systems) ==

As of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, certain systems that utilize IBM's S390X architecture, also referred to as  "System z" and "LinuxONE" are fully supported. Currently, these are: IBM z13, IBM z13s, IBM zEC12, IBM zBC12, LinuxONE Emperor and LinuxONE Rockhopper. Please refer to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/S390X for details.

== x86 (legacy) ==

Note: support for this architecture was dropped after 19.10. 18.04 was the last version for which ISO images were produced.

This covers the vast majority of desktop and laptop PCs and small-to-medium servers from the early 90s to 2006, and netbooks as late as 2009. Computers with an <nowiki>[[#AMD64 (x86_64)|x86_64]]</nowiki> architecture could also run this version.

Examples of processors that used this architecture (but are not compatible with the x86_64 architecture) are:

* AMD K6-2
* Intel Pentium
* Intel Pentium Pro
* Intel Pentium II
* AMD Athlon
* AMD Athlon XP
* Intel Pentium III
* Intel Pentium 4 (some later models are x86_64)
* Intel Celeron D
* Intel Core Duo
* Via C7

== PowerPC (legacy) ==

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/note.png]]</nowiki> ''Please note, that PowerPC Long Term Support ended with Ubuntu 6.06.  Updates were still available from <nowiki>[[http://ports.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu Ports]]</nowiki> until Ubuntu 16.04.''

This covers the majority of machines with a PowerPC CPU.

Most prominent are the Power Macintoshes produced by Apple. Note that older Macs with a Motorola 680x0 processor are *not* covered here. (They have the "m68k" architecture, which isn't supported by Ubuntu but may be supported by other Linux distributions.)

The PowerPC family is quite varied though, you can find everything from Power Macintosh clones to IBM small-to-medium servers here.

This architecture also covers most bus systems that are in use with the PowerPC processor. The most notable exception is the Nu``Bus, which was used in some Apple Macintosh models (before Apple switched over to PCI). (A Linux kernel and limited support for the Nu``Bus can be found at <nowiki>[[http://nubus-pmac.sourceforge.net/]]</nowiki>).

This list is not exhaustive. New models are constantly being brought out, and some older models may be absent because they haven't been tested.

== SPARC64 (legacy) ==

SPARC64 processors were supported from <nowiki>[[http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/|6.06]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/|7.04]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/|7.10]]</nowiki> on the server edition only.  As of <nowiki>[[http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04|8.04]]</nowiki>, SPARC is no longer commercially supported.  It was maintained as an Ubuntu Port through 10.04.

== Multiprocessor Machines ==

All of the above architectures may come in a multiprocessor flavor (often called "symmetric multiprocessing" or SMP). This is not a problem for Ubuntu: it can handle multiple processors just fine.

The installation process may choose to use just one of the CPUs, but that's no cause for alarm: you'll be given the opportunity to adapt Ubuntu to your hardware later, from this page: <nowiki>[[CompileTheKernel]]</nowiki>.
