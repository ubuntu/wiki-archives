The default setup of Ubuntu does not make it easy to use static DNS servers while using DHCP. 
If you use the standard ubuntu way of networking (ifupdown), you can edit <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>

In that file you find the entry for your interface. If your interface is eth0, then look for the following lines:
<pre>
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp</pre>

Add one line, so it looks like:
<pre>
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
dns-nameservers ip.address.of.nameserver</pre>

Run
<pre>
sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart</pre>

To make the changes effective

If you do not use ifupdown, you need to edit <code>/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf</code>

Find the lines
<pre>
request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
        domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name,
        netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope;
</pre>

And change them to
<pre>
prepend domain-name-servers 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5;
request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
        domain-name, host-name,
        netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope;
</pre>

Replace 1.2.3.4 and 1.2.3.5 with the addresses of your DNS servers.

Run
<pre>
sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart</pre>
