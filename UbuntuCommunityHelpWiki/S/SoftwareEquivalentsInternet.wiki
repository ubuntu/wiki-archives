This section of SoftwareEquivalents holds equivalents to Internet software.

Please find your desired application, and use the Linux-equivalent instead!

One application may hold more equivalents. People are different, and therefore one application may not fully equal the parts you use in the "original" application.

== The applications ==

Feel free to add your own choices, but please keep the applications sorted alphabetically. (Also, please refrain from adding Windows programs running in WINE. Instead you can contribute to <nowiki>[[http://appdb.winehq.org/|the official list of programs which run in WINE]]</nowiki>)
