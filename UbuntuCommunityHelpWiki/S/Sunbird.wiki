== Mozilla Sunbird ==
Mozilla Sunbird is a cross-platform calendar application.

Mozilla calendar application is also available as an extension to <nowiki>[[Thunderbird|Mozilla Thunderbird]]</nowiki>.  You don't need to install Sunbird if you choose to install <nowiki>[[ThunderbirdLightning|the Lightning extension]]</nowiki>.

=== Installing ===

In Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) and later, Sunbird is available in the <nowiki>[[Universe]]</nowiki> repository. Simply install the "sunbird" package.

In Ubuntu 10.04.1 (Lucid first point release), the "sunbird" package has been removed from the repositories (because Mozilla has stated that Sunbird 1.0 is "the last public Sunbird release by the Calendar Project" and recommends "upgrading to Thunderbird 3 and Lightning 1.0").  There is a blog entry explaining <nowiki>[[http://brizoma.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/sunbird-and-lightning-removed-from-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx/|a solution to keep using your calendar data]]</nowiki>.
