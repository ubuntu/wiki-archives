__TOC__


'''Synaptic''' is a graphical front-end to <nowiki>[[http://www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals#apt-howto|apt]]</nowiki>, the package management system in Ubuntu. It combines the point-and-click simplicity of the graphical user interface with the power of the ''apt-get'' command line tool. You can install, remove, configure, or upgrade software packages, browse, sort and search the list of available software packages, manage repositories, or upgrade the whole system. You can queue up a number of actions before you execute them. Synaptic will inform you about dependencies (additional packages required by the software package you have chosen) as well as conflicts with other packages that are already installed on your system.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/info.png]]</nowiki> Synaptic's sibling on the Kubuntu desktop is Adept. If you prefer to use the command line instead of a graphical user interface, apt-get and aptitude are available. For information on these alternatives see InstallingSoftware.

== Note for 11.10 release and above ==

'''Synaptic''' is no longer installed by default in Ubuntu 11.10, however it is still useful in some situations.

=== Installing with software-center ===

You can install it by searching in the software-center for '''synaptic''' and clicking on ''Synaptic Package Manager''

=== Installing with CLI ===
Or, alternatively, open a terminal, and enter:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install synaptic
</pre>

== Getting Started ==

To launch Synaptic, choose 
 '''System''' > '''Administration''' > "'''Synaptic Package Manager'''"

Or if you are using the Unity interface, open the dash and search for '''synaptic'''.

The main window is divided into three sections: a package browser on the left, the package list on the upper right, and package details on the lower right. The status bar shows you the system state at a glance.

<nowiki>[[File:Synaptic-Package-Manager.png]]</nowiki>

And if you would like to see more details about a package, use a mouse right-click on a package and choose '''Properties'''

<nowiki>[[File:Screenshot-apt-Properties.png]]</nowiki>

== Browsing the package database ==

To browse the (very large) list of available packages by category, section, package status, custom filters, or recent searches. Click on the corresponding button at the bottom of the left window pane. You can also create your own filters. See the <nowiki>[[#filters|Filters]]</nowiki> section for details.

To search for packages by name or description, click on the '''Search''' button in the toolbar:

 <nowiki>[[File:synaptic-find.png]]</nowiki>

or use the "Quick search" field in the toolbar:

 <nowiki>[[File:synaptic-quicksearch.png]]</nowiki>

You can examine a number of package details in the lower right window pane such as its size, its dependencies, recommended or suggested additional packages, and a short description.

== How to apply filters ==

* To be added

== Repositories ==

Repositories are like shops (currently almost always free), warehouses or archives full of almost all the software, drivers, codecs, libraries and other packages that are available for the release of Ubuntu (or whichever <nowiki>[[http://distrowatch.com | distro]]</nowiki>) you are using.

It is up to the package project's team to get their package into the repositories for the various releases of the various distros.  Also it is up to the team developing a release to make sure that the repositories have plenty of the right sort of packages to meet people's needs. Think of a shop. Companies need to get their product onto shelves and shops need to show they have plenty to sell.  This saves individual users from having to identify the 'correct' website for a product and assess whether or not the site has been compromised and whether they are getting a genuine product or something stuffed full of malware.

The standard repositories are all free as are the Medibuntu repositories and most others that are easily found and added.  Theoretically there is nothing stopping a games manufacturer (for example) setting up a one-off or monthly charge for accessing a specialist repository. The ethics and licensing agreements would have to be looked into if people or companies chose this route. 

Adding or removing repositories is fairly easy.

=== Managing Repositories ===

Either from the top taskbar

'''System - Administrator - "Software Sources"'''

or from inside Synaptic using the '''Settings''' menu, select '''Repositories'''

The first tab of the pop-up is where Cd/Dvds can be added (or removed) as repositories to search.  Usually the various online "repos" are already included so you might be installing a more recent version of something that is listed on the Cd/dvd and also in the online repos.  The package manager will automatically choose the most recent by default although one of the other tabs in the pop-up can change the priorities, or in the '''Preferences''' pop-up from the '''Setttings''' menu. 

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/info.png]]</nowiki> As a front-end to apt, Synaptic uses the system-wide list of software repositories file located at
<pre>
/etc/apt/sources.list </pre>
 For more on managing software repositories, see the <nowiki>[[Repositories| Repositories wiki page]]</nowiki>.

=== Updating the Package List ===

Click '''Reload''' or press '''Ctrl + R''' to make Synaptic aware of the latest updates and any changes to the list of repositories.

Although this is done automatically when you open Synaptic it can be a good idea to update the database from time to time while running Synaptic.  The database is a list of packages on your system to keep track of installed software. All the package managers share the same list and the same list of repositories but each one presents the information slightly differently. The main time you will need to update the lists is when/if you have made changes to the list of software channels or if you have made changes to Synaptic's configuration. 

== Adding or Removing Software ==

== Adding Packages ==

=== Mark the Chosen Packages ===

** Right-click on each chosen package and choose '''Mark for Installation''' from the context menu, or press '''Ctrl + I'''. If the package requires the installation of another package, a dialog box appears:

  <nowiki>[[File:synaptic-confirm-mk.png]]</nowiki>

  <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/note.png]]</nowiki> Synaptic will warn you if your choices conflict with packages that are already installed on your system. If this is the case, the dialog box will show you any packages that need to be removed. If you are '''not sure''' you don't need the package(s) that will be removed, make sure you look up its function and use before you apply the changes you've made.

** Click '''Mark''' to allow the installation of the additional package(s).

=== Installing Packages ===

==== Without an Internet Connection ====
Search  for and "Mark" all the applications that you want to install/upgrade in the usual way but don't click the "Apply" button.  Instead use the '''File''' menu to "'''Generate a download Script'''".  

With no internet connection at all of course you wont be able to <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto?action=show&redirect=Synaptic#Updating%20the%20Package%20List | Update the Package List]]</nowiki> and so packages may be older versions.  An intermittent, occasional or slow connection could usefully update the list and then use the Script method to get updates via a 2nd machine which would not have to be running Ubuntu.  The Script is designed to work on Windows or Mac machines too. 

There are a few guides
* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Synaptic/PackageDownloadScript
* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Synaptic/Offline
or use apt-get instead of Synaptic
* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Offline
or an alternative approach, 'simply' download the entire repository!
* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Offline/Repository

==== With a Broadband Connection ====

** Once you are satisfied with your choices, click on '''Apply''' in the toolbar or press '''Ctrl + P'''.

** A dialog box appears with a summary of changes that will be made.

  <nowiki>[[File:synaptic-confirm-install.png]]</nowiki>

** Confirm the changes by clicking on '''Apply'''.

=== How to force the installation of a package version ===

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/note.png]]</nowiki> ''To be added: Why you would (and would not) want to force a specific version''

* To force the installation of a package different from the one chosen by Synaptic, do the following:

** Click '''Reload''' or press '''Ctrl + R''' to make Synaptic aware of the latest updates.

** Select the package. Choose '''Force Version''' from the '''Package''' menu.

** Select the version you would like to use. To confirm your decision, click '''Force'''.

** Click '''Apply''' on the toolbar or press '''Ctrl + P'''. A dialog appears with a summary of the changes that will be made to your system. To confirm, press '''Apply'''.

=== How to Install, but not every recommended package ===
* Open Preferences from the menu
** On the General tab, unmark "Consider recommended packages as dependencies"
* Restart Synaptic, and Install the package normally.

== Remove or Uninstall Packages ==

* '''To remove or 'completely remove' a package'''

** Right-click on the package and choose '''Mark for Removal''' from the context menu

** Once you're satisfied with your choices, click on '''Apply''' in the toolbar or press '''Ctrl + P'''.

** A dialog box appears with a summary of changes that will be made. Confirm the changes by clicking on '''Apply'''.

 <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/note.png]]</nowiki> The '''Mark for Complete Removal''' option instructs Synaptic to remove any configuration files associated with the package as well.

== To Upgrade a Package ==

** Click '''Reload''' or press '''Ctrl + R''' to make Synaptic aware of the latest updates.

** Right-click on the package and choose '''Mark for Upgrade''' from the context menu, or press '''Ctrl + U'''.

** Once you're satisfied with your choices, click on '''Apply''' in the toolbar or press '''Ctrl + P'''.  If the machine has no internet access then <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto?action=show&redirect=Synaptic#Without%20an%20Internet%20Connection | generate a download script]]</nowiki> instead of using "Apply"

** A dialog box appears with a summary of changes that will be made. Confirm the changes by clicking on '''Apply'''.

== How to keep your system up-to-date, including the Kernel ==

Synaptic provides two methods for upgrading your system:

* ''Smart Upgrade (Dist-Upgrade)'' -- ''recommended'' <<BR>> The smart upgrade method tries to resolve package conflicts. This includes installing additional dependencies (required packages) if needed and preferring packages with higher priority. Smart Upgrade has the same effect as the ''apt-get dist-upgrade'' tool on the command line.

* ''Default Upgrade'' <<BR>> The default upgrade method marks upgrades of installed packages only. If the new version of a package depends on not installed packages or coflicts with an already installed package, it will not be upgraded.

 <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/info.png]]</nowiki> '''Dist-upgrade''' is the default upgrade method used by Synaptic. To change the upgrade method,  choose '''Preferences''' from the '''Settings''' menu, then click on the '''General''' tab and adjust the '''System upgrade''' entry.

* To upgrade your system with Synaptic:

** Click '''Reload''' or press '''Ctrl + R''' to make Synaptic aware of the latest updates.

** Click '''Mark all Upgrades''' or press '''Ctrl + G'''.

** Click '''Apply''' on the toolbar or press '''Ctrl + P'''. A dialog appears with a summary of the changes that will be made to your system.

** Click '''Apply''' to confirm the changes and go ahead with the upgrade.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/info.png]]</nowiki> Synaptic works hand-in-hand with '''Update-Notifier''' and '''Update-Manager''' to inform you about updates to the software installed on your system.

'''Update-Notifier''' displays an icon in the notification area when updates are available. It will display a pop-up message and an icon in the notification area on your GNOME desktop.

<nowiki>[[File:update-notification.png]]</nowiki>

If you right click on the icon you see all the functions available, including what I think is a sensible default, Show Updates. This option runs another new program, '''Upgrade-Manager'''. The upgrade manager shows what packages the system wants to upgrade, which you can deselect from being upgraded if you wish. 

To update your system, click on the notification icon, enter your password and click OK.

Once all the packages are downloaded, the dpkg system installs the packages in the hidden terminal.  Questions that previously required interaction with the terminal now provide a Debconf interface using the GNOME frontend. The upgrade process never requires the user to access a terminal, which helps new users become comfortable with upgrading their system.

Ubuntu also makes basic APT configuration much easier for new users. It offers an interface to add or edit the entries in /etc/apt/sources.list which can be accessed through Synaptic or the preferences menu of the update-notifier. It shows the repositories that are currently listed, and provides an interface to edit them or add new repositories.

 <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/info.png]]</nowiki>  You can change the frequency of update checks in the '''Software Preferences''' panel. Choose '''Repositories''' from the '''Settings''' menu, then click on the '''Internet Updates''' tab and adjust the ''Check for updates'' entry.

 <nowiki>[[File:synaptic-check4updates.png]]</nowiki>

The only function that is somewhat lacking with the new Synaptic frontend is application installation. There is a new program called '''<nowiki>[[gnome-app-install]]</nowiki>''' that shows a simple list of common GNOME programs with a checkbox for installation or removal. gnome-app-install will list every package that provides a .desktop icon in the GNOME application menu. In other words, basically every major gui program will be listed.

== Information Gathering ==
=== Locating software on your system ===

Synaptic can tell you about every file that belongs to a software package it knows about and show you where it is located on your system. Search the database for the software package you are interested in and select it in Synaptic's main window. Next, click on the ''Installed Files'' tab to see a list of all files and where they are.

=== View the Changelog of a Package ===

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/note.png]]</nowiki> Applies to native Debian ('''.deb''') packages only

You can view the changelog of a package with Synaptic. Select a package, then choose '''Download Changelog''' from the '''Package''' menu.

=== View History ===

You can easily keep track of all changes made to your system's software configuration. To view the history log file, choose ''History'' from the ''File'' menu.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/note.png]]</nowiki> The history log only shows changes made with Synaptic.

== Status Icons ==

The following icons are used to indicate the status of a package in the package list:

  <nowiki>[[File:synaptic-icon-legend.png]]</nowiki>

== Troubleshooting ==

=== How to fix broken packages ===

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> 'Broken packages' are packages that have unsatisfied dependencies. If broken packages are detected, Synaptic will not allow any further changes to the system until all broken packages have been fixed.

* '''To fix broken packages'''

** Choose '''Edit''' > '''Fix Broken Packages''' from the menu.

** Choose '''Apply Marked Changes''' from the '''Edit''' menu or press '''Ctrl + P'''.

** Confirm the summary of changes and click '''Apply'''.

If that does not help, then please follow this procedure:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PackageManagerTroubleshootingProcedure

=== How to free disk space ===
Settings -> Preferences -> Files -> Delete downloaded packages after installation
then click Delete Cached Package Files.

=== Broken Upgrade or Installation ===
* What to do if an installation process fails and you find it is no longer possible to install or remove packages:
** Open a Terminal and type the following commands, pressing the Return or Enter key after each (you may have to type in your <nowiki>[[RootSudo|password]]</nowiki>):
  <pre>
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt-get install -f
</pre>

=== Browser works, Synaptic will not ===
(note: probably inaccurate or outdated)

If the router is set to auto discover DNS then Synaptic will fail. Resolve this by setting up a static ip address and manually set DNS ip in router. Now Ubuntu (system-administration-networking) config static ip and enter your ISP dns ip and delete router DNS ip which will look something like 192.168.1.1
