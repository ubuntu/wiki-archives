Here is a list of tools for secure deletion of data stored on hard discs. Note that the security of these tools has not been well-established. They might prove vulnerable to a much greater extent than advertised by the authors.

Do also note that the need to use such tools at all on modern disks is <nowiki>[[http://www.nber.org/sys-admin/overwritten-data-gutmann.html|disputed]]</nowiki>. Also, remember that copies of the data may be stored in temporary/cache files, file system slack (old data in partly used blocks), bad blocks, file system journals and other places.
