__TOC__

This player's firmware supports MSC and should behave as a normal USB storage device when configured properly.  Users can simply manage their files using a file browser (like Nautilus or Dolphin).

Works flawlessly under K/Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope.  This player should work under any reasonably recent operating system.
