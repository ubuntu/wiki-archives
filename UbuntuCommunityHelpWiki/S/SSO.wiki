== Single Sign-On / OpenID provider service ==

SSO (https://login.ubuntu.com/) is the central user account system used by all other services at Canonical -- such as Launchpad, wiki.ubuntu.com, and Software Center.  It is also used by a variety of third-party services as a generic OpenID provider.  The development for SSO is hosted on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/canonical-identity-provider
