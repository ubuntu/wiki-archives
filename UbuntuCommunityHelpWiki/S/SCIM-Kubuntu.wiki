== SKIM ==
SCIM can be used in Kubuntu, though via another helper application aptly named '''SKIM'''.  It's fairly easy to install, and the majority of the steps needed is identical to the ones needed to install SCIM.

Other wiki entries on this subject suggest adding the Japanese Ubuntu repository. While not needed, it does contain updated versions of the packages you need installed as well as some outright missing from the normal repositories.

=== Installation ===
==== Packages ====
Enter the following in a terminal to download and install all needed packages.
 <pre>
sudo aptitude install skim scim-anthy ~nscim-bridge scim-gtk2-immodule
</pre>

==== Set as default IM ====
Per default, KDE won't use SCIM as the default IM, so SKIM won't work. Enter the following in a terminal.
 <pre>
sudo im-switch -s skim
</pre>
This will set the IM to be used for the '''current locale''' to SKIM. In some cases, it won't be a true locale, but rather a catch-all '''all_ALL''' (as compared to en_US, en_GB, sv_SE, etc). If you want to make sure you have it set for a specific locale, call the same command but with an added argument; '''-z ''lang_LANG'' '''. Example follows.
 <pre>
sudo im-switch -s skim -z en_US
</pre>
If it returns an error message saying that input method cannot be chosen for that locale, enter the following and then retry the above command afterwards. Replace ''lang_LANG'' with the locale in question.
 <pre>
sudo update-alternatives --install /etc/alternatives/xinput-lang_LANG xinput-lang_LANG /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/skim 0
</pre>

==== Enter SKIM ====
As mentioned, SKIM is merely the KDE helper application that interacts with the real SCIM. At this point, with SCIM set as the default IM, upon restart of X SCIM will automatically load, and launch its own helper application, preempting SKIM. To prevent this, you want to open up SKIM and set it to automatically load upon startup. It should be available via your application menu, though you can start it manually via a terminal or a run box.
 <pre>
skim &
</pre>
An icon should pop up in your system tray. Right-click it, and hit Configure.

In the ''Frontend / General SCIM'' section, go to the ''Other'' tab and select ''Panel Program:'' '''scim-panel-kde''', as well as ''Config Module:'' '''kconfig'''. Likewise, in the ''X Window'' section, check '''Start skim automatically when KDE starts'''.

==== IM configuration file ====
The "skim" we've so far been referring to is actually a file named skim, located in ''/etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d''. Per default it is incomplete, missing entries to make programs that rely on XIM for input work with SCIM.

Open it up in a text editor with superuser persmissions, such as by running the following in a terminal or a run box (Alt+F2).
 <pre>
kdesudo kate /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/skim &
</pre>

Paste the following contents into the file and save it.
 <pre>
XIM=SCIM
XIM_PROGRAM=/usr/bin/skim
XIM_ARGS="-d"
XIM_PROGRAM_SETS_ITSELF_AS_DAEMON=yes

if [ -e /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/*/immodules/im-scim-bridge.so ]; then
    GTK_IM_MODULE=scim-bridge
elif [ -e /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/*/immodules/im-scim.so ]; then
    GTK_IM_MODULE=scim
else
    GTK_IM_MODULE=xim
fi
if [ -e /usr/lib/qt3/plugins/inputmethods/im-scim-bridge.so ] || [ -e /usr/lib/qt4/plugins/inputmethods/im-scim-bridge.so ]; then
    QT_IM_MODULE=scim-bridge
elif [ -e /usr/lib/qt3/plugins/inputmethods/libqscim.so ]; then
    QT_IM_MODULE=scim
else
    QT_IM_MODULE=xim
fi

DEPENDS="skim, scim-bridge-client-gtk | scim-bridge-client-qt | scim-bridge-client-qt4 | scim-gtk2-immodule | scim-qtimm"
</pre>

At this point you need to restart X, such as by rebooting, or logging out and hitting Ctrl+Alt+Backspace.
** '''NOTE:''' Zapping (the Ctrl+Alt+Backspace shortcut) will be disabled in 9.04 Jaunty. To restart the X server, you would instead need to switch to a text console, such as by hitting Ctrl+Alt+F1. Login, and then enter the following
   <pre>
sudo service kdm restart
</pre>
   Replace '''kdm''' with '''gdm''' if for some reason you're using GNOME's login manager.

=== Configuration ===
For general SKIM configuration, access the configuration window via its system tray icon. For language specific support (such as Anthy for Japanese), you may need to open up '''SCIM''''s configuration window, however.
Enter the following in a terminal or a run box.
 <pre>
scim-setup &
</pre>

==== The following guide is for people who want to install SKIM for Chinese/Japanese/Korean input on Kubuntu. ====

For users wanting to set up Chinese/Japanese/Korean on Ubuntu using SCIM, click <nowiki>[[SCIM|HERE]]</nowiki>

The guide below was created with a view to enabling Chinese input.

Substitute any selection for the Chinese language for a language of your choice to enable input for said language. Provided it's supported by SCIM of course.

== Installation and Setup for 6.06 ==
  1. Select '''KMenu -> System -> Language Support''' (in Kubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 it is '''KMenu -> System Settings -> Regional & Language -> Add     language''')
     <nowiki>[[File:LanguageSelection.png]]</nowiki>
     

  1. Select Chinese from the language list, click 'Apply', and allow the package manager Adept to finish downloading the language pack 

  1. Close the Adept window when the download is complete

  1. Right click the SKIM icon in your taskbar and select '''Configuration -> General SCIM -> "Other" Tab'''
     Under the 'Panel Program' dropdown, select 'scim-panel-kde'
     Under the 'Config Module' dropdown, select 'kconfig'
     <nowiki>[[File:SKIM_PanelConfig.png]]</nowiki>

  1. If your default language coincides with your new input language (e.g. Installed Chinese input for a Chinese desktop), Go onto to ''step 6''.
        For users utilizing different default and input languages (e.g. Chinese input for an English Desktop).
        Open up Konsole and type: 
        <pre>
mkdir ~/.xinput.d
cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/scim-pinyin ~/.xinput.d/default
        }}}

  1. Restart KDE by logging out and back in, or typing <code>sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart</code>.

  1. Once you are logged in, you should be able to activate SKIM with CTRL-Space or SHIFT-Space within any application that allows keyboard inputs.

      e.g. 
       i. Start Kate
       i. Press CTRL-Space. A SKIM toolbar would have poped up.
       i. Choose Chinese input -> Smart PinYin on the SKIM toolbar
       i. You can now input Chinese in Kate
       <nowiki>[[File:SKIM_UpAndRunning.png]]</nowiki>

To switch back to the default language of your desktop, press the shortcut key in (ii), which is used to toggle between the desktop default language and the input method set up in (iii).

If you encountered any problems during the installation, check the <nowiki>[[#ProblemsSection|Problems Section]]</nowiki> for possible solutions.

=== For 6.10 and 7.04 users: ===

You have to tell the system you want to use SCIM as the input method for your locale.

  1.    To find out which locale you are using open up Konsole and type:
        {{{
locale | grep LANG= }}}
        you will get something like
        {{{
LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 }}}

  1.    Now open up Konsole and type: 
        {{{
im-switch -z de_DE.UTF-8 -s scim }}}
        Replace "de_DE.UTF-8" with what you got from your first command.

=== For 8.04 users: ===

You do not have know the locale to use SCIM - there is "catch-all" called ''all_ALL'' that covers all locales for this purpose (see ''man im-switch'' for more information). Also, you should use ''scim-bridge'' instead of ''scim''. Hence:

  1.    Open up Konsole and type: 
        {{{
im-switch -z all_ALL -s scim-bridge }}}
        

== Problems Section ==

==== PROBLEM ====

Some of the Chinese characters that I'm entering show up as big black dots!
<nowiki>[[File:Problem_BlackDotChar.png]]</nowiki>

__ SOLUTION __

Chances are whatever application you are using isn't set to a font which can handle the full set of Chinese characters. Kate for example defaults to the 'DejaVu Sans', which though can handle a large number of Chinese characters, doesn't actually support the full set. 

Switch to something like 'AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni' which by default comes with Kubuntu (to do this go: '''Settings Menu -> Configure Kate -> Fonts & Colors -> Fonts tab). '''

Also, the entire KDE desktop font can be changed from:
'''KMenu -> System Settings -> Appearance -> Fonts'''

However, different applications have different ways of setting the fonts, so don't hesitate to do some exploring if you encounter this problem in a new application.

==== PROBLEM ====

I get a

   ''Could not read network connection list.''

   ''/home/<username>/DCOPserver_mini-desktop_ _0''

error everytime KDE starts up
(where <username> is the name you login with).
NB: There aren't actually any spaces between the underscores.

__ SOLUTION __

See if the problem is fixed by reboots, if not you can try delaying the sequence that im-switch loads in:

{{{
cd /etc/X11/Xsession.d/
sudo mv 90im-switch 98im-switch
</pre>
