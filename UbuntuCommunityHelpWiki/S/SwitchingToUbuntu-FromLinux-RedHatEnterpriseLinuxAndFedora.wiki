__TOC__



It is easy to apply your existing knowledge of ''Red Hat Enterprise Linux'' or ''Fedora'' to Ubuntu. The key differences between them are covered in this article.

=== Administrative Tasks ===
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora by default, each administrative user needs to know the root password, in addition to their own password.

In Ubuntu, each user only has one password. Users in the '''admin''' group can run command line and graphical applications with elevated privileges. Graphical admin tools prompt for this password when run, and command line tools can be run with root-privileges using <nowiki>[[RootSudo|sudo]]</nowiki>. 

=== Package Management ===

Ubuntu has more packages available than Fedora, so you'll have a better chance of finding what you want in the repositories. As with Fedora, graphical applications will put a link into the '''Applications''' menu.  

==== Graphical Tools ====
The '''Synaptic package Manager''' is an excellent tool for finding, fetching and installing packages. Press '''System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager''' to start Synaptic.

==== Command Line Tools ====
Ubuntu uses ''apt-get'' instead of ''yum'', ''up2date'' and so on to find, download, and install packages and their dependencies.

Note that, unlike yum, apt-get is only for packages available in repositories - it cannot handle packages you have already downloaded. The dpkg command is used instead.

==== Table of Equivalent Commands ====

Below is a table of equivalent commands for package management on both Ubuntu/Debian and Red Hat/Fedora systems.

=== Services ===

Services on Ubuntu are managed in a broadly similar way to those on Red Hat.

==== Graphical Tools ====

Services can be configured by clicking '''System''' -> '''Administration''' -> '''Services'''. A tool called <nowiki>[[http://www.marzocca.net/linux/bum.html|Boot-Up Manager]]</nowiki> is also available.

==== Command Line Tools ====

Below is a table of example commands for managing services. The ''apache''/''httpd'' service is used as an example.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <rowstyle="background: #D9BB7A; text-align:center"> '''Task'''
| '''Red Hat / Fedora'''
| '''Ubuntu'''
| '''Ubuntu''' <<BR>> (with sysv-rc-conf or sysvconfig)
|-
| '''Starting/stopping services immediately'''
| service httpd start
| invoke-rc.d apache start
| service apache start
|-
| '''Enabling a service at boot'''
| chkconfig httpd on
| update-rc.d apache defaults
| sysv-rc-conf apache on
|-
| '''Disabling a service at boot'''
| chkconfig httpd off
| update-rc.d apache purge
| sysv-rc-conf apache off
|}

'''Note:''' Whereas Red Hat and Fedora servers boot into runlevel 3 by default, Ubuntu servers default to runlevel 2.

'''Note:''' The `service` and `invoke-rc.d` commands call init scripts to do the actual work.  You can also start and stop services by doing e.g. `/etc/init.d/apache start` on Ubuntu, or `/etc/init.d/httpd start` on Red Hat/Fedora.

=== Network ===

==== Graphical Tools ====

Fedora/RHEL have system-config-network, ubuntu pre 10.04 had <nowiki>[[http://www.debianadmin.com/ubuntu-networking-for-basic-and-advanced-users.html| gnome-nettool]]</nowiki> to edit static ip address, since 10.04 nm-connection-editor is the best choice. For Ubuntu 10.04 Studio there is only manual editing of files <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-system-tools/+bug/570828| since NetworkMontor is not included ]]</nowiki>
