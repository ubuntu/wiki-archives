== Intrusion Detection ==

As a part of your comprhensive security management the '''samhain''' host based intrusion detection system (HIDS) should be an integral component.

HIDS is a proactive measure to help avoid rootkits, unplanned system changes and other potentially nefarious activity.

== Samhain Labs, samhain IDS ==

Samhain is a full system integrity monitoring and reporting application designed to alert you, good sysadmin, to suspect changes and activities on your host(s).

Samhain operates in a client/server daemon environment. Host file checksums and properties are centrally stored in a variety of database servers. e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.

Extra documentation, details and FAQ's at: http://www.la-samhna.de/samhain

Choose a supported database server and have it installed and pre-configured prior to configuring samhain. I've chosen ''PostgreSQL''.
