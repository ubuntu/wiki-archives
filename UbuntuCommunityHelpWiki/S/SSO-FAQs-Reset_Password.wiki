== I forgot my password. How can I get into my account? ==

This is usually a fairly easy issue to fix.  Simply go to the SSO site ( https://login.ubuntu.com/ or https://login.launchpad.net/ ) and click the link which says "Forgot your password?".  Then follow the instructions on-screen.  The system should email you a code you can use to verify your identity, and then it will let you log in and create a new password.
