The typical networking setup for a small business looks something like this:

<pre>

                       Router
                     /   |   \
              Server1    |    Server2
               +---------+---------+
               |         |         |
        Workstations  Printers   Other Devices
</pre>
                          
By default, the router typically gives out your network addresses.

We need to go into the router and disable the routers DHCP server (as the Small Business Server will need to do that going forwards).  In most cases, disabling the DHCP server is a simple matter of unchecking a box in the routers configuration file. 

While it is beyond the scope of this wiki page to outline how to do that with every router, the following are links to common routers:
