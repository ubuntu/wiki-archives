=== Causes and Solutions ===
These errors can be due to a variety of reasons:

*** bad memory modules (solution: use memtest86+ to check your memory)
*** a bad dvd drive (solution: if possible, try using a different cd/dvd drive)
*** bad data cable (solution: change it for a new one)
*** bad media (solution: try burning the iso image to a new disc)
*** a corrupted iso image (solution: run an md5 checksum, and if they don't match, download the iso image again)

=== Temporary Workarounds ===
Some users have reported that adding the ide=nodma or acpi=off allowed them to work around this issue (which proved to be bad memory modules). You might want to give that a try

Successful boot was achieved by adding "all_generic_ide" to the grub boot line for the live CD. 

You can add those lines to the grub entry, either in the grub.conf file or either entering letter 'e' on the grub menu and after editing Control+x to boot:

Add to the grub line: 
<pre>
all_generic_ide pci=nommconf
</pre>

Add to the kernel line: 
<pre>
ide=nodma acpi=off
</pre>
