== Test for Card ==

You can search your connected hardware for your device and its properties.

=== PCI ===
You can look for your sound card among your PCI devices by running lspci from a command prompt. Typically a sound card will be listed as "Multimedia audio controller: <make> <model> (<revision>)".

=== USB ===

USB devices can be found by running lsusb from a command prompt.

=== Other ===

Other hardware interfaces to a card require different tests specific to their interface.

== Tested Cards ==

These cards have a hardware MIDI synthesiser that works in linux:
* Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZX
* Sound Blaster Audigy 2 Platinum
* Sound Blaster Audigy
* Sound Blaster Live!
* Sound Blaster Awe 64 Value
* Avance Logic ALS4000 (OPL3 FM synth)
(Add your card here if you've got it to work.)

For instructions on getting one of these working, see MidiHardwareSynthesisSetup

== Not Supported ==

For all cards that do not support synthesis in hardware, see MidiSoftwareSynthesisHowTo
