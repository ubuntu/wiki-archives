== Can I cancel/delete my Launchpad account? ==

Yes.  You can deactivate an account, but it won't be entirely deleted.

If you don't want your data there any more, we recommend that you anonymize your account before deactivating it.  This can be done by changing your display name and username, removing pictures and crypto keys, etc.

To deactivate your LP account, do the following:

# Go to your profile page.
# Click "Change details" in the upper right.
# Scroll all the way to the bottom.
# Click "Deactivate your account."
# If you want, type in a reason for deactivating your account.
# Click "Deactivate Account".

You can also go directly to the page by typing in this address:

    https://launchpad.net/~yourusername/+deactivate-account

Replace yourusername in the URL with the name of your account.
