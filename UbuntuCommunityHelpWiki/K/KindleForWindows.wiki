== Overview ==
     While Amazon does not offer a native Kindle reader for Linux, they do offer the <nowiki>[[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDwQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fread.amazon.com%2F&ei=K_XeUY7VIIev4APzo4GQAw&usg=AFQjCNHN-nY3LJmcwcOAakqDAVqO8rcm8g&sig2=3inDhr51zE-e2_SxGCobmg&bvm=bv.48705608,d.dmg‎|"Kindle Cloud Reader"]]</nowiki> which allows you to read your material using a web browser. The cloud reader has an offline reading component that works with both Chromium and Firefox. However, some of us would rather have an actual installed application along with the additional features that come with it. This is possible using Wine to install the "Kindle Reading App for Windows". The installation does require some post installation configuration before it will run correctly.

=== Getting the Software ===

Will be completed Friday July 11th.
