Your make-kpkg kernel may not automatically load capabilities. This is how to add it:

Start with your custom kernel and do following:

<pre>
$ echo capability | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
sudo mkinitrd -o /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) $(uname -r)
</pre>

If you use a bootloader not handling changes by itself (e.g. lilo) you have to tell it about the new initrd.img.

Subject: uname -r  ??

The commands above uses uname -r to get the version of the running kernel.

If you are setting up a kernel to boot it, you are not yet running it. All references to uname -r should be changed to the new kernel name...
