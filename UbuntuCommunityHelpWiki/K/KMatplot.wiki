== Introduction ==

'''KMatplot''' is a tool for plotting data sets in either two or three dimensions. It can plot many types of 2d plots, including pixmaps and contours, and 3d surfaces. Regardless it doesn't include statistic tools, it's a very usefull ploting software, since it offers a full WYSIWYG mode with multiple objects on a single page.

== Geting started ==
Kmatplot works in base to 2 working units: Worksheet and Page.
Worksheets allows you to load all data you will need for ploting. The very first steps to start working with kmatplot are as follows:
1. Create a new worksheet window: ''Windows > New window > Worksheets''
2. Create a new worksheet: ''Worksheets > New sheet''
3. By selecting the new created sheet (Unnamed, before saving), we can either start introducing our data or import them from a ''*.txt'' format table: ''Worksheets > Import data''

Once the data have been loaded, we can start setting up our plot by creating a neew Page (''Page > New page'') and editing it. Alternatively, you can use the wizard (''Graph > Wizard'') and modify the result it offers to you.

Finally, you can export the plot to several image formats (''Page > Export image'').
