__TOC__


As well as using your mouse to operate software, you can also use your keyboard to perform specific functions. This page provides a list of '''keyboard shortcuts''' which you may find useful.

=== How to use a keyboard shortcut ===

Traditionally, keyboard shortcuts are written like so: '''Alt + F1'''. This means that you should press the '''Alt''' and '''F1''' keys simultaneously. This is normally best achieved by holding down the ''modifier'' key (such as Ctrl or Alt or the Super(windows logo) key) and then pressing the second key once. You can then release the modifier key.

=== Finding keyboard shortcuts ===

==== Finding system keyboard shortcuts ====

To find (and change) system-level keyboard shortcuts, one can (at least in later, GNOME-based distros, e.g. ubuntu karmic) run the '''Keyboard Shortcuts''' applet, e.g. via System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts on the main menu.

==== Finding application-specific keyboard shortcuts ====

While there are many standard keyboard shortcuts (see below), most applications also have keyboard shortcuts which are specific to themselves. These can normally be found in the pull-down menus at the top of the application's screen. The example below shows a menu in ''Open''''''Office.org Writer'', with the keyboard shortcuts highlighted:

These might not work for everyone, but can help with accessibility issues:

'''Alt Gr+Space''' Scrolls current tab/window down.

'''Alt Gr+Backspace''' Scrolls current tab/window up. 
You may find '''Alt Gr+Shift+Space''' works if Alt Gr+Backspace does not.

If you don't have Alt Gr, it might be labelled something else. It's usually to the right of the space bar.

See <nowiki>[[http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly|Mozilla Support]]</nowiki> for a full list of keyboard shortcuts in Firefox.

Press '''Tools''' ▸ '''Customize…''' ▸ '''Keyboard''' to change keyboard shortcuts in !LibreOffice.

=== Laptop Function Shortcuts ===

Many laptops have function ('''Fn''') keys which you can hold down to access more functions on the laptop's keyboard. A list of these functions should be available from the manufacturer of the laptop.

=== Text Entry Shortcuts ===

If you want to have quick access to lines of text by using a hotkey, for example to enter your email address in forms, then you can use xbindkeys. Xbindkeys has a GUI utility to allow easy settings of hotkeys, but be aware that it's a little more complicated than the default Ubuntu Shortcutkeys interface.

Install xbindkeys  
<pre>
sudo apt-get install xbindkeys
</pre>
Create the default config file for xbindkeys
<pre>
xbindkeys --defaults > /home/your-user-name/.xbindkeysrc
</pre>
When thats done, install xbindkeys-config, the GUI for xbindkeys
<pre>
sudo apt-get install xbindkeys-config
</pre>
Now the utility that actually does the "typing"
<pre>
sudo apt-get install xvkbd
</pre>
Once each is installed, start both applications by bringing up "Run Application" with ALT -F2.
<pre>
xbindkeys
</pre>and
<pre>
xbindkeys-config
</pre> 

To keep the xbindkeys hotkeys active when you next start the computer you will have to add a new session, System --> Preferences --> Sessions. Put in the command "xbindkeys" into the command field (without the quotes).

You should be able to see the "Xbindkeys Config" window. Start a new hotkey. Hit "New" on the bottom row of buttons. Then use the edit area at the top right. Give the hotkey a name. Hit the "GetKey" button to set the keypress for a hotkey. Some hotkeys may conflict with other hotkeys on the system (a window will open or a compiz plugin will activate). If this happens then choose another combination like CTRL - ALT - F for example.

Now put the command to activate with that hotkey in the "Action" field. This can be anything, but to allow for the entry of a line of text into part of the GUI enter 

<pre>
xvkbd -xsendevent -text "myemail@server.com"
</pre>

The example shows an email address but it can be any line of text. Now hit "Apply" and test the hotkey in a Firefox field, text editor, or anywhere that text can be entered. Please note that using "Run Action" will not be able to test the command in xbindkeys-config, you will have to test it somewhere else.

==== Replacing keys with other keys ====
If you want to use xbindkeys to override certain keys on your keyboard, you can catch them with xbindkeys, and then emit new keypresses using xmacro. To install xmacro, use:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install xmacro
</pre>

After this, you can find out the commands for specific keypresses by starting xmacrorec:

<pre>
xmacrorec :0.0
</pre>

First give it the key which will allow you to quit the app, then press the keys you want to know the codes for. After this, you can use those codes in the commands you tell xbindkeys to run, for example:

<pre>
xmacroplay-keys :0.0 KeyStr Next
</pre>

will simulate a key press of the PageDown key. Thus, in my .xbindkeysrc the following contents

<pre>
"xmacroplay-keys :0.0 KeyStr Prior"
  XF86Back

"xmacroplay-keys :0.0 KeyStr Next"
  XF86Forward
</pre>

will turn the Backward/Forward buttons on my Thinkpad T41 into PageDown and PageUp keys, and will no longer disturb my browsing as I accidentally press those Backward/Forward while browsing.
