== Introduction ==
K``Smooth``Dock is a desktop toolbar (similar to KDE's kicker) for KDE 3.2 and above with two smooth zooming modes, normal and parabolic. It's aim is to provide a cool alternative or complement to kicker. As it is intended for KDE/Linux, it's behavior is similar to kicker in many ways.

<nowiki>[[File:ksmoothdock-1.jpg]]</nowiki>

== Installation ==
The recommended installation procedure in Kubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) or 6.06 (Dapper) is to build K``Smooth``Dock from source code. While this may seem intimidating to a new Linux user, the process is quite simple.

=== System Preparation ===
1. Install the libraries and utilities necessary to build the K``Smooth``Dock program (KDE 3.2 or above libraries, C++ programming language, and automake-1.9).
<pre>
sudo apt-get install kdebase-dev build-essential automake1.9
</pre>

2. Review any version release notes <nowiki>[[http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=6585|kde-apps.org]]</nowiki>

3. /!\ Download the ''ksmoothdock-4.3_automake1.9.tar.gz'' source file to the '''Desktop''' using the following commands.
<pre>
cd ~/Desktop
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ksmoothdock/ksmoothdock-4.3_automake1.9.tar.gz
</pre>

        If you save the file to another directory, make sure to alter the path in the second line of the next step to reflect your local location.

=== Compile the Program ===
1. Create unpack the source code to the /opt dir
<pre>
cd /opt
sudo tar -xzvf ~/Desktop/ksmoothdock-4.3_automake1.9.tar.gz
cd ksmoothdock*		
</pre>

2. Compile the source code and install the program
<pre>
./configure
sudo make install
</pre>

3. Test run the K``Smooth``Dock program
<pre>
ksmoothdock	
</pre>

4. Choose initial setup configuration <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:001-welcome-setup.png]]</nowiki>

5. Press ''<ctrl-c>'' to stop K``Smooth``Dock once you are sure it starts correctly. Below we will configure KDE to launch K``Smooth``Dock as part of the start-up process.

==== Troubleshooting ====
/!\ If nothing happens when you run "ksmoothdock", it is likely that your KDE desktop is not installed in the standard location. In this case, there are two things to try.
<pre>
cd /opt/ksmoothdock-4.3_automake1.9/src
./ksmoothdock 	
</pre>
	- or -
<pre>
cd /opt/ksmoothdock-4.3_automake1.9
./configure --prefix=/YOUR_KDE_DIR
sudo make install 	
</pre>

=== KSmoothDock Autostart ===

To have K``Smooth``Dock start automatically at start-up, create a link to the program in the Autostart directory with the following script.
<pre>
ln -s /usr/bin/ksmoothdock ~/.kde/Autostart	
</pre>

== KSmoothDock Configuration ==

To access the various options in K``Smooth``dock, right click on the tool bar over one of the various icons on the bar. 

1. Right clicking over the KDE menu or an application icon will display the following menu. <<BR>><nowiki>[[File:016-menu-1.png]]</nowiki>

2. Right clicking over a virtual desktop icon will display two menu items that launch KDE System Settings screens for desktop configuration.

  a. Configure Desktop Wallpaper
  a. Configure Desktop Screen Saver

3. Left clicking on the clock will bring up a calendar. <<BR>><nowiki>[[File:005-calendar.png]]</nowiki>

4. Right clicking over the clock will bring up the ''Configure Clock'' menu. 

=== Edit Quick Launch Menu ===
The K``Smooth``Dock Quick Launch Menu can be synchronized with a menu folder from the main KDE menu, or maintained independently. 

/!\ It is recommended that you do NOT synchronize to a menu folder with a large number of items. Having more than 10-15 quick launch items can cause the ends of the K``Smooth``Dock tool bar to extend off the screen, especially if used simultaneously with the task bar feature.

=== Edit Preferences ===
==== Panel Components ====
The panel components tab enables or disables components of the panel. The components will be displayed on the panel in the order listed below.
# '''Quick launch menu''' is always enabled, but all items can be removed using the Quick Launch Menu Editor if a minimal look with no application icons is desired.
# '''Pager''' displays an icon in the tool bar for each virtual desktop. The icon displayed will be the current wallpaper for the specific desktop.
# '''Taskbar''' will display the icons of each application currently running, with the additional option of showing applications from all desktops, or only the current desktop.
# '''Clock''' enables or disables the current system time display.

==== Icon Zooming ====
K``Smooth``Dock can be switched between normal zooming where the size of the icon currently under the mouse is increased, or parabolic zooming where the icons to the left and right of the current icon are also increased in size to create a proportional wave effect across the panel. 

The zooming speed can also be adjusted to be less CPU intensive or simply for effect.

==== Arrangement ====
The K``Smooth``Dock panel can be placed at the top, bottom, right or left of the screen, but it is recommended that it not be in the same space as the default KDE kicker unless the length of both panels is carefully considered to avoid conflicting with each other. See Tips below for more ideas about how to arrange these complementary tools.

The arrangement options also control the the minimum and maximum size of the icons while zooming in both normal and parabolic modes, as well as the base amount of icon information loaded for quick launch items. It is recommended that the base size be equal to the maximum size of the zoomed icon for sharpest display.

==== Hiding ====
The K``Smooth``Dock panel can be set to automatically hide, similar to KDE's kicker panel. 

/!\ If your panel will not become visible again after hiding, try either killing the panel process or restarting X-Windows. If you do have any issues related to this, or any other feature, please let the development team know so we can address it.

==== Appearance ====
The colors and presence of a panel border and various other display items are configurable in this section.

==== Misc ====
The panel opacity can be configured in this section. Currently K``Smooth``Dock only supports a simulated transparency effect by displaying the current desktop wallpaper as a panel background. Please see the application website for more technical details on why transparency in KDE is just not stable enough to implement in K``Smooth``Dock at this time.

==== Tooltips ====
The size, font, and color of tooltips for the panel icons can be configured, or the tooltip feature can be disabled entirely.

==== Clock ====
The font, format (12h or 24h), and color of the clock can be configured.

== Tips ==

K``Smooth``Dock and the existing KDE kicker panel can "co-exist quietly and peacefully" in a couple ways. 

1. Try choosing a screen arrangement location different than where K``Smooth``Dock will be running. For example, set kicker to run at the top of the screen and K``Smooth``Dock at the bottom. Also try the  kicker autohide feature to remove it from view unless specifically opened by moving the mouse to the top of the screen or a specific corner.

2. Remove all the components from the kicker panel except the system tray, and set it to 10% width in a bottom corner of the screen. Combined with autohide, and setting the "Raise when the pointer touches the bottom left corder of the screen", kicker won't be popping up unless you specifically move the mouse to bring up the system tray.
