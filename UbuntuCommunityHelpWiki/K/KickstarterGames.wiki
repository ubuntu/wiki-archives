 :: Genre: Exploration and Combat Platformer
 :: Linux status: "We will be looking into porting the game to other platforms, but they will not be available on launch with the PC version. A Mac version is most likely be the first port we make.We've recieved some request for a Linux port so we got in contact with a specialist in porting games to Linux that was suggested to us by a number of you in emails. The engine the game is built does not currently have support for Linux, and we won't know if we will get what we need to make it happen until a few months from now. The first steps have been taken, but this is where the port for Linux stands right now.
 If they are possible the ports will take some time, but we will give it our best."

 :: Genre: Tactical shooter (like Rainbow Six and SWAT)
 :: Linux status: "Consoles / Linux / Mac
 This is something we've received a lot of questions about. As of now our focus is the PC version of the game BUT if we exceed our fundraising goals we are putting every cent back into the development of this game. That means if we receive the neccesary funds to hire additional platform engineers and leads to bring the game to linux or mac for only 10 users we will. That's not to say there's only 10 linux and mac users out there (since we've recieved many more requests than that!), the point I am making is that our goal is to make an amazing game and put it in as many players hands as possible."
