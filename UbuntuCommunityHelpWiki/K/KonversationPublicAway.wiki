__TOC__

A lot of people use Konversation irc client, but keep the public away message feature on. This can be quite irritating, and can can get you banned/kicked on a few irc channels. 

Here is how to turn it off. 

* Open Konversation. Choose '''Settings''' -> '''Identities''' (or hit F8)
* Click on '''Away''' tab
* Uncheck the '''Show away messages''' checkbox
