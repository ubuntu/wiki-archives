== Installing K9Copy from the Repositories ==
K9Copy requires the ''multiverse'' repository - enable this in ''Software Sources''

<nowiki>[[File:software-sources.png]]</nowiki>

Search for the package <code>k9copy</code> in <nowiki>[[SynapticHowto| Synaptic]]</nowiki>, Adept, KPackageKit, or other package manager.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/terminal.png]]</nowiki> Or, to install via <nowiki>[[UsingTheTerminal| terminal]]</nowiki>:
 <pre>
 sudo apt-get install k9copy}}}

== Using K9Copy ==
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/menu.png]]</nowiki> K9Copy should now appear under '''Menu -> Applications -> Sound & Video''' in Gnome (Ubuntu) or  '''Menu -> Multimedia''' in KDE (Kubuntu) or XFCE (Xubuntu). You can also start K9Copy from a command-line terminal (or by pressing Alt + F2):
{{{
 k9copy
</pre>

=== Quickstart guide ===
K9Copy works in both KDE and Gnome.  To copy a normal DVD and shrink it down to 4.7Gb, set the input device to your DVD and output as ISO image. Open the video using the 'folder' icon at top left.  Under the MPEG4 Encoding tab, select Video codec as copy.  Ticking the 2 pass box will give a higher quality copy.  Set file size to say, 4700MB (note that there have been reports <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=186273|e.g.]]</nowiki> that this value is sometimes slightly exceeded).  

Select the title(s) of interest.  Then press the circular to DVD icon.  It will ask for a location to create the iso copy.  Note that when it starts, it misleadingly says 'Burning DVD' - what its actually doing is creating the iso copy on the hard drive - rest assured the DVD is NOT being overwritten!
A dvd can then be created from the resulting iso file with another program eg. Nautilus (right click on the iso) or <nowiki>[[K3b]]</nowiki>.  Although k9copy can also burn the iso (or a DVD structure), using a separate program has been reported to be more reliable. 

Tip: To preview the titles, highlight the title/chapter of interest and click on the 'movie camera' icon - only THEN can you use the stop/play buttons in the preview window.

If you wish to change the Menu structure (reauthor the DVD), you can use qdvdauthor.

=== Using k9copy with NTFS DVDs ===
When using k9copy as a front-end to mencoder (as the encoder), NTFS video can be accommodated by adding (or changing) this option to whichever Video codec you are using (in the "one pass", "first pass", and "second pass" sections):
<pre>
-vf pullup,softskip,pp=lb,crop=$CROPWIDTH:$CROPHEIGHT:$CROPLEFT:$CROPTOP,scale=$WIDTH:$HEIGHT,dsize=$ASPECT,harddup
</pre>
