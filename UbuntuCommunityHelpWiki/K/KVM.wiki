== Introduction ==

Ubuntu uses <nowiki>[[http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page|KVM]]</nowiki> as the back-end virtualization technology ''primarily for non-graphic servers'' and <nowiki>[[http://libvirt.org/|libvirt]]</nowiki> as its toolkit/API.  Libvirt front ends for managing VMs include <nowiki>[[http://virt-manager.et.redhat.com/|virt-manager]]</nowiki> (GUI) or virsh (CLI).

== Documentation ==

* <nowiki>[[Installation|Installation]]</nowiki> - Installation and removal of KVM
* <nowiki>[[Networking|Networking]]</nowiki> - Network configuration; includes bridging
* <nowiki>[[CreateGuests|Guest Creation]]</nowiki> - Creation of different kinds of guests
* <nowiki>[[Managing|Guest Management]]</nowiki> - Management of guests; command line or graphically
* <nowiki>[[Access|Guest Console Access]]</nowiki> Direct access to the guest via the serial console
* <nowiki>[[Directly|KVM Directly]]</nowiki> - Using KVM directly (without libvirt)

== Notes ==

* '''Also check out the official docs, https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/virtualization-introduction'''

* '''The use case targeted when KVM was moved into main is '''"server virtualization"'''.  This means that even though KVM can be used to serve other purposes, it has been designed to be run on Ubuntu Server Edition to host non-graphical server operating systems.  If you are looking for software to serve graphically-based virtual machines, VirtualBox, Parallels Workstation (or Parallels Desktop for Mac), or VMware Player/Server are more suitable alternatives.'''
