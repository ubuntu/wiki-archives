This document provides instructions and notes on upgrading to Ubuntu 9.04 (code name "Jaunty Jackalope"), released on the 23rd of April 2009. 

== Before You Start ==

* You can only directly upgrade to Ubuntu 9.04 from Ubuntu 8.10 (see UpgradeNotes).
* Be sure that you have all updates applied to Ubuntu 8.10 before you upgrade.
* Before upgrading it is recommended that you read the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/904|release notes]]</nowiki> for Ubuntu 9.04, which document caveats and workarounds for known issues in this version.

If you have a version of Ubuntu which was released ''before'' Ubuntu 8.10, please see <nowiki>[[UpgradeNotes]]</nowiki> for information on how to upgrade.

== Network Upgrade for Ubuntu Desktops (Recommended) ==
You can easily upgrade over the network with the following procedure.

1. Start System/Administration/Update Manager.  (If you do not see "Update Manager" in the list, launch the Synaptic Package Manager and install the "update-manager" package.)
    <nowiki>[[File:jaunty_upgrade2.5.png||width=623 height=556]]</nowiki>
# Click the '''Check''' button to check for new updates.
# If there are any updates to install, use the '''Install Updates''' button to install them, and press '''Check''' again after that is complete.
# A message will appear informing you of the availability of the new release.
  <nowiki>[[File:um2.jpg]]</nowiki>
# Click '''Upgrade'''.
# Follow the on-screen instructions.

=== Network Upgrade for Kubuntu Desktops (Recommended) ===

'''To upgrade from 8.10 to Kubuntu 9.04''', over the Internet, use the following procedure.

# Click on the update notifier icon when it prompts that a new version is available, or press '''alt-F2''' and run '''update-notifier-kde -u'''.
# Follow the prompts

For full details on upgrading from 8.10 see <nowiki>[[JauntyUpgrades-Kubuntu]]</nowiki>.

'''To upgrade from 8.04 to Kubuntu 9.04''', over the Internet, use the following procedure.

# Ensure your system is up to date with Adept Updater
# Run Adept Manager
# Click Fetch Updates
# The Version Upgrade button will appear, click it.

For full details on upgrading from 8.04 see <nowiki>[[JauntyUpgrades-Kubuntu-8.04]]</nowiki>.

=== Network Upgrade for Ubuntu Servers (Recommended) ===

1. Install `update-manager-core` if it is not already installed: <pre>
sudo apt-get install update-manager-core
</pre>
1. Launch the upgrade tool: <pre>
sudo do-release-upgrade
</pre>
1. Follow the on-screen instructions.

== Upgrading Using the Alternate CD/DVD ==

Use this method if the system being upgraded is not connected to the Internet.

# Download the '''alternate''' installation CD
# <nowiki>[[BurningIsoHowto#InUbuntu|Burn the ISO to a CD]]</nowiki> and insert it into the CD-ROM drive of the computer to be upgraded.
** If the ISO file is on the computer to be upgraded, you could avoid wasting a CD by <nowiki>[[ManageDiscImages#MountISOFiles|mounting the ISO as a drive]]</nowiki> with a command like: <pre>
sudo mount -o loop ~/Desktop/ubuntu-9.04-alternate-i386.iso /media/cdrom0
</pre>
# A dialog will be displayed offering you the opportunity to upgrade using that CD.
# Follow the on-screen instructions.

If the upgrade dialog is not displayed for any reason, you may also run the following command using `Alt+F2`: <pre>
gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"
</pre>

Or in Kubuntu run the following command using `Alt+F2`: <pre>
kdesudo "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"
</pre>

== Upgrading from a Torrent ==

If you're familiar with <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)|torrents]]</nowiki> and have an ISP that doesn't limit them, you can download the upgrade much more quickly.  You'll also be sharing your bandwidth with other Ubuntu users and helping to reduce the load on the servers, which is especially beneficial on release days when the server overload causes problems.

Just visit http://releases.ubuntu.com/jaunty/, and download the appropriate torrent file for the '''alternate''' installation CD, found in the list towards the bottom of the page.  (It will have a filename like ''ubuntu-9.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent''.)  Load it into your BitTorrent client, and after it is done downloading the ISO, follow the <nowiki>[[#AlternateUpgrade|alternate CD upgrade instructions]]</nowiki>.
