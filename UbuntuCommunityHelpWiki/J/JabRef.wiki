JabRef is in the Universe repository for Ubuntu Hardy, Intrepid and Jaunty, and can be installed using the package manager: System &rarr; Administration &rarr; Synaptic Package Manager.

You may need to enable the Universe repository see the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu | RepositoriesUbuntu ]]</nowiki> page for instruction on how to do this.

JabRef can be started from Application &rarr; Office &rarr; JabRef.

== Adding & Editing References ==

Before adding references create a new database using the File &rarr; Open Database or open an existing BibTeX file using the New &rarr; Open Database menu option.

JabRef provides a number of ways to add references:

# BibTeX &rarr; New entry menu option will allow a new reference type to selected and added.
# BibTeX &rarr; New entry from plain text menu option will open a window into which a plain text BibTeX reference can be inserted.
# An existing BibTeX file can be added into an existing or new database using the File &rarr; Import into New database or File &rarr; Import into current database menu options.
 

References can be edited by:

# Selecting BibTeX &rarr; Edit entry.
# Selecting an entry and pressing Ctrl + E.
# Double clicking on an entry.

== Hints and Tips ==

A file can be linked to a reference using the file field in the General tab when editing an entry. A linked file can be opened from within JabRef by right clicking the file field and selecting Open or selecting the entry and pressing F4.

A reference key can be copied by selecting a reference and pressing Ctrl + K.

If you use Lyx or Kile to edit <nowiki>[[LaTeX]]</nowiki> documents you can transfer a reference to these editors by pressing the button towards the right of the toolbar with the Lyx logo.
