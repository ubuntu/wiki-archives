__TOC__

A standalone Edubuntu system needs at least:
* 500 Mhz processor
* 256 MB of RAM
* 3 GB of hard disk space

Exceeding the minimums is always okay. :)  For example, if you have a lot of user data, such as a large music or digital photo collection, that you would like you keep on your hard disk, you will need a bigger hard disk.
