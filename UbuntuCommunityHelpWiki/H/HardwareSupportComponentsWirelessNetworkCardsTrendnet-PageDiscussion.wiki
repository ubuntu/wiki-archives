__TOC__

AFAICT, the TEW-423PI does ''not'' work out of the box on 10.04.  Googling seems to suggest the need for proprietary drivers or ndiswrapper.

Some more information can be found at <nowiki>[[http://gajon.org/installing-realtek-rtl8185-wireless-card/|here, for slackware, rtl-8185 chipset in general]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-wireless-networking-41/trendnet-tew423i-chip-rtl8185-linux-driver-found-618630/|here for tew-423pi, not ubuntu-specific]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1015057|Account of woes on Ubuntu]]</nowiki>

As someone who bought a TEW-423PI on the strength of this page's recommendations, I'd ''really'' like to see the claim that it works out of the box either removed or a pointer added to information that supports that claim.
