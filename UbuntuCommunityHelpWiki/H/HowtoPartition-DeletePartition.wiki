== Deleting A Partition ==
 If you have a partition which you don't need anymore, the easiest way possible to create more space in which to install Ubuntu or expand an existing one is to delete that partition.  This potentially creates a large amount of free space in which to create your Linux filesystem, depending on the size of the partition that you are deleting.
 
 <!>  Of course, the usual caveat applies - back up any files or data that you wish to preserve to another partition or removable media before you delete the partition.  Once deleted, the data will be difficult, if not impossible, to recover.
 
To delete a partition, right click on the partition that you wish to delete and select "Delete" from the menu.  Once you are sure that you've selected the correct partition, and are positive that you have backed up all the files or data that you wish to save from that partition, click the "Apply" button at the top of the Window, and the partition will be deleted.
