* Model - This is the full device model as noted on the box.
* Chipset - Chipset vendor name, chipset name, vendor code, and device code. For example, if one was looking for a PCI device: <pre>
lspci -vvnn | grep Network
04:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter [10ec:8176] (rev 01)
</pre> It's the ''''Realtek'''', ''''RTL8188CE'''', and ''''[10ec:8176] (rev 01)''''.
* Driver - For a PCI device: <pre>
lspci -vvnn | grep -A 9 Network | grep Kernel
	Kernel driver in use: rtl8192ce
</pre> It's the ''''rtl8192ce''''.
* Works "out of the box"
** Yes - It works perfectly with no manual modifications, or degraded performance.
** No - It doesn't work at all, has degraded performance, or requires manual configuration to make it work. Please add a comment to what you had to do to get it to work if this was possible, as well as a URL to an outstanding Launchpad bug report to address the issues encountered.

| Yes
| Get the atmel wireless drivers from synaptic (atmelwlandriver-source) if you are having problems. The retractable Xjack antenna makes it worth having! Seems to work fine with Edgy, even VPN (Cisco 3000) and WPA (wpa_supplicant) seem to be no Problem

| Yes
| Works out of the box on 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) - also with WPA and signal strength detection (install linux-restricted-modules for your kernel if it isn't detected - it uses the madwifi driver).
