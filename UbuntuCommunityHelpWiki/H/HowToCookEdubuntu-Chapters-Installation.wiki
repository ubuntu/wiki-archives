== Getting Started with Edubuntu 6.06 ==
=== Welcome ===

This guide will attempt to explain the basics in setting up a thin client computer lab using Edubuntu. You should also be able to use it for other kinds of setups, as alternative options will be touched briefly as well. We will cover the installation of Edubuntu, and some basic administration.

For more information on free software, please refer to the Free Software Foundation website.

=== Installation ===

When the CD starts up, you will be greeted by a friendly options screen.

<nowiki>[[File:cdboot.png]]</nowiki>

*** "Install to hard disk", will install a terminal server. Use this option if you'd like to boot from diskless thin clients into this machine. Note that a terminal server requires at least 150MB RAM per client that will be logging into this server. The server will also need a powerful CPU, such as an Intel Xeon processor. To install a terminal server, simply press ENTER here.
*** "Install a workstion", will install a single workstation. This is essentially the same as the first option, except that it doesn't include the terminal server setup, or any other server side software (such as Schooltool). Use the arrow keys to navigate one level down, and press ENTER.
*** "Check CD for defects" will scan the installation CD for any defects that might have been caused during downloading or burning the CD. It's advised that you do this first before continuing with the installation.
*** "Rescue a broken system" contains tools for fixing your Edubuntu system when things go wrong.
*** "Boot from first hard disk" allows you to boot to your hard disk, useful when you've accidentally booted from the CD.

If you need to change any of the default settings, such as language or display settings, you can do this by pressing the appropriate function key as listed on the bottem of the screen. Once your options are set, choose the installation option you would like to persue. The Edubuntu installer will then start, you should see some text messages flash by for a second or two. You will then be greeted by the language selection screen:

<nowiki>[[File:language.png]]</nowiki>

Select your language with the arrow keys, and press ENTER. Then, choose your location:

<nowiki>[[File:location.png]]</nowiki>

Choose your keyboard layout. Note that this is different to your language selection.

Edubuntu installer will now detect your hardware, and then prompt you for an I.P. (Internet Protocol) address. This address identifies your computer on the network. If you're installing a terminal server, and you are unsure what to enter here, use "192.168.0.254". If it's a workstation setup, ask your network administrator for your network details.

<nowiki>[[File:network-ip.png]]</nowiki>

Next, you need to enter the netmask. This should generally be "255.255.255.0".

<nowiki>[[File:netmask.png]]</nowiki>

Next, choose the default gateway. If you don't currently have one, use the same address you used for your server IP address:

<nowiki>[[File:gateway.png]]</nowiki>

The same applies to the nameserver address:

<nowiki>[[File:nameserver.png]]</nowiki>

Next, enter your proxy server address. If you don't have a proxy server, leave this field blank by simply pressing ENTER.

The next step is partitioning. This is where you choose how much of your disk space you would like to assign to Edubuntu. If you'd like to use your entire disk, simple choose the option that contains "Erase Entire Disk". The Edubuntu installer will then automatically calculate your partitions. If you currently have another operating system installed, the installer will also provide you with an option to resize your current system, making space for the Edubuntu system.

<nowiki>[[File:partition.png]]</nowiki>

Next, confirm that the partitioning by choosing "Yes":

You will then be prompted to enter information for the first user that will be added to the system. This user will have administrator rights to the system. If this installation is a terminal server setup, it's advised to keep the administrator name generic, such as "Lab Administrator". If it's your home Edubuntu system, you could choose your own, real name, such as "Arthur Dent".

<nowiki>[[File:fullname.png]]</nowiki>

Next, enter a username for this user. This must be a single word, containing only lowercase letters and no spaces, such as "admin" or "sysadmin" or "arthur" or "adent".

<nowiki>[[File:username.png]]</nowiki>

Enter a password for the user. Avoid using weak passwords such as "admin" or "password", or any other words you might find in a dictionary. Also avoid simple passwords or patterns on your keyboard. A strong password contains lots of mixed alphanumeric characters, such as "l8eM5piiMr2" or "pt0-3f!steE".

<nowiki>[[File:password.png]]</nowiki>

You will need to confirm the password by typing it again in the password confirmation dialog. Following that, the Edubuntu installer will start installing the base system. From here on, the installer will do most of the work. This is the part where you can make some coffee, sit back, and relax.

If you also watch the package extraction (which is a bit like watching paint dry), and if you chose to install a terminal server, you will also notice it building the "LTSP chroot". This is another Linux system that will be installed within Edubuntu. This is the system that the thin clients will boot from, which we will often refer to as the "thin client environment" or the "LTSP chroot".

The installer will now require some user input again. Select the resolutions that your display / card is capable of. If you're unsure, simply press ENTER, the installer should detect the correct capabilities of your hardware.

The installer will then complete the Edubuntu installation, and you will be prompted to reboot. Remove the Edubuntu CD-ROM and press ENTER to reboot.

Congratulations, the Edubuntu installation will now be complete, and you should be able to boot into your system.
