| This wireless card does not work in Karmic. (iwlagn expects firmware/ucode version 3 or lower, but 4 is the only version available). Installing linux-backports-modules-karmic fixes this. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/496496|BugLink]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[http://www.linux-archive.org/ubuntu-kernel-team/295421-fix-iwl6000-does-not-work-2-6-31-kernel.html|linux-archive.org thread]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[http://tehfade.blogspot.com/2010/01/thinkpad-t410.html|Blog post detailing fix]]</nowiki>.
