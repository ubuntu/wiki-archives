Starting in Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), the '''pcspkr''' kernel module is blacklisted by default.  See <nowiki>[[Bug:77010|this Launchpad bug report]]</nowiki>.

== Disabling the System Bell ==
You know that beep you get when press the wrong key in xterm?  Well here is a mini-howto to get rid of the beep (system bell) if it annoys you.

=== KDE Notifications ===
In KDE the system bell can be turned off or on by:
K Menu > System > System Settings

=== System-wide ===
You can stop the PC speaker from beeping by removing the PC speaker kernel module.  To do so run the following command in a terminal:

<pre>
sudo rmmod pcspkr
</pre>

A more permanent way is to disable the loading of the PC speaker kernel module.  Add the following line to your '''/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf''' file, to blacklist and stop the module for loading at boot:

<pre>
blacklist pcspkr 
</pre>

To re-enable the bell, comment the blacklist line with a # symbol:
<pre>
</pre>
