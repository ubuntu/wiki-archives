== Summary ==

* Model - This is the full device model as noted on the box.
* Chipset - Chipset vendor name, chipset name, vendor code, and device code. For example, if one was looking for a PCI device: <pre>
lspci -vvnn | grep Network
04:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter [10ec:8176] (rev 01)
</pre> It's the ''''Realtek'''', ''''RTL8188CE'''', and ''''[10ec:8176] (rev 01)''''.
* Driver - For a PCI device: <pre>
lspci -vvnn | grep -A 9 Network | grep Kernel
	Kernel driver in use: rtl8192ce
</pre> It's the ''''rtl8192ce''''.
* Works "out of the box"
** Yes - It works perfectly with no manual modifications, or degraded performance.
** No - It doesn't work at all, has degraded performance, or requires manual configuration to make it work. Please add a comment to what you had to do to get it to work if this was possible, as well as a URL to an outstanding Launchpad bug report to address the issues encountered.

| rt61pci
| No
| Card has intermittent "lag spikes" every 10 seconds. It's only a problem if you are using latency intensive applications (i.e. online games). Restricting data rate to 9 Mbps will fix the issue. This is hardware related as I have the same problem in WinXP. Tested w/ WPA security.

| Gutsy: Works in unencrypted, WEP and WPA2 modes. For WPA/PSK, use the original Ralink driver together with their wpa-supplicant patch; also, don't expect it will work with automatic configuration.

| Tested with 10.10. Had to compile the Ralink drivers for RT3062 and blacklist the rt2800 and rt2x00 modules. Running WPA & WPA2 encryption without problems. Note that <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1806897|this post]]</nowiki> has the solution with prepared drivers to download and install, running on Kubuntu 11.10.

"make" (ignore /tftpboot error), then "sudo make install DAT_PATH=/etc/Wireless/RT2870STA DAT_FILE_NAME=RT2870STA.dat" (2870 filename is hard-coded in driver). Add "blacklist rt2800usb" and "blacklist rt2870sta" to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and reboot.

| 8192cu?
| ?
| No
| To make work with 10.10 First sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic, then download the driver from: http://www.edimax.com/, then extract the folder named rtl8192CU from under driver to Desktop/rtl8192CUdriverfolder... then in a Terminal: make, sudo make install, sudo modprobe 8192cu. You may need to replug the USB adapter. After a new kernel or linux-image do as follows: cd Desktop/rtl8192CUdriverfolder... make clean, make, sudo make install, sudo modprobe 8192cu.  To make work with '''11.04''' do the following in addition to the above, replace init_MUTEX(prwlock) in os_dep/osdep_service.c with a sema_init(prwlock,1)
