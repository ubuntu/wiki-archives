* Driver - For a PCI device: <pre>
lspci -vvnn | grep -A 9 Network | grep Kernel
	Kernel driver in use: rtl8192ce
</pre> It's the ''''rtl8192ce''''.
* Works "out of the box"
** Yes - It works perfectly with no manual modifications, or degraded performance.
** No - It doesn't work at all, has degraded performance, or requires manual configuration to make it work. Please add a comment to what you had to do to get it to work if this was possible, as well as a URL to an outstanding Launchpad bug report to address the issues encountered.

| On Ubuntu 14.10 worked out of the box for about 5 minutes, then stalled (as in pages wouldn't load and eventually gave a DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET error on Google Chrome).  Rebooted and again worked for 5 minutes then stalled. After much searching I followed instructions at https://github.com/pvaret/rtl8192cu-fixes/blob/master/README.md and it finally worked.  It's worth noting I only got this as I thought, reading other experiences, this would work out of the box; however I believe that there has been a change on Version 3 of the TL-WN822N meaning it has issues.  Last time I buy TP-Link.
