This article was originally written/created by the MoinMoin developers.  When creating a page, the Ubuntu Documentation/Wiki Team prefers that you use the documentation located on <nowiki>[[WikiGuide-PageCreation]]</nowiki>].  Documentation from this article has been integrated into that page.  For this reason, you were redirected there.

== How to create a new page ==

You create a new page by visiting the page. If the page does not exists, Moin``Moin will suggest to create it. There are several ways to create a new page:

=== By Adding a link on another page ===
# Edit another page
# Add a link to the new page, either as a WikiName or as `<nowiki>[[Name With Spaces]]</nowiki>`
# Save the page and click the new link
# Click one of the template names
# Edit your new page and save it

For more information on linking to other pages, see HelpOnLinking.

=== By visiting the page ===

# Enter the address of the new page, e.g `http://example.com/wiki/MyNewPage` in the browser location box and press Enter
# Click one of the template names
# Edit your new page and save it

 (!) Might not work on all browsers if the page name contains non ASCII characters.

=== By using the NewPage macro ===

If the current page uses the `NewPage` macro:
# Enter the page name in the text box and click ""
# Edit your page and save it

Example:
 
The `NewPage` macro makes it easy to create new pages in one step by using certain templates or automatically creating a sub page. For more help on the `NewPage` macro, see HelpOnMacros.

=== By using the GoTo macro ===

If the current page uses the `GoTo` macro:
# Enter the page name in the text box and click ""
# Click "Create new page"
# Edit your page and save it

Example:
 <<GoTo>>
