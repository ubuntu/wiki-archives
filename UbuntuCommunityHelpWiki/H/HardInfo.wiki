== Installation ==
* <nowiki>[[apt:hardinfo|Install the ''hardinfo'' package]]</nowiki>

== Usage ==

=== Launch Application ===
Once installed, HardInfo can be launched from 'System Tools > System Profiler and Benchmark'. Alternatively the application can be launched from the command line using the following:

<code>$ hardinfo </code>

=== Network Update ===
NOTE: Network Update is <nowiki>[[https://github.com/lpereira/hardinfo/issues/18| unavailable until further notice]]</nowiki> due to loss of database hosting.

Until a network update is completed, only the results of local tests can be viewed under the 'Benchmarks' section. Completing a network update from 'Information > Network Updater..' will download additional benchmarks for comparison and against the local machine. Benchmark results will then appear ranked from best performing to lowest performing against other systems.

=== Benchmarks ===
HardInfo comes with the following benchmark tests:
* CPU Blowfish
* CPU !CryptoHash
* CPU Fibonacci
* CPU N-Queens
* FPU FFT
* FPU Raytracing

Highlighting any test and then selecting 'refresh' from the top toolbar will rerun any previously completed benchmarks

=== Generate Reports ===
Simply select 'Generate Report' from the top toolbar, a dialogue box will appear allowing you to export all desired computer, device, network or benchmark results to a HTML file. Upon completion an option to open the file immediately for viewing is provided
