=== About the book ===

Hello there. It has been many summers since one of our volunteers first suggested writing the Edubuntu cookbook.  We hoped to create a guide that is as enjoyable to read and use as it has been to write.  Here you see the result of tremendous effort of the edubuntu cookbook team: a guide that will take you through the basics of installing and using Edubuntu.  This book is far from finished, but we hope to improve it as the time passes.

Kind regards,
The writers.
