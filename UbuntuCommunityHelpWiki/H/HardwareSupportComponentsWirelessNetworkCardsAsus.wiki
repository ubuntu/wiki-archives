| RT2500
| ?
| No
| Tested in 7.10. Gives errors in dmesg but once I clicked on the nm-applet and selected Manual Configuration, I was able to put in my SSID, etc. I also had to enter DNS info manually. Then I just had to run ifdown wlan0 && ifup wlan0 and I was online. Worked for me with a Linksys router running DD-WRT and WPA-TKIP.

| Using 8.04 works fine out of the box! If you have any issue (e.g. slow connection) try to install '''linux-backports-modules-hardy''' (For older version of Ubuntu you must instal GPL RT73 driver. Follow the instructions at the bottom of this guide <nowiki>[[WifiDocs-Driver-RalinkRT73]]</nowiki>).
