== Summary ==

* Model - This is the full device model as noted on the box.
* Chipset - Chipset vendor name, chipset name, vendor code, and device code. For example, if one was looking for a PCI device: <pre>
lspci -vvnn | grep Network
04:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter [10ec:8176] (rev 01)
</pre> It's the ''''Realtek'''', ''''RTL8188CE'''', and ''''[10ec:8176] (rev 01)''''.
* Driver - For a PCI device: <pre>
lspci -vvnn | grep -A 9 Network | grep Kernel
	Kernel driver in use: rtl8192ce
</pre> It's the ''''rtl8192ce''''.
* Works "out of the box"
** Yes - It works perfectly with no manual modifications, or degraded performance.
** No - It doesn't work at all, has degraded performance, or requires manual configuration to make it work. Please add a comment to what you had to do to get it to work if this was possible, as well as a URL to an outstanding Launchpad bug report to address the issues encountered.

== Note on D-Link USB modules ==

A response from D-Link costumer support on which USB modules they support on Linux;

'''2016-10-19 16:54:00 10000941 GMT+1 

120 Unassigned/New 200 Waiting for Customer 

You have DWA-181(up to kernel 3.10) or DWA-131, but there's no official support for this system. That's why drives which you can get are for the old kernels and haven't been updated then.

Regards, 
D-Link Technical Support'''

So no official drivers exists for any D-Link USB modules after kernel-3.10.

Added_note: I confirm this card does not work with a default Hoary install: despite the fact that it worked fine with my Hoary install from Array 5. The fault seems to be related to an error in loading the firmware which is present in the hotplug firmware folder.
