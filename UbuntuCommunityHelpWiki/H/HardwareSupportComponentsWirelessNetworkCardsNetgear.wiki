== Summary ==

* Model - This is the full device model as noted on the box.
* Chipset - Chipset vendor name, chipset name, vendor code, and device code. For example, if one was looking for a PCI device: <pre>
lspci -vvnn | grep Network
04:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter [10ec:8176] (rev 01)
</pre> It's the ''''Realtek'''', ''''RTL8188CE'''', and ''''[10ec:8176] (rev 01)''''.
* Driver - For a PCI device: <pre>
lspci -vvnn | grep -A 9 Network | grep Kernel
	Kernel driver in use: rtl8192ce
</pre> It's the ''''rtl8192ce''''.
* Works "out of the box"
** Yes - It works perfectly with no manual modifications, or degraded performance.
** No - It doesn't work at all, has degraded performance, or requires manual configuration to make it work. Please add a comment to what you had to do to get it to work if this was possible, as well as a URL to an outstanding Launchpad bug report to address the issues encountered.

| MA401RA
| ?
| orinoco or hostap
| No
| The MA401RA use the orinoco or the hostap drivers. To avoid a complete freeze of the system when the card is inserted, you may have to include a line "exclude=irq3" in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts.  Once done, everything works well.  In Dapper, if you want to use (k)networkmanager, you may want to use the hostap driver instead of the orinoco one.  See this <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=169222&highlight=knetworkmanager|thread]]</nowiki>.

| MA401RA Eval-RevA
| ?
| orinoco_cs or hostap_cs
| No
| Works with orinoco_cs, but works better with hostap_cs (ie network manager works. See this <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=169222&highlight=knetworkmanager|thread]]</nowiki> for details). Make sure to add to /etc/pcmcia/config.opts 'exclude irq 3', 'exclude irq 4', and 'exclude irq 7'.

|-
| MA401(RA) Rev.D
| ?
| orinoco_cs
| No
| The card will be recognized by the system and all seems ok, but there is no chance to get an IP address via DHCP or any other network communication (no matter with or without encryption). There is no label on the card that it is MA401RA, but the system says it is one. It can't be the same card as described above, because hostap doesn't work at all. Accesspoint used is Trendnet TEW-310APB; card is used in a Laptop Asus A1000
