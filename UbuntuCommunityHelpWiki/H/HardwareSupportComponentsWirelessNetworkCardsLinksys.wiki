| Get recognized in the setup process, but unable to use it. After setup completes, the card is shown in the network interfaces (as eth0, all hardware details are shown too), but the system is unable to activate it. Updating the firmware (link broken) fixes the problem. To do this when Ubuntu starts, open the restricted drivers management and enable bcm43xx.

| Couldn't get any of the windows drivers from linksys.com to work (they don't have a version 3 one listed right now) but I tried the driver off the installation CD with ndiswrapper and it worked. Built in driver works flawlessly with the 2.6.15 kernel. In Feisty installing Broadcom firmware <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/LinksysWPC54GS-UK|here]]</nowiki> will get v.3 cards working.

| Hardware recognized immediately upon startup. Clicking through warnings re: closed-source/proprietary hardware should bring you options to download firmware updates. Following downloads and install, you should be up and running (note: you may also need to manually configure the network - enter SSID, WEP, DHCP setup or not, etc.)

| WUSB600N Ver. 1
| Ralink RT2870
| rt2870usb
| No
| version1: Needed to modify the Ralink driver or simply use the modified-for-you version available at this post:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=972060 . Following the instructions at that post enabled the adapter and it works perfectly. Basically the problem is although the adapter uses the RT2870 chipset, the Ralink drivers don't know it yet, so you have to add the name of the adapter and change a few variables to support WPA (the original Ralink driver's README gives instructions on the WPA stuff). The pre-configured driver package in that post has done this already.

| On 64 bit system, native support with brcmfmac for this chipset did not work. Using ndiswrapper, could not load .inf file from the XP driver without adding some entries, and even then at a moderate distance from the router the connection was dropped so frequently as to be unusable; could not register an IP address.
