| Driver available from Realtek's site, but must be compiled by user (instructions included). Alternatively, there is a PPA available <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~lexical/+archive/hwe-wireless|here]]</nowiki> with a precompiled driver, eliminating the need to recompile after every update.

| Works out of the box most of the time, but causes hangs in hibernate/restore unless the driver is removed and re-installed. Connects most of the time on a cold boot, but often won't reconnect after hibernate until drivers are removed and re-inserted again. Doesn't work with ndiswrapper.
