== Introduction ==
This document provides instructions and notes on upgrading to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy Heron), released on the 24th of April 2008. 

=== Before You Start ===

* You can  directly upgrade to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS ("Hardy Heron") from Ubuntu 7.10 ("Gutsy Gibbon") or from Ubuntu 6.06 LTS ("Dapper Drake"). This page contains instructions for both. (see UpgradeNotes)
* Be sure that you have all updates applied to your current version of Ubuntu before you upgrade.
* Before upgrading it is recommended that you read the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/804|release notes]]</nowiki> for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, which document caveats and workarounds for known issues in this version.

If you have a version of Ubuntu other than 6.06 LTS or 7.10, please see <nowiki>[[UpgradeNotes]]</nowiki> for information on how to upgrade.

=== Upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 LTS ===

==== Known Problems ====
1. The upgrade will freeze on the `locales` package if you are using the (current) Gutsy kernel, 2.6.22-15. Reboot into 2.6.22-14 before upgrading. See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/249340| the bug report on Launchpad]]</nowiki> for full details.

=== Upgrade from 6.06 LTS to 8.04 LTS ===
This section describes how to perform 6.06 LTS ("Dapper") -> 8.04 LTS ("Hardy") upgrades.

==== Network Upgrade from 6.06 for Ubuntu Desktops (Recommended) ====
# Make sure the "dapper-updates" software channel is enabled.
# Be sure that you have all updates applied before you upgrade.
# Press Alt-F2 and type <code>gksu "update-manager"</code>
  <nowiki>[[File:update_manager_01.png]]</nowiki>
# Click the '''Check''' button to check for new updates.
# A message will appear informing you of the availability of the new release.

  <nowiki>[[File:update-manager-upgrade-804.png]]</nowiki>
# Click '''Upgrade'''.
# Follow the on-screen instructions.

==== Network Upgrade from 6.06 for Kubuntu Desktops (Recommended) ====

'''To upgrade from Kubuntu 6.06 to 8.04''' over the Internet you can use a special mode in the server upgrade system.

# Enable the "dapper-updates" repository.
# Install the new "update-manager-core" package - dependencies include python-apt, python-gnupginterface and python2.4-apt.
# Run "sudo do-release-upgrade -m desktop" in a terminal window.
# Follow the steps on the terminal window.

==== Network Upgrade from 6.06 for Ubuntu Servers (Recommended) ====
If you run an Ubuntu server, you should use the new server upgrade system.

# Enable the "dapper-updates" repository.
# Install the new "update-manager-core" package - dependencies include python-apt, python-gnupginterface and python2.4-apt.
# Run "sudo do-release-upgrade" in a terminal window.
# Follow the steps on the terminal window.

=== Upgrading Using the Alternate CD/DVD ===

Use this method if the system being upgraded is not connected to the Internet.

# Download and burn the '''alternate''' installation CD.
# Insert it into your CD-ROM drive.
# A dialog will be displayed offering you the opportunity to upgrade using that CD.
# Follow the on-screen instructions.

If the upgrade dialog is not displayed for any reason, you may also run the following command using `Alt+F2`: <pre>
gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"
</pre>

Or in Kubuntu run the following command using `Alt+F2`: <pre>
kdesu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"
</pre>

=== Upgrading from a Torrent ===

If you're familiar with torrents and have an ISP that doesn't limit them, you can download the upgrade much more quickly.  You'll also be sharing your bandwidth with other Ubuntu users and helping to reduce the load on the servers, which is especially useful on release days when the server overload causes problems.  Basic instructions:

# Download the ISO file for the alternate installation CD using the ''.torrent'' file found on http://releases.ubuntu.com
# Mount the ISO as a drive or burn it to a physical CD
# Follow the alternate CD upgrade instructions

=== Troubleshooting ===

==== Unexpected reboot hangs on boot ====

My experience is based on Xubuntu 6.06 to Xubuntu 8.04 but I think it is the same for Ubuntu. My update stopped suddenly and after reboot Linux kernel did boot but get hung on the process boot. Here there is how I fixed it:
# Boot with Ubuntu 6.06 disk (in my case Alternate)
# Select: Repair a Broken system
# Select: Open a Rescue Shell.
# Select: Root Partition for Ubuntu.
# Run: dpkg --configure -a
# Whenever the process is finished: exit.
# Boot again into your system (now it should work)
# Run dpkg --configure -a as root from a terminal (Ctrl+alt+f1)
# System should be updated.
