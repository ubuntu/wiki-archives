== Popular virtual machine applications ==
This section lists the most commonly-used virtual machine applications which support Ubuntu.

=== Xen ===
'''Xen''' is a popular, open-source virtual machine application that is officially supported by Ubuntu. It provides high performance, but only supports a small number of host and guest operating systems. Ubuntu is supported as both a host and guest operating system, and Xen is available in the <code>universe</code> software channel.

* <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen|Xen]]</nowiki> - instructions on getting Xen up and running on Ubuntu

=== VirtualBox ===
* <nowiki>[[VirtualBox]]</nowiki> - Open-source virtual machine from Oracle. Easy to install and use and not to mention very popular.

=== VMWare ===
'''VMware''' is a non-free virtual machine application, which supports Ubuntu as both a host and guest operating system. Several versions of VMware are available at no cost and can be installed on Ubuntu. One, <code>vmware-player</code>, is available from the <code>multiverse</code> software channel in Ubuntu. VMWare is the virtual machine solution that has been in use the longest and is the most widely used.

=== Qemu ===
'''Qemu''' is a ''processor emulator'' and virtual machine. Qemu supports Ubuntu as both a host and guest operating system, and is capable of emulating ''arm'', ''powerpc'', ''sparc'' and ''x86'' processors. Qemu is available from the <code>universe</code> software channel in Ubuntu as the package <code>qemu</code>.
