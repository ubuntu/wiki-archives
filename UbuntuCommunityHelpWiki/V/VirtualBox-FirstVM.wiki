=== Install Guest Additions ===

For any serious and interactive use, the VirtualBox Guest Additions will make your life much easier by providing closer integration between host and guest and improving the interactive performance of guest systems. Among other things, it include seamless windows, shared folders, automatic mouse capture and clipboard sharing among host and guest machines.

The Guest Additions are designed to be installed inside a virtual machine after the guest operating system has been installed. They consist of device drivers and system applications that optimize the guest operating system for better performance and usability.
