vt.handoff (vt = virtualterminal) is a kernel boot parameter unique to Ubuntu, and is not an upstream kernel boot parameter. Its purpose is to allow the kernel to maintain the current contents of video memory on a virtual terminal. So, when the operating system is booting up, when it moves past the boot loader, vt.handoff allows showing of an aubergine background, with Plymouth displaying a logo and progress indicator bar on top of this. Once the display manager comes up, it smoothly replaces this with a login prompt.
