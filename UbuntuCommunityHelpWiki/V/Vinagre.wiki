== Introduction ==

Remote Desktop Viewer (Vinagre) is the default VNC client in Ubuntu 8.04. It currently allows you to connect to desktops running VNC servers and control them. Specific connection options are not currently supported, e.g. high or low bandwidth settings, but it is planned to add them in an upcoming version.

=== Usage ===
Applications > Internet > Remote Desktop Viewer <<BR>>
Or press Alt+F2 and type <code>vinagre</code>.

To connect to a machine manually, enter it's name into the Connect dialog. From here you can also search the local network for available machines.
You can connect to a machine automatically using a .vnc file – just go to Machines > Open.

* Multiple connections can be made, each one has its own tab.
* Passwords for connections can be remembered.
* Connections can be bookmarked.
* Fullscreen is turned on/off by pressing F11.
* You can save screenshots of the current connection.

==== Planned Features ====
* Specific options for individual connections, e.g. color depth, compression level, refresh rate.

=== Alternatives ===
Vinagre is not currently well suited for low speed networks, as it always connects in a high speed mode. Another default application, <nowiki>[[tsclient|Terminal Server Client]]</nowiki>, may be a better solution for you. It requires the <code>xvnc4viewer</code> package to be installed in order to connect with VNC.
