== Introduction ==

How to install and use the live video editing application veejay on Intrepid This package currently needs to be compiled. It took me a while so I documented what I did. Some parts come from the tarball and some from SVN. This may look complicated but it is actually fairly easy to cut and paste the following commands into a terminal.

== About Veejay ==

Veejay is a 'visual' instrument and realtime video sampler for live video performances. Allows you to trigger samples, apply realtime effects (120+), scratch, mix, record.
 
Veejay is a visual instrument and real-time video sampler. It allows you to "play" the video like you would play a piano. While playing, you can record the resulting video directly to disk (video sampling). 

The graphical user interface is known as 'reloaded'
