== Enable NumLock during startup ==

Enabling Numlock on startup can be done of several different ways.  First install '''numlockx''':

<pre>
sudo apt-get install numlockx
</pre>

=== Place command with init scripts ===

<pre>
sudo sed -i 's|^exit 0.*$|# Numlock enable\n[ -x /usr/bin/numlockx ] \&\& numlockx on\n\nexit 0|' /etc/rc.local
</pre>

=== Enabling NumLock from startx ===

If you are not using a graphical display manager then add the following line to '''/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc'''
<pre>
/usr/bin/numlockx on
</pre>

=== Enabling NumLock from lightdm configuration ===

In '''Ubuntu 14.04''' the above methods of running numlockx don't work. It can be run by changing configuration of '''LightDM''' display manager. Edit '''/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-unity-greeter.conf''' file and add the following line at the end:
<pre>
greeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/numlockx on
</pre>
This defines running numlockx command when starting the Unity Greeter.
(See more info in '''/usr/share/doc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.gz''').

=== Enabling NumLock for Virtual Consoles (TTYs) ===

If you use the virtual consoles regularly, then you will quite likely want to have numlock on for the TTYs after boot up.  The status of numlock/scroll-lock/capslock can be manipulated with the '''setleds''' command.  One way to guarantee that numlock will be turned on after bootup for the TTYs is to run '''setleds''' via '''rc.local''' (a script run after every runlevel change; which in particular runs after booting up).  To do so add something similar to the following in the file '''/etc/rc.local''':
<pre>
for tty in /dev/tty[1-6]; do
    /usr/bin/setleds -D +num < $tty
done
</pre>

== Enable NumLock in KDE ==

From the K Menu, launch System Settings and click on Keyboard (Edgy users: K Menu -> System Settings -> Keyboard and Mouse -> Keyboard). You can see in the middle section the options for "NumLock on KDE Startup", where you can choose to Turn On, Turn Off, or Leave Unchanged. Select "Turn On" to turn NumLock on at startup.

== Enable NumLock in Lubuntu ==

Enter Preferences -> LXQt Settings -> Keyboard and Mouse, and selecting the "Keyboard" tab will let you see a "Turn on NumLock after login" checkbox that you need to click.  Refer to the Lubuntu manual for more details.
