==== Nvidia on Sony laptop ====

After you installed Nvidia driver on Sony laptop, you probably will get a black screen, but when you connect a external monitor, surprisingly, it works.
This is because, Sony use softEDID, probably only Sony use softEDID, Nvidia driver can't fetch the EDID of the Sony internal display. But you can refer this http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=2118873&postcount=22, then you'll solve the black screen problem.
But after that, you will found you can't change brightness, please refer http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=143025&page=3. Then probably, it still won't work, please restart your computer try: 

dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.freedesktop.Hal  /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer_backlight org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.LaptopPanel.SetBrightness  int32:6

The last number could be 0~10.
