__TOC__


You could see three devices for the USB modem or  card, for example :

<pre>
/dev/ttyUSB0
/dev/ttyUSB1
/dev/ttyUSB2
</pre>

This is caused by missing bits in the hal-info package. To detect the problems, type in a <nowiki>[[terminal]]</nowiki> the output of :

<pre>
lshal
</pre>

Technically, only the device with

<pre>
 usb.interface.number = 0
</pre>

should be used by NetworkManager.
