__TOC__

<nowiki>[[http://www.zsnes.com|zsnes]]</nowiki> is a GPL Super Nintendo emulator.

== Download/Installation ==
zsnes is very easy to install since it is available in Synaptic from the multiverse.
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zsnes
</pre>

However, zsnes conflicts with the WikiPedia:Enlightened_Sound_Daemon (esd). We can fix this by killing esd before running zsnes and restarting it. We can create a script to do this. For the sake of demonstration, we will use a folder called ~/scripts, but you might put it in the same folder that zsnes was installed to.

Copy and paste the following into gedit. Save it as ~/scripts/zsnes.sh.

<pre>

killall esd
zsnes
esd -nobeeps &
</pre>

== Start ==
Start the game
<pre>
~/scripts/zsnes
</pre>

In a terminal, set the permissions to allow users to run the script.
<code> $ chmod 755 ~/scripts/zsnes.sh </code>

Now you can run the script by double clicking on it. Alternatively, you can set it up as a menu item using smeg.
