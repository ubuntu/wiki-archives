<nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DiskSpace#Separate%20/boot|Here]]</nowiki> is an introduction on why you would want a separate /boot partition.

The advice I have been given is that 200MB is a good size that will accommodate several installs of Ubuntu(or other GNU/Linux).

The only caveat that I see to this method of handling multiple installs of linux is that you can't just overwrite the main / partition to remove or upgrade an existing install of Ubuntu.  You will now have to ensure that old kernels are removed from your /boot.
