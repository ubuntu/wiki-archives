You can resize photos which are too big. If you have a photo which has a large file size, resizing it will also reduce the file size.

=== Using the GIMP Image Editor ===

The ''GIMP Image Editor'' supports several methods of resizing photos. We will concentrate on the simplest method.

# Open the photo you want to resize in the ''GIMP Image Editor''
# Press '''Image''' -> '''Scale Image...'''
# Adjust the ''Width'' or ''Height'' as appropriate. The image will be kept to scale
** If you want to adjust the width and height independently, press the link button which connects the ''Width'' and ''Height'' boxes, so that it looks like a broken link
# Under ''Quality'', change the ''Interpolation'' to ''Cubic (Best)''. This will give you the best quality resized image
# Press '''Scale''' to resize the photo
# Press '''File''' -> '''Save As...''' and choose a new filename for the photo
# Press '''Save''' to save the resized photo

''See the <nowiki>[[http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-scale.html|GIMP Documentation]]</nowiki> for more information.''

=== Using the Nautilus Image Converter ===
The Nautilus Image Converter allows you to simply right-click on an image in Nautilus and resize or rotate it. 

To install it, open Synaptic or the Ubuntu Software Center and search for "Nautilus Image Converter". You will need to log out and in again before it works.
