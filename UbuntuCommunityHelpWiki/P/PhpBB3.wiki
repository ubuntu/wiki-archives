=== PhpBB3 ===

PhpBB3 is a web forum application which runs on apache, mysql and php.  With it, you can host your own forum site.

This How-To has been tested on Ubuntu 9.10

=== LAMP Installation ===

Use <nowiki>[[InstallingSoftware| any method]]</nowiki> to install the LAMP stack packages:

<pre> 
tasksel
</pre>

select LAMP and follow instructions

Set a mysql-root password (not the same as a root password, but a password for mysql)

You should now have a functional LAMP stack.

Visit <nowiki>[[ApacheMySQLPHP|Apache PHP MySQL]]</nowiki> for more information on LAMP.

=== Enable the Universe repository ===
For install on 9.10 use default repository

=== Install Phpbb3 ===

Use <nowiki>[[InstallingSoftware| any method]]</nowiki> to install the following package:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install phpbb3 
</pre>

The installation of that package will also install the phpbb3 package and perform all the database configuration for you.  You will be prompted for the mysql root user password (not the same as the root user, but the mysql's user named root)

 <nowiki>[[File:phpbb2.jpg]]</nowiki>

Run this command to make the forum accessible through the web server
<pre>
sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpbb3/www /var/www/phpbb 
</pre>

Please read /usr/share/doc/phpbb3/README.Debian for more details.

You may need to reload apache's configuration if you have not done so since installing LAMP.  Do this if you get a message about the PHP environment not having support for a database.

<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</pre>

=== Configuration ===

Everything should now be installed and ready to go.

* Launch your web browser and type in: 
<pre>
http://localhost/phpbb
</pre>

The PHPBB3 webpage should display that the forum is disabled.

* Click Log in.
 <nowiki>[[File:login.jpg]]</nowiki>

* Use the default username and password:
<pre>
username = admin
password = admin
</pre>

* Click on the small link at the bottom of the page - '''GotoAdministrationPanel'''
 <nowiki>[[File:phpbb4.jpg]]</nowiki>

* Select the '''configuration''' link which is located under the sub heading '''General Admin''' on the lefthand side of the page. [Note: on ubuntu 10.04.1 and phpBB3 it's under /General/Board Configuration/Board Settings/Disable Board ]

* Set the option '''Disable Forum''' to '''No''' and click '''Submit''' at the bottom of the page.

Note: Also, don't forget to change the admin password as well.

=== Alternative to manual installation ===

Some users may prefer to skip manual installation by using the unofficial pre-integrated <nowiki>[[http://www.turnkeylinux.org/phpbb|TurnKey phpBB Appliance]]</nowiki> based on Ubuntu LTS.
