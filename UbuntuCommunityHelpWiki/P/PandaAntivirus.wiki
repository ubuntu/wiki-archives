<nowiki>[[http://www.pandasoftware.com/download/linux/linux.asp|Panda Antivirus for Linux]]</nowiki> is an antivirus for Linux servers and desktops. It is an antivirus designed to be managed from the command line or console. To do this, an executable called PAVCL will be used.

Other antiviruse applications that support Ubuntu can be found <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus|here]]</nowiki>.

The aim of Panda Antivirus is to scan and disinfect Windows and DOS workstations connected to a Linux server, as well as the Linux server itself. 

Panda Antivirus scans files using both string searches and heuristic methods. The target files are Word documents, Java Applets, ActiveX controls and compressed files (ZIP, RAR, etc.). At this time, it does not scan the boot sector or the partitions table.

There is no uninstaller, you have to removed the files manually if you want to uninstall the software.

== Usage ==
Syntax:
<pre>
pavcl [Scan path] -parameter1 -parameter2 ... -parameterN
</pre>

Example:
<pre>
pavcl /mnt/DOS -aex -clv
</pre>

=== Possible parameters ===
* pavcl '''-nbr''' This parameter or option prevents the user from interrupting the execution of the antivirus pavcl using the keys CTRL-C. However, the kill command can always be used to stop the execution.

* pavcl '''-clv''' When a scan is carried out and a virus is detected, the user will be asked what action they want the antivirus to take in order to remove the virus (disinfect, delete, etc).

* pavcl '''-nsb''' These two parameters indicate that the subdirectories (subfolders) correspond to the directory (folder) that is being scanned.  They are not the target of this scan.  If you use one, the antivirus will scan, and by default the corresponding directory and all of its subdirectories. 

* pavcl '''-heu''' Allows a heuristic scan to be carried out.  This scan consists of detecting viruses that have recently appeared, which the antivirus has not yet included in the Virus Signature File (this detects viruses that already exist). This results in a slower but more effective scan.

 The majority of detectable viruses are usually included in the Signature File.  Recent viruses are added whenever this file or the antivirus is updated.
 
* pavcl '''-cmp''' Allows compressed files to be scanned. These files as well as every file they contain will be scanned.
 
* pavcl '''-nso'''
* pavcl '''-nos'''
 Both of these parameters prevent the use of audio virus alerts.

* pavcl '''-aex''' Allows all of the files in the scanned drive and directory/directories to be subject to the scan. By default, the antivirus will only scan the extensions which may house viruses (EXE, COM, SYS...).  However, it may be worth scanning all files.
 
* pavcl '''-aut''' These parameters allow the antivirus to function automatically. In other words, it allows the scan/clean operation to be carried out without user intervention.  This means that the antivirus carries out the necessary scan/disinfection.

* pavcl '''-nor''' The -nor parameter prevents a report from being generated. 

* pavcl '''-esp''' Changes Spanish as default language. 

* pavcl '''-eng''' Changes English as default language.

* pavcl '''-?''' Displays the command line help.
