=== PhpBB2 ===

PhpBB2 is a web forum application which runs on apache, mysql and php.  With it, you can host your own forum site.

Follow these instructions to install PhpBB2 on Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake).

=== Alternative to manual installation ===

Some users may prefer to skip manual installation by using the unofficial pre-integrated <nowiki>[[http://www.turnkeylinux.org/phpbb|TurnKey phpBB Appliance]]</nowiki> based on Ubuntu LTS.

=== LAMP Installation ===

Use <nowiki>[[InstallingSoftware| any method]]</nowiki> to install the LAMP stack packages:

<pre> 
apache2 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server
</pre>

Set a mysql-root password (not the same as a root password, but a password for mysql)

<pre>
mysql -u root

mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('yourpassword');
</pre>

You should now have a functional LAMP stack.

Visit <nowiki>[[ApacheMySQLPHP|Apache PHP MySQL]]</nowiki> for more information on LAMP.

=== Enable the Universe repository ===

* <nowiki>[[Repositories-CommandLine| I am using Ubuntu server (command line)]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[AddingRepositoriesHowto| I am using a desktop]]</nowiki>

=== Install Phpbb2 ===

Use <nowiki>[[InstallingSoftware| any method]]</nowiki> to install the following package:

<pre>
phpbb2-conf-mysql 
</pre>

The installation of that package will also install the phpbb2 package and perform all the database configuration for you.  You will be prompted for the mysql root user password (not the same as the root user, but the mysql's user named root)

Run this command to make the forum accessible through the web server
<pre>
sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpbb2/site /var/www/phpbb 
</pre>

On newer versions of ubuntu/phpbb, it may be:

<pre>
sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpbb3/www /var/www/phpbb 
</pre>

Please read /usr/share/doc/phpbb2/README.Debian for more details.

You may need to reload apache's configuration if you have not done so since installing LAMP.  Do this if you get a message about the PHP environment not having support for a database.

<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</pre>

=== Configuration ===

Everything should now be installed and ready to go.

* Launch your web browser and type in: 
<pre>
http://localhost/phpbb
</pre>

The PHPBB2 webpage should display that the forum is disabled.

* Click Log in.
 <nowiki>[[File:phpbb3.jpg]]</nowiki>

* Use the default username and password:
<pre>
username = admin
password = admin
</pre>

* Click on the small link at the bottom of the page - '''GotoAdministrationPanel'''
 <nowiki>[[File:phpbb4.jpg]]</nowiki>

* Select the '''configuration''' link which is located under the sub heading '''General Admin''' on the lefthand side of the page.

* Set the option '''Disable Forum''' to '''No''' and click '''Submit''' at the bottom of the page.

Note: Also, don't forget to change the admin password as well.

=== Languages ===

There are 53 additional languages available for your forum.  The english language pack is already included in the phpbb2 package itself.  

To install all the other languages, use <nowiki>[[InstallingSoftware| any method]]</nowiki> to install the following package:
<pre>
phpbb2-languages
</pre>
