__TOC__


If you have a digital camera, you probably have a large number of photos. What's more, they probably have names like ''DSCF0024'', which aren't very meaningful.

You can rename large collections of photos at once using a ''batch renaming'' program, which saves you the effort of renaming them individually.

=== Bulk Rename ===

''Bulk Rename'' is a graphical interface for renaming any type of file. It is very powerful, intuitive, and easy to use, and allows you to insert, overwrite, remove, and number files. Unfortunately this program doesn't read the EXIF information embedded in the photos. Bulk Rename is part of ''Thunar File Manager''.

To install ''Bulk Rename'', press '''Applications''' -> '''Add/Remove...''' and then select ''Bulk Rename'' from the ''Accessories'' category.

=== Phatch ===

''Phatch'' is an user friendly, cross-platform Photo Batch Processor and Exif Renamer with a nice graphical user interface. Phatch handles all popular image formats and can duplicate (sub)folder hierarchies. Phatch can batch resize, rotate, apply shadows, perspective, rounded corners. See <nowiki>[[http://photobatch.wikidot.com/]]</nowiki>.

Phatch is found in Ubuntu's repositories.

This is an example how to rename in Phatch 0.1

Warning: Phatch 0.2 (Karmic) uses a different syntax: use <##index> instead of <##>.

=== jhead ===

''jhead'' is a command-line utility that can be used to manipulate EXIF data. It is able to handle batch renaming and is very useful in cases when the date of the picture is required as part of the name.

Install the ''jhead'' package to use ''jhead''.

==== Example Usage ====

To use ''jhead'', press '''Applications''' -> '''Accessories''' -> '''Terminal''' and type a command such as the following:

<code>jhead -n%y%m%d-%02i *.jpg</code>

For help, type ''jhead -h'' or visit <nowiki>[[http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/]]</nowiki>.
