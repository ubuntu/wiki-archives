== Introduction ==

phpPgAdmin is a web based PostgreSQL software management package.  To use it you should install and configure PHP, Apache and postgresql, see <nowiki>[[PostgreSQL]]</nowiki> for instructions.

== Installing From Package ==

Install '''phpPgAdmin''' from the Universe repository see InstallingSoftware for detailed instructions on using repositories and package managers. (Note, however, that installation from a package manager often does not work).

From console:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install phppgadmin
</pre>

For '''Ubuntu 14.10'''
edit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and add the following line to it:
<pre>
Include /etc/apache2/conf.d/phppgadmin
</pre>

'''For older Ububtu releases only''': to set up under Apache all you need to do is include the following line in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.
<pre>
Include /etc/phppgadmin/apache.conf
</pre>

== Access ==

Once phpPgAdmin is installed point your browser to <nowiki>[[http://localhost/phppgadmin]]</nowiki> to start using it.  You should be able to login using any users you've setup in PostgreSQL.

== Remote access ==

By default you can only access phppgadmin from localhost. If you want to be able to use it remotely, do the following:

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf.d/phppgadmin
</pre>

or for older Ubuntu releases
<pre>
sudo nano /etc/phppgadmin/apache.conf
</pre>

Comment out (add # at beginning of line) "allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128" and remove # from the line below it, "allow from all".

Then restart apache

<pre>
sudo service apache2 reload
</pre>
