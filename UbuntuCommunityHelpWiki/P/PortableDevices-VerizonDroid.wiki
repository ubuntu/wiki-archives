== Introduction ==

This page provides instructions on how to get the most out of Ubuntu Linux in combination with the Verizon Droid Android based phone. 

== Synchronizing PIM data with Evolution ==

The Verizon Droid uses cloud computing to store PIM data.  The cloud data can be synced with Evolution.  Prior to making any changes to data stored in Evolution, a backup of Contacts and Calendars is recommended.

* In Evolution select File > New > Address Book.  Give the address book a name, enter your gmail account name, and mark the address book as default.

* For the Calendar select File > New > Calendar.  Give the calendar a name, enter your gmail account name, and mark the calendar as default.

By default, contacts and calendar data are shared via the Google apps such as Gmail and Google Calendar. So if you use Gmail for regular mail, you should not have to bother about syncing with your PC.

== Synchronizing music with your phone ==

You can synchronize music with your phone via the supplied USB cable. If you connect the phone to your computer, your phone will show a notification. If you connect your phone to your PC you will receive a ''USB Connected'' message in the Notifications area on your phone. Expand the notifications area by swiping it down with your finger. Tap on the ''USB Connected'' message. Now you will have the opportunity to mount your phone. Tap the ''Mount'' button.  Ubuntu will recognize it as a music device and will display a popup message. You may have to choose to open it with rhythmbox.

Here you can choose to always open Rhythmbox if you connect your phone.

If you use Rhythmbox, you can synchronize files using the steps below:

* In Rhythmbox, choose Edit > Plugins and enable the '''Portable Players - MTP''' plugin
* You should now see the phone listed in the left pane of the Rhythmbox screen under '''Devices'''
* You can drag and drop music between the phone and your music collection or other devices.

If the Verizon Droid is not recognized as an audio device, this can be overridden by changing the HAL device information.  Further details can be found on the <nowiki>[[http://live.gnome.org/Rhythmbox/FAQ|RhythmboxFAQ]]</nowiki>.

EDIT: With the G2 the previous method doesn't work, the only software capable of sync the music is banshee.

Hint: In my G1 manual, which was in Dutch language, it stated that I should create a folder called ''Muziek'' on the SD card of the G1 to store my music in. However, Rhythmbox only recognizes files if the folder is called ''Music''. So I had to rename the folder on the phone in order to have Rhythmbox recognize the music I put on it earlier. 

== Synchronizing videos ==

The Android based phone supports the playback of !YouTube videos using its built-in video player. However, if you want your phone to carry private stuff, such as family videos, that you don't want to share on !YouTube, you can copy over videos to your phone. 

AndroidVideoEncoding explains the process of converting your private videos to G1-compatible formats.
