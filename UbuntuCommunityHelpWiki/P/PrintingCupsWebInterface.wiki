== Introduction ==

This guide is intended for Xubuntu and other users who cannot log into the CUPs web interface and would like to change their printer configuration with CUPs.

== Setting Up CUPs Web Interface ==

First you need to add yourself to the <code>lpadmin</code> group. In terminal:
<pre>
sudo usermod -aG lpadmin <username>
</pre>

Last thing is to restart CUPs. This can be done by typing:
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart
</pre>
into the terminal.

To get to the CUPs web interface open up <nowiki>[[http://localhost:631/]]</nowiki> in your web browser. When asked for a user name and password you can use you log-in user-name and password.

== Why you can't log into CUPs web interface in Ubuntu ==
