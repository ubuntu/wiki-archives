__TOC__

These two tools are available in the free Android Marketplace to Rogers users in Canada. 

Used together, they look like they would provide a safe backup of all data and applications. Please comment/add based on your experience.

* Backup for Root users - <nowiki>[[http://www.cyrket.com/package/com.bg.smsbk|@Cyrket]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://blackginsoft.blogspot.com/|official site]]</nowiki>
** Takes a lot of time
** Doesn't indicate where the backup is made (presumably, SD)
** No documentation
** Lots of backup methods (apps, data, specific databases, etc.)

* AppManager <nowiki>[[http://www.cyrket.com/package/de.android_telefonie.appmanager|@Cyrket]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://think-android.com/category/appmanager/|official site]]</nowiki>
** Quickly backs up or restore all applications ''packages'' only to SD.
