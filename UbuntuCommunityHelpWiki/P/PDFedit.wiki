== Why PDFedit? ==

People sometimes like to edit PDF documents. KWord has the ability to import, edit, and re-export PDFs, but the formatting often gets messed up during import. ''pdfjam'' is a command-line tool that allows you to do some sophisticated PDF manipulating (rotating, combining, splitting), but it also has limitations, and sometimes people are more comfortable with a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI).

== Installation ==

The ''pdfedit'' package is no longer available in the Ubuntu repositories as it depends on old qt3 libraries that Ubuntu no longer provides.

Consider <nowiki>[[https://askubuntu.com/questions/538966/how-can-i-install-pdfedit-on-ubuntu-14-04|this post on Ask Ubuntu]]</nowiki>.

== Launching PDFedit ==
Afterwards, you should be able to launch PDFedit with the command
<pre>
pdfedit
</pre>
