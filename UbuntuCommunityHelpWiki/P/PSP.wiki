== General Use ==

=== Mounting your PSP ===

Generally all you need to do to use your PSP is to plug the cable into a USB port. The PSP should be automatically recognized as a usb drive and appear on your GNOME desktop or in your KDE Device Notifier widget.

=== Unmounting/Ejecting your PSP ===

This is an important thing to do.
When you have finished using your PSP, you must right click on it's icon and select eject before unplugging it. This ensures that any files being written to the PSP are permanently saved and informs any programs that may be using files on the device.

=== Troubleshooting ===

If your PSP is not automatically recognized see the Troubleshooting section at
<nowiki>[[Mount-USB]]</nowiki>. 
This could be due to the "usb power" set to "on" over a usb port or wire that does not support usb powering.

== PSP Management and Video Encoding ==

=== PSPVC ===
PSPVC (Playstation Portable Video Convertor) is a FFMPEG front-end to convert video files for the PSP.

*** Uncompress the archive in a directory

*** First you need to install the dependencies: <pre>
sudo apt-get install nasm yasm libfaac-dev libxvidcore-dev libgtk2.0-dev liba52-dev
</pre>

*** Then go to the uncompressed directory and begin the installation: <pre>
sudo ./install.sh
</pre>

*** Users wishing to compile DVDs from VOBs may have to <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1684676&forum_id=535914|recompile]]</nowiki> with certain options.

==== Use ====

*** to launch the program, type in a terminal: <pre>

==== Installation ====

*** No package is available in the repositories yet, you will have to compile it manually

*** Download the .tar.gz archive from the official website: http://qpspmanager.sourceforge.net

*** Uncompress the archive on the Desktop

*** First you need to install the dependencies: <pre>
sudo apt-get install qt4-designer qt4-dev-tools build-essential zlib1g-dev
</pre>

*** Open a terminal, go to uncompressed directory then in the src directory <pre>
cd ~/Desktop/qpspmanager-2.0.2
</pre>

*** Then you need to compile and install the program: <pre>
qmake-qt4
</pre>

<pre>
make
</pre>

<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>
Unfortunetly the last step doesn't work for everyone (make install). Instead a QPSPManager executable file is made in the bin directory.
You can then copy this to /usr/local/bin yourself.

<pre>
sudo cp bin/QPSPManager /usr/local/bin
</pre>

As of 9.04 make produces errors.
<pre>
src/isocompressor.h:38: error: ‘uint32_t’ does not name a type
</pre>
The only work around I Could find was on an Italian forum so I thought i would add it here. First edit /src/isocompressor.h to include 
<pre>
right below 
</pre> 
Then run qmake. after qmake finishes open the make file and change.
<pre>
CXXFLAGS      = -pipe -O2 -Wall -W -D_REENTRANT $(DEFINES)
to
CXXFLAGS      = -pipe -O2 -Wall -W -D_REENTRANT $(DEFINES) -std=c++0x
</pre>
Then you can go ahead and  
<pre>
make
sudo make install
sudo cp bin/QPSPManager /usr/local/bin
</pre>

==== Use ====

*** to launch the program, type in a terminal: <pre>
QPSPManager
</pre>

=== Command line video encoding ===
Please contribute for other output profiles or sources. Of special interest are the current profiles added to the firmware 5.x
