== I get HTTP 401 errors when trying to install software I bought. How to fix it? ==

This can be caused by a couple of things.  First, check to make sure you don't have a local configuration error on your computer.  To do this, you will need to remove potentially-broken 
authentication data from your subscriptions.

=== Local configuration clean-up ===

The first step is to remove old data from /etc/apt/auth.conf .  
Open it up as the superuser with a text editor.  Normally, you 
can do this by pressing Alt-F2 (or running a terminal) and 
running this:

  '''gksudo gedit /etc/apt/auth.conf'''

With that file open, you will need to remove the clauses for the 
package which isn't working, then save the file.  For example, 
let's say your file looks like this:

<pre>
  machine private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/amnesia/ubuntu
  login myname
  password mYPasSwORd1

  machine private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/bastion/ubuntu
  login myname
  password mYPasSwORd2

  machine private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/bastion/ubuntu
  login myname
  password mYPasSwORd3

  machine private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/limbo/ubuntu
  login myname
  password mYPasSwORd4
</pre>
If the broken download is for Bastion (for example), remove both 
of the middle sections.  Afterward, the file would look like 
this, with no reference to the broken package:

<pre>
  machine private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/amnesia/ubuntu
  login myname
  password mYPasSwORd1

  machine private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/limbo/ubuntu
  login myname
  password mYPasSwORd4
</pre>
Then save the file and quit from gedit.

The second step is to remove old package feeds.  This is done by 
running a command again.  As in the previous step, press Alt-F2 
or open a terminal, then run the following command (after 
replacing 'bastion' with the name of the package which isn't 
installing):

  '''gksudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*bastion*'''

The final step is to try 'File -> Reinstall previous purchases' 
again in Ubuntu Software Center.
