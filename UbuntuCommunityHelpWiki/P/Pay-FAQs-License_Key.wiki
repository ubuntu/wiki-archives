== Where do I get the license key for the software I purchased? ==

Some of the products in Ubuntu Software Center require a license key in order to work.  These keys are only needed when the software developer decides to require keys for their product.

License keys are available in three places:
* At the top of the receipt emailed to you during purchase (The line starts with "Your license key for this application is:..." ).
* In the online copy of your receipt.  If you do not have your original receipt, you can get a copy here:  https://pay.ubuntu.com/payment/ .  Simply click on the orange link with your payment id.
* In your subscription details.  Go to https://software-center.ubuntu.com/subscriptions/ , click on the title you want the key for, and the key should be displayed in the middle of the page.

If the product you purchased requires a license key but no key was included on your receipt, please <nowiki>[[Pay|contact Ubuntu Software Center support]]</nowiki> to let us know.  We will need to resolve the problem and get the vendor to fix their product.
