__TOC__

It is possible to make modern digital photos look old-fashioned by applying a ''sepia'' effect.

''See <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepia_tone|Wikipedia]]</nowiki> for more information on sepia photos.''

=== Using the GIMP Image Editor ===

The GIMP provides a filter especially for making images look old. Alternatively, you can add a sepia effect manually.

==== Use the Old Photo filter ====

## Open a photo in the ''GIMP Image Editor''
## Press '''Script-Fu''' -> '''Decor''' -> '''Old Photo...'''
## Ensure that ''Sepia'' is ticked and press '''OK''' to apply the effect (see screenshot)
## If the resulting image appears too light, increase the contrast:
## Press '''Tools''' -> '''Color Tools''' -> '''Brightness-Contrast...'''
## Ensure that ''Preview'' is ticked
## Move the ''Contrast'' slider to the right to increase the contrast
## Press '''OK''' when you are happy with your changes

==== Manually add a sepia colour effect ====

## Open a photo in the ''GIMP Image Editor''
## Press '''Tools''' -> '''Color Tools''' -> '''Hue-Saturation...'''
## Under ''Select Primary Color to Modify'', ensure that '''Master''' is selected
## Move the ''Saturation'' slider as far to the left as possible and press '''OK'''. This will make the photo black and white
## Press '''Tools''' -> '''Color Tools''' -> '''Color Balance...'''
## Under ''Modify Selected Range's Color Levels'':
** Move the ''first'' slider towards ''Red'' (about 45)
** Move the ''third'' slider towards ''Yellow'' (about -45)
  1. Once you are happy with the way the photo looks, press '''OK'''

=== Using F-Spot Photo Manager ===

''F-Spot'' is able to convert photos to sepia, although you will probably get better results if you use the ''GIMP Image Editor''.

# Open ''F-Spot Photo Manager'' and find a photo
# Double-click the photo
# Press '''Convert the photo to sepia tones''' (see below)
