== Why can’t I buy software in the latest Ubuntu release? (16.04) ==

The Ubuntu Software Center had grown old, and hard to maintain. It was giving users some problems, so we chose to offer a better user experience by providing a new Software Center. Sadly, this meant not being able to sell apps for a while - but it’s a feature that will be available again at some point of the future.
