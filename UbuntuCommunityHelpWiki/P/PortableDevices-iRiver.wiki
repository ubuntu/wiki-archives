== iriver T10, T20, and T30 ==

iriver devices such as the T10 and T30 often ship in "MTP mode", which doesn't work with most Linux multimedia apps. Using the Windows firmware upgrade tool, you can switch it to UMS mode, allowing it to work as a USB mass storage device in Linux.  See <nowiki>[[http://audible.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3577/~/how-do-i-convert-my-iriver-from-ums-to-mtp-mode|here]]</nowiki> for instructions to switch from MTP to UMS mode.
