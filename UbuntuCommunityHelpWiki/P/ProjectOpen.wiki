__TOC__


]project-open[ is an open source project management server with a focus on finance and collaboration. It’s main purpose is to coordinate the work of project managers, project members and stake holders across multiple projects. Target organizations are IT companies, general consulting companies and corporate IT departments that need to track finances, tasks, and resources for a number of concurrently running projects.

If you are new to ]project-open[, please find more information on http://www.project-open.com/ (homepage), http://www.project-open.org/ (Wiki) or http://demo.project-open.net/ (demo servers).

ProjectOpen is written as "]project-open[". These strange outward pointing brackets around the name "project-open" are supposed to mean ]open[ as opposed to [closed].
