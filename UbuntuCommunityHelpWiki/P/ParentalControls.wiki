== Parental Content Control ==
There are many options available for parents to filter the web content their children are viewing. There are several solutions that will work with Linux including browser-based filtering through Firefox extensions, DNS-based filtering using OpenDNS' free service, do it yourself allow listing or a set of free applications configured to work specifically for web content filtering.

=== DansGuardian/Privoxy/Squid ===
==== DansGuardian ====
Dans``Guardian is a powerful filtering tool with many features to block unwanted sites. Among some of it's features are blocking text and HTML pages based on obscene content, IP addresses, and URLs. It can also be configured to work off a 'allow-list' where all sites except those listed will be blocked. The stealth mode feature is particularly nice if you have teenagers. This feature allows sites that would otherwise be blocked, but reports them in a log. 

However nice, Dans``Guardian is just a filter and will need to be paired with a proxy to do the web stuff. A proxy is a program that sits between your computer and the internet. It funnels all incoming connections through one opening called a port. Usually proxies have additional features such as web-caching and filtering. There are many choices of proxies that one can choose, but we will focus on one to get you started: <nowiki>[[Privoxy]]</nowiki>. 

Please view this page if you are would like to know more about the <nowiki>[[http://dansguardian.org/?page=dgflow|flow of events]]</nowiki> in Dans``Guardian. 

==== Privoxy ====
"Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks."

=== Browser Based Content Controls ===
There are some Firefox add-ons that offer content filtering.
** Leech``Block - Leech``Block lets you specify which sites to block and when to block them. Allows you to time limit website usage.

You can get Leech``Block Firefox add-on <nowiki>[[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/ | here.]]</nowiki>

** Fox``Filter - Recently called "THE Parental Control for Firefox" Fox``Filter is a personal content filter that helps block pornographic and other inappropriate content. All filtering features are free! Premium features available with small support fee.

You can get Fox``Filter Firefox add-on <nowiki>[[ https:--addons.mozilla.org-en-US-firefox-addon-foxfilter- | here.]]</nowiki>

=== Content Control With a GUI ===
There have been many attempts to produce GUI 'wrappers' to make the process of setting up Content Control easier. Many of these have, over time, have stopped being maintained. Nanny, being a Gnome project probably stands the best chance of being maintained long-term.

==== Web Content Control ====
Web Content Control is a program in Ubuntu that lets you block unwanted contents such as adult materials, violence and other disturbing websites. It can also be used as a Parental Control System to control what programs/games can be run and played.

An introduction to setting up Web Content Control on Ubuntu 10.10 <nowiki>[[ http:--www.liberiangeek.net-2010-08-enable-web-content-filtering-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx-web-content-control- | here.]]</nowiki>

==== Nanny ====
Gnome Nanny is an easy way to control what your kids are doing on the computer. You can limit how much time a day each one of them is browsing the web, chatting or doing email. You can also decide at which times of the day they can do these things.

Gnome Nanny filters what web pages are seen by each user, so you can block all undesirable webs and have your kids enjoy the internet with ease of mind, no more worries!

Note that Nanny stopped being available with Ubuntu Oneiric as it relies on an old version of Gnome.

==== Open DNS ====
OpenDNS is perhaps best known for its ability to provide an alternative to your ISP's DNS servers. The other service provided by OpenDNS happens to also include the option to engage web-based parental controls. So any computer configured to utilize OpenDNS for its DNS settings also has the ability to filter out the junk content you might not want made available in your household.

===== Getting Started with Open DNS =====
1. To get started, go to ''System –> Preferences –> Network Connections''
2. Then select the default interface and click ‘Edit’.
3. Next, ‘IPv4 Settings’ and choose ‘Automatic (DHCP) addresses only’ for Method.
4. And finally, type the DNS Server addresses below into the DNS Server field and click ‘Apply’
''208.67.222.123, 208.67.220.123''
5. When you’re done, click <nowiki>[[https://store.opendns.com/familyshield/welcome/|this link]]</nowiki> to verify if your setting is OK. You will get a Green Checkmark if everything is OK. You will see a Red X if something went wrong.

=== Do It Yourself Allow-listing ===
Block access to the entire Internet except for the IP addresses/websites allow-listed in the hosts file.

Open a Terminal [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[T] and backup hosts:

 <code>sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.old</code>

Then edit the hosts file with a text editor (gedit, mousepad, nano, etc.)

 <code>sudo <text editor> /etc/hosts</code>

The format of the allow list is the IP address, space, the domain name, space, the domain name with www in front of it.

 <code>12.34.567.89 domain.com www.domain.com</code>

To add websites to this list; go to an IP address lookup page such as this <nowiki>[[http://www.hcidata.info/host2ip.htm | one]]</nowiki> or this <nowiki>[[http://whatismyipaddress.com/hostname-ip | one]]</nowiki>. Many sites pull-in content from other servers and/or domains, so you may need to examine the code (view the page source) of the web page(s) to find all the domains you'll need. A quick way to find a lot of  domains referenced is to search the page source for "http" When done adding to the list, save [Ctrl]+[S] and "X" out of the hosts file.

Back in a Terminal, type (or copy and paste):

 <code>sudo <text editor> /etc/nsswitch.conf</code>

Find the hosts line

 hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns

and remove everything after files, so the line becomes

 hosts: files

Save [Ctrl]+[S] and "X" out of the nsswitch.conf file

That's all there is to it. Everything except approved domains/IP addresses are blocked. Edit the hosts file to allow (or remove) access to additional websites.

Edit the hosts file again to allow access to additional websites (or remove sites).

To use the original nsswitch file (to look for additional websites / pages / servers and / or to run updates):

 <code>sudo cp /etc/nsswitch.conf.old /etc/nsswitch.conf</code>

Edit the host line again to blocklist the Internet except for the servers in hosts

To use the original hosts file again:

 <code>sudo cp /etc/hosts.old /etc/hosts</code>
 

Get a head start for the allow-list of a child's computer by downloading a "base file" of hundreds of educational websites from <nowiki>[[http://savingus.org/download/allow-list-buntu.txt | here]]</nowiki>.
