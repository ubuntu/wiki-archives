__TOC__

You may want to add an effect to a photo to make it look more interesting or fun. The ''GIMP Image Editor'' has a large collection of effects which you can use. Have fun playing with some of them!

|}

=== Cubism ===

The ''Cubism'' filter turns your pictures into a jumble of squares.

# Press '''Filters''' -> '''Artistic''' -> '''Cubism...'''
# Change the ''Tile size'' to change the size of the squares used
# Press '''OK''' to apply the effect. This may take a short while.

''See the <nowiki>[[http://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-cubism.html|GIMP Documentation]]</nowiki> for more information.''

=== Lens Flare ===

The ''GFlare'' filter adds an artificial lens flare to your photos.

# Press '''Filters''' -> '''Light Effects''' -> '''GFlare...'''
# Click on the location on the preview where you would like the centre of the lens flare to be placed
# Select a ''Selector''. ''Distant_Sun'' should be a good choice in most situations
# Select the ''Settings'' tab.
** Increase the ''Radius'' to make the lens flare bigger
** Change the ''Hue rotation'' to change the color of the flare
** Change the ''Vector Angle'' to change the angle of the secondary flares
** Change the ''Vector Length'' to change the length of the line of secondary flares
1.#5 Press '''OK''' to apply the effect

You may wish to apply the lens flare effect to a new layer, so that you can change its appearance independent from the rest of the image.

# Press '''Layer''' -> '''New Layer...'''
# Name the layer ''Lens flare'' and ensure that the ''Layer Fill Type'' is set to ''Transparency''
# Switch to the ''Layers...'' window. If you cannot see a window with ''Layers'' in its title, switch to the window named ''The GIMP'' and press '''File''' -> '''Dialogues''' -> '''Layers''' to open it
# Ensure that the layer ''Lens flare'' is selected
# Follow the steps above to add a lens flare effect
# Back in the ''Layers'' window, move the ''Opacity'' slider to change the opacity of the lens flare
# You can use other tools to modify the lens flare layer

''See the <nowiki>[[http://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-gflare.html|GIMP Documentation]]</nowiki> for more information.''

=== Filmstrip ===

You can select a set of photos and add them to a 'filmstrip', so it looks like each photo is a single frame on a strip of film.

# Open all of the photos that you want to put on the filmstrip
# Press '''Filters''' -> '''Combine''' -> '''Film...'''
# On the ''Selection'' tab, under ''Image Selection'', select all of the photos that you want to use and press '''Add'''
# Press '''OK''' to combine the images into a new image
