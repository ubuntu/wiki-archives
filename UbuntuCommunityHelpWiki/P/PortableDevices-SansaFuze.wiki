Sansa Fuze(+) doesn't work out of the box with the current version of rythmbox or banshee with Ubuntu 10.10. Here's a short description how to get it work.

== First Section ==

First of all you need to create a file with the name .is_audio_player in the root directory of the multimedia player:

<pre>
touch /media/SANSA\ FUZEP/.is_audio_player
</pre>

After that you need to configure the file:

<pre>
audio_folders=Music/
folder_depth=2
output_formats=audio/ogg,audio/mp3

cover_art_file_type=jpeg
cover_art_file_name=folder.jpg
cover_art_size=300
</pre>

After that the Sansa Fuze(+) should be displayed on rhythmbox or banshee and you can simply drag & drop your music to the player.
