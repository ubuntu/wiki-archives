Lubuntu does not change the Ubuntu networking setup, so Ubuntu <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetAndNetworking | networking documentation]]</nowiki> applies to Lubuntu.

Look in the "tray" for <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager0.7 | Network Manager.]]</nowiki> It aims for Network Connectivity which "Just Works".
Sharing your Lubuntu files has to be done manually.  
But <nowiki>[[Lubuntu-PCManFM]]</nowiki> can connect to existing Samba shares automatically.

A common problem is to upgrade to Lubuntu and lose your wireless connection.
We suggest you ask our voluneers in  <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=336 |the networking sub-forum]]</nowiki> of Ubuntu Forums.  You will need the model number of your network adapter or laptop, and please be prepared to use the command line.

=== Change Hostname ===

To change hostname temporarily (until next reboot)
<pre>
sudo hostname mynewhostnamehere
</pre>

To change permanently, after next reboot
edit  /etc/hostname

and also edit (second line, I believe)
 /etc/hosts
