Lubuntu uses PCManFM to browse files on your computer or network.  
Besides these <nowiki>[[ http:--wiki.lxde.org-en-PCManFM#FeaturesPCManFM | features,]]</nowiki>  PCManFM can 
* Eject DVDs or CD-ROMs (may close window)
* Browse Network Neighborhood
* Safely Remove Flash Drives
* Empty Your Trashcan
* Modify folders as the root user.

== Fixes ==
=== Deleted Desktop Folder ===
After you delete your Desktop directory in your home folder, PCManFM won't find it if you create a new Desktop folder.<<BR>>
Edit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs from<<BR>>
XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/"<<BR>>
to
XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/Desktop"<<BR>>
and restart PCManFM by logging out.

=== Right-clicking on desktop pulls up a menu that is missing the "Desktop Preferences" option and now I can't change my wallpaper ===

Instead of this:

<nowiki>[[File:Tooltip_003.png]]</nowiki>

you see this:

<nowiki>[[File:Menu_001.png]]</nowiki>

which is actually the `openbox` menu.

Using `lxterminal` or choosing "Run" from the menu, use:
<pre>
pcmanfm --desktop-pref
</pre>
then click on the "Advanced" tab and uncheck "show menus provided by window managers when desktop is clicked" which will solve the menu problem.

If you want to change your wallpaper, click the "Appearance" tab before you close.

=== How to search for files in Lubuntu using GUI application ===

A file find feature is planned for a future Lubuntu.<<BR>>
Lubuntu by default doesn't have a tool for search but it's easy to install one:<<BR>>
Install this package: ```catfish```

The application can be found in:
LXDE Menu > Accessories > Catfish

-----
=== Browse Windows PCs with Samba ===
type smb:// or smb://machinename/share into the address bar <<BR>>
other GVFS urls that work
* ftp://
* sftp://
* and <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/a/189491/21503| others]]</nowiki> although I know http:// does not work.
=== Directory Contents not up to date ===
Press ctrl+r or f5 to refresh files in the folder.<<BR>>
ctrl+h shows hidden files<<BR>>
shift+del permanently deletes a file without sending it to the Trash.<<BR>>
------
=== How can I create a shortcut on the Desktop ===

Right click on the programme icon from the menu, there is an option there to add to desktop.
