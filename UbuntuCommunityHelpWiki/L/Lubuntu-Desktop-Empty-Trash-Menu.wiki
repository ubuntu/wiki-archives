== "Empty Trash" Menu ==
You can add this missing feature in LXDE, emptying the trash can using a menu thanks to the file manager actions (it should be compatible with all versions of PCManFM except maybe Qt based builds, for now).

=== For Lubuntu 15.04 and 15.10 ===

Open a LXTerminal and use these five commands:

# sudo apt-get install trash-cli
# mkdir --parents $HOME/.local/share/file-manager/actions
# wget -O $HOME/.local/share/file-manager/actions/ask-trash-empty.desktop https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasBernaerts/ubuntu-scripts/master/lubuntu/trash-empty/ask-trash-empty.desktop
# sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ask-trash-empty https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasBernaerts/ubuntu-scripts/master/lubuntu/trash-empty/ask-trash-empty
# sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ask-trash-empty

Re-login again and everything should work smoothly.

=== For Lubuntu 14.10, LTS and below ===

Even though these options haven't been tested, the options should work as suggested in the above paragraph.
