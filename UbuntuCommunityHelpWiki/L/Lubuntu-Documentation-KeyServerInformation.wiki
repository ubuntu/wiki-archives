== Key Server Information ==

Every so often, the main Ubuntu key-server gets over-loaded with key requests for when you wish to add something to your repository, there are many other key servers but the MIT-edu one should be able to cope. The command is

<pre>
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu  --recv-keys ACC3E225CF57B0F4</pre>

Where you replace the ACC3E225CF57B0F4 with what ever key it is you are wishing to import.

*** --keyserver tells it to use a certain key server, in this instance the one at pgp.mit.edu
