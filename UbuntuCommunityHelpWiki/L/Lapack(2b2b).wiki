== Introduction ==

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/faq.png]]</nowiki> There exists a rich variety of libraries for solving mathematical problems numerically in C++. The <nowiki>[[http://www.netlib.org/|Netlib Repository]]</nowiki>
is a good resource for information on this subject. The disadvantage of most of the libraries available there (like <nowiki>[[http://www.netlib.org/clapack/index.html|CLAPACK]]</nowiki>) is that they are outdated or at least not actively maintained.

Because of this, the project <nowiki>[[http://lapackpp.sourceforge.net/|Lapack++]]</nowiki> has been brought to life. It bases on <nowiki>[[http://www.netlib.org/lapack++/index.html|lapack++]]</nowiki>, which would later evolve into <nowiki>[[http://math.nist.gov/tnt/|TNT]]</nowiki>, which however was never truly released. Therefore the developer <nowiki>[[http://www.cstim.de/|Christian Stimming]]</nowiki> {de} {en} came to the opinion that there should be something more up-to-date. Like many other mathematical libraries, Lapack++ bases on the two Fortran libraries <nowiki>[[http://www.netlib.org/blas/index.html|BLAS]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html|LAPACK]]</nowiki> which were converted from Fortran code to C code by a wrapper called <nowiki>[[http://www.netlib.org/f2c/index.html|f2c]]</nowiki>.

An alternative to Lapack++ is <nowiki>[[http://itpp.sourceforge.net/|IT++]]</nowiki>. However, IT++ is licensed by the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpl|GPL]]</nowiki>. This may not be suitable for companies who do not wish to make the source code of ther projects freely available. In contrast to this Lapack++ is licensed by the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License|LGPL]]</nowiki> and can therefore be used for non-open-source projects as well.

== Installation ==
=== Dependencies ===

Prior to installing Lapack++, the following packages have to be installed:

* '''build-essential'''
* '''lapack3-dev''' 
* '''refblas3-dev'''
* '''atlas3-base-dev''' (''universe'')

By this the Fortran compiler '''g77''' will be installed, too.

=== Compiling ===

In order to install the Lapack++ library, one has to compile it from source. The sources can be downloaded from <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=99696|this page]]</nowiki>.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/note.png]]</nowiki> It is recommended to have a look at the Wiki document CompilingSoftware if you are not familiar with compiling software.

* the required download has a name of the form <code>lapackpp-X.X.X.tar.gz</code> (the current one as of April 2007 is <code>lapackpp-2.5.1.tar.gz</code>)
* untar the file and change into the newly created subfolder <code>lapackpp-X.X.X</code>
* compile and install Lapack++ with the usual commands <code>./configure</code> , <code>make</code> and <code>sudo make install</code>

== Usage ==

After a default install, the header files of the library reside in <code>/usr/local/lapackpp</code> and can be included in C++ programs with:

<pre>
}}}

The library files are installed to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> with <code>liblapackpp.so</code> being the main file. A linker command may therefore look like:

{{{
gcc -L/usr/local/lib -llapackpp foo.o
</pre>

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> Some parts of the library are still from the original lapack++ 1.0 from 1998 and they may contain bugs. Also, all the undocumented files were not tested.

== Troubleshooting ==

If Lapack++ is installed to <code>/usr/local</code> (which is the default), the libraries will probably not be found:

<pre>
./lapack: error while loading shared libraries: liblapackpp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</pre>

This can be resolved by editing (or creating) the file <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> in an editor with root privileges. One line with the installation path of the library

<pre>
/usr/local/lib
</pre>

has to be added to the file. After that, the environment variables for the library path have to be reloaded by entering the following command in a terminal:

<pre>
sudo ldconfig
</pre>
