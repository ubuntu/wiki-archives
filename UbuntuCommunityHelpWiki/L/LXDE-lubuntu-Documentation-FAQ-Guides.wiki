Whilst not installed by default, Lubuntu does fully support Firefox.

=== Disable Bluetooth ===

This is achieved by blacklisting the relevant bluetooth modules. To find these, issue the following in <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/LXTerminal | LXterminal]]</nowiki>:
<pre>
lsmod | grep bluetooth
</pre>
An example out would be:
<pre>
bluetooth             179900  23 rfcomm,bnep,btusb
</pre>
Using the above example, you would edit the blacklist.conf file, again using <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/LXTerminal | LXterminal]]</nowiki>:
<pre>
gksudo leafpad /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
</pre>
and add the following lines to the end of the file:
<pre>
blacklist rfcomm
blacklist bnep
blacklist btusb
blacklist bluetooth
</pre>
After rebooting, issuing:
<pre>
lsmod | grep bluetooth
</pre>
Should not find anything.

=== Change Proxy settings for Web ===
* Open the lubuntu ppa <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-desktop/+archive/ppa/+packages|site.]]</nowiki>

-----
=== Change Fonts in Lubuntu ===
Moved to <nowiki>[[Lubuntu-Setup]]</nowiki>

==== I have an English desktop and I want calendar week to start from Monday instead of Sunday ====

Firstly edit locale file
<pre>
gksudo leafpad /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US
</pre>

Then change
<pre>
first_weekday   1
first_workday   2
</pre>

to

<pre>
first_weekday   2
first_workday   2
</pre>

After this you need to generate locales

<pre>
sudo locale-gen
</pre>

And logout and login, as you cant run alt+f2 application launcher without lxpanel which needs to be killed.

------
=== Create New Keyboard shortcuts ===
Moved to <nowiki>[[Lubuntu-Keyboard]]</nowiki>

------
=== Restart lxpanel ===
<pre>
lxpanelctl restart
or 
killall lxpanel && lxpanel --profile Lubuntu
</pre>

------
=== Add LED indicator for HDD access ===
Many new laptops and pretty much all netbooks don't have a hard drive activity LED, the below little script will convert a choice of three keyboard LEDs to show disk access. 

INDICATOR=caps

OLD=$(egrep "pgpgin|pgpgout" /proc/vmstat)
NEW=${OLD} ## Initialise both variables to start out
while :; do
  NEW=$(egrep "pgpgin|pgpgout" /proc/vmstat) # get status 
  if [ "$NEW" = "$OLD" ]; then  ## no change, turn led off
    setleds -L -${INDICATOR} < /dev/console 
  else  ## vmstat changed, turn the led on
    setleds -L +${INDICATOR} < /dev/console
  fi; sleep 0.1; ## prevent us from iterating too quickly
  OLD=${NEW} # Copy new state for the next iteration.
done
------
=== Change size of icons on desktop ===

The desktop is controlled by pcmanfm

Open the file manager and go to Edit->Preferences

Choose Display
Then change the size of 'Big' Icons to something smaller.
