=== Lubuntu Releases ===

All archived releases should be found <nowiki>[[http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/lubuntu/|here]]</nowiki>.

In a rare case, recently EoL releases will end up <nowiki>[[http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/|here]]</nowiki>.

Otherwise, look here:

==== 15.10 ====

Wily Werewolf is supported until July 2016. Although it does not allow power PCs, it does support the Intel based 64bit Macs.

All installation images are available on 
<nowiki>[[http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/wily/release/| Download Page for Lubuntu 15.10]]</nowiki> (except for minimal install) with mirrors <nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/lubuntu/wily/ | here]]</nowiki>.
* Desktop (Graphical Installer) - These versions are suitable for PC's with over 256 MB of RAM.  Do not try to install 64 Bit on a 32 Bit machine. Installing 32 Bit onto 64 Bit is totally safe. Please see the section <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu#Low_RAM_Computers | Low RAM Computers]]</nowiki> for installations on Computers with less resources.
* Alternate (Non-Graphical Install) - The Alternate images for 64-bit and 32-bit computers allow installing Lubuntu to PCs  with less than 4.3GB Hard Disk and low RAM (below 256MB).
* Minimal Install - The <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/MinimalInstall | Minimal Install]]</nowiki> images use the lowest system resources. It is known to work on a Pentium 2 with 64MB of RAM when using the Lubuntu core system.
* Intel Mac Images - The Lubuntu desktop system should run quite happily on all of the Intel Mac series, use the alternate versions only if you have non-standard setups. 
* PPC Mac - Not available, as 15.10 is not an LTS

==== 14.04 ====

A still supported Long-term Support distribution, although it does not allow power PCs. Ahis version, AMD64-Mac has been merged into AMD64 for all flavours.

All installation images are available on 
<nowiki>[[http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/trusty/release/| Download Page for Lubuntu 14.04]]</nowiki> (except for minimal install) with mirrors <nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/lubuntu/trusty/ | here]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://lubuntu.lafibre.info/14.04/ | here]]</nowiki>.
* Desktop (Graphical Installer) - These versions are suitable for PC's with over 256 MB of RAM.  Do not try to install 64 Bit on a 32 Bit machine. Installing 32 Bit onto 64 Bit is totally safe.

* Intel Mac Images - The Lubuntu desktop system should run quite happily on all of the Intel Mac series, use the alternate versions only if you have non-standard setups. 
* PPC Mac - Lubuntu has been found to run on a G4 running at 867MHz with 640MiB RAM, although it was noted that using the Alternate Installer was a lot faster. Another tester found that a G3 CPU: 400MHz required the following:

==== 10.04 ====
As support for the i386, i486, i586 chipsets (VIA C3, AMD K6, National Semiconductor and AMD Geode) has been dropped from both the kernel and GCC by Ubuntu from the 10.10 series onwards, you can choose this version for older hardware. <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/10.04 | 10.04]]</nowiki> Has all the details. Please note that 10.04 is no longer supported and does not receive updates for desktop, the kernel was supported until <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases |  April 2015 ]]</nowiki>

* 32 bit minimal install - For those people with less than 160MB of available RAM (Typically 192MB for Computers with built in graphics). It is a full installation but does not use the standard installer. This minimal version is discussed at the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/MinimalInstall | minimal install]]</nowiki> page.
* 32 bit iso - Available from <nowiki>[[http:-phillw.net-iso-lubuntu-lucid | lucid]]</nowiki>.
