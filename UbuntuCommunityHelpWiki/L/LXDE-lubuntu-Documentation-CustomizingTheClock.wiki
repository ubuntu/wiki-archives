== The Lubuntu Clock ==
The lubuntu date / time display is very adaptable.
=== Beginners ===
==== Use Languages ====
<nowiki>[[Lubuntu-Documentation-LanguageSupport | Language Support]]</nowiki> has details as to how to use the the language support tab to alter local settings.
==== Edit the command clock settings ====

Right Click on the clock, and select '''"Digital Clock" Settings''' 

<nowiki>[[File:lubuntu-clock.png]]</nowiki>

The default is '''%R''' which is the clock in 24 Hour Format, based on your local time-zone. To explain how adaptable it is, below are a couple of examples to get you started. 

It is Friday the 16th July 2010, at 35 seconds past 22 minutes past 4 o'clock in the afternoon. It currently shows as '''16:42''' and you want it displayed as 

* 04:22 PM
<pre>
%I:%M %p
</pre>
* Fri 16 Jul 10 04:22 PM
<pre>
%a %d %b %y  %I:%M %p
</pre>
* 07-16-10 04:22:35 PM
<pre>
%F %r
</pre>

If you set up your time-zone up when you installed your system, then
<pre>
%c
</pre>
will give you your date and time with your localised settings.

=== Easy ===
<nowiki>[[http://www.foragoodstrftime.com/ | For a Good Strftime]]</nowiki> is a website that builds your "time string" for you.

=== Advanced ===

These command strings also apply accross all the time and date systems for configuration across the *buntu system.

The entire list of what you can customise is
 
* %A is replaced by national representation of the full weekday name.

* %a is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated weekday name.

* %B is replaced by national representation of the full month name.

* %b is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated month name.

* %C is replaced by (year / 100) as decimal number; single digits are preceded by a zero.

* %c is replaced by national representation of time and date.

* %D is equivalent to ``%m/%d/%y''.

* %d    is replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number (01-31).

* %E* %O* POSIX locale extensions.  The sequences %Ec %EC %Ex %EX %Ey %EY %Od  %Oe %OH %OI %Om %OM %OS %Ou %OU %OV %Ow %OW %Oy are supposed to provide alternate representations. Additionly %OB implemented to represent alternative months names (used standalone, without day mentioned).

* %e    is replaced by the day of month as a decimal number (1-31); single digits are preceded by a blank.

* %F    is equivalent to ``%Y-%m-%d''.

* %G    is replaced by a year as a decimal number with century.  This year is the one that contains the greater part of the week (Monday as the first day of the week).

* %g    is replaced by the same year as in ``%G'', but as a decimal number without century (00-99).

* %H    is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (00-23).

* %I    is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (01-12).

* %j    is replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number (001-366).

* %k    is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (0-23); single digits are preceded by a blank.

* %l    is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (1-12); single digits are preceded by a blank.

* %M    is replaced by the minute as a decimal number (00-59).

* %m    is replaced by the month as a decimal number (01-12).

* %n    is replaced by a newline.

* %O*   the same as %E*.

* %p    is replaced by national representation of either "ante meridiem" or "post meridiem" as appropriate.

* %R    is equivalent to ``%H:%M''.

* %r    is equivalent to ``%I:%M:%S %p''.

* %S    is replaced by the second as a decimal number (00-60).

* %s    is replaced by the number of seconds since the Epoch, UTC (see mktime(3)).

* %T    is equivalent to ``%H:%M:%S''.

* %u    is replaced by the weekday (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (1-7).

* %V    is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (01-53).  If the week containing January 1 has four or more days in the new year, then it is week 1; otherwise it is the last week of the previous year, and the next week is week 1.

* %v    is equivalent to ``%e-%b-%Y''.

* %W    is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).

* %w    is replaced by the weekday (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (0-6).

* %Y    is replaced by the year with century as a decimal number.

* %y    is replaced by the year without century as a decimal number (00-99).

* %Z    is replaced by the time zone name.

* %z    is replaced by the time zone offset from UTC; a leading plus sign stands for east of UTC, a minus sign for west of UTC, hours and minutes follow with two digits each and no delimiter between them (common form for RFC 822 date headers).

* %+    is replaced by national representation of the date and time (the format is similar to that produced by date(1)).

* %%    is replaced by `%'.

From the examples above, you should be able to format the date / clock system to your own needs.

=== Time Zones ===

If you have friends scattered across time zones, I would suggest you add <nowiki>[[http://www.timeanddate.com/ | date and time]]</nowiki> to your bookmarks. You will see it used when giving a link for meetings etc.
