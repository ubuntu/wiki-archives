=== Introduction ===
<nowiki>[[http://www.lyx.org/|LyX]]</nowiki> is a WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) LaTeX word processor. It behaves more like a word processor than a LaTeX plain text editor, but it is not quite the same as using Open``Office or Abi``Word. A knowledge of LaTeX is not strictly required, but it may be beneficial.
'''NOTE:''' You need to have <code>Universe</code> repositories enabled. Please read <nowiki>[[Repositories]]</nowiki> for further information concerning repositories and installation.

=== Installation ===
LyX can be installed via Synaptic, Adept, or apt-get. For this tutorial we will use the terminal/command line. At the command line, issue the following command:
{{{
}}}

=== Post Installation ===
If LyX does not make it into your gnome menu, then it can be started with from the Run Application dialog (Alt+F2), by typing <code>lyx</code> and pressing return.

If you want to see your math symbols instead of red text, also install the <code>latex-xft-fonts</code> package.

=== Add on packages ===
There are various  packages in the repositories which can add functionality to LyX.
* <code>latex2html</code> allows lyx to produce html output.
* <code>foiltex</code> is useful for making presentations.
After installing such packages you should reconfigure ( goto Edit -> Reconfigure) and then restart LyX.
