__TOC__

You can install Lubuntu onto any installed version of Ubuntu. This will give you the option on boot, or logging out to choose which system to use. 

Launch your <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal| terminal]]</nowiki> and copy the commands to the command line one at a time:
<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lubuntu-desktop</pre>

or 

<pre>
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends lubuntu-desktop</pre>

if you want a lighter installation.

=== Removing other X/K/Ubuntu components after upgrading to Lubuntu ===

Adding Lubuntu to your system will keep all the applications from your existing system. 

This will not delete any of your own data from those applications. If you later wish to re-add them, your data will be there waiting for you.
