=== Workarounds ===

==== Video Tearing ====
Tearing occurs when your video player (mplayer-gnome or VLC) doesn't output video correctly.  For example, in a moving image, the upper part of the image will appear cut away from the lower part.  For example <nowiki>[[http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg695/scaled.php?server=695&filename=tearingsimulated.png&res=medium|this image.]]</nowiki>

Fix for gnome-mplayer:  (tested in 11.10 and later releases) 
# Open Gnome Mplayer
# Open Preferences from Mplayer's menu
# On the Player tab, adjust Video Output to 'GL' (use drop-down menu)

Fix for VLC: (tested in 12.10)
# Open preferences from the 'Tools' menu
# On the video tab, uncheck "Accelerated video output (Overlay)"
# Set Output to "Default"
# Restart VLC
