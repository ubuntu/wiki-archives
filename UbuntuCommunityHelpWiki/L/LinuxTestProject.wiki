== LTP - the Linux Test Project ==
The Linux Test Project is "a joint project started by SGI™ and maintained by IBM®, that has a goal to deliver test suites to the open source community that validate the reliability, robustness, and stability of Linux. The LTP testsuite contains a collection of tools for testing the Linux kernel and related features."

=== Installation ===
The ltp packages have been in the Universe repository since Dapper Drake, so you just need to run '''sudo aptitude install ltp''' to get it. This will also install ltp-commands-test, ltp-tools, ltp-kernel-test, ltp-network-test and ltp-misc-test. Strangely, you have to install ltp-disk-test separately.

=== Usage ===
In a terminal, run '''sudo ltpmenu''', which gives you an ncurses-based interface for the tests...

=== Websites ===
The main website is  <nowiki>[[http://www.linuxtestproject.org/|here]]</nowiki> while the sourceforge website is <nowiki>[[http://ltp.sourceforge.net/|here]]</nowiki>
