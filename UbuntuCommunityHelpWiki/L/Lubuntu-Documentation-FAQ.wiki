== FAQs ==

=== Introduction ===

We tend to get recurring questions regarding common issues with Lubuntu.  This FAQ area tries to offer some solutions to them. There are two areas, but splitting them is a hard call, so please do check both.

=== Work Arounds ===
<nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/FAQ/Workarounds | Work Arounds]]</nowiki>, which deal with live bugs that are under investigation but yet to be fixed along with some of the 'paper-cuts' (minor bugs on the list to be fixed). This section also includes fixing bugs in older versions of Lubuntu. 
----
=== Guides ===
<nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/FAQ/Guides | Guides]]</nowiki>, which deal with some 'tweaking' of Lubuntu for those who want, or need, to fine tune their Lubuntu for themselves.
