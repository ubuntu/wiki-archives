Last.fm is a music service & social media network that learns what kinds of music you like.  From that, it suggests new music and creates an ad-free, customized internet radio station according to your tastes.  You can listen to your station by using the <nowiki>[[http://last.fm|Last.fm Website]]</nowiki>, the Last.fm scrobbler, or through several different media players, such as Rhythmbox, XMMS, Noatun, and more.

=== Plugins ===
Last.fm offers several free "extras" that are built by its users.

For a full list of these extras, see the <nowiki>[[http://build.last.fm|Last.fm plugins page]]</nowiki>

== Firefox ==
Using Firefox, you can create your own radio stations.

<nowiki>[[http://www.last.fm/radio/]]</nowiki> search for bands you like.
This will then create a radio station that plays these bands, and similar tunes.

Firefox can also launch the player when it encounters <code>lastfm:</code> links.
