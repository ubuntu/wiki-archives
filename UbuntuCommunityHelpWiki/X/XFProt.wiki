<nowiki>[[http://www.f-prot.com/products/home_use/linux/|F-Prot for Linux]]</nowiki> is a free command line antivirus scanner. A couple of frontends have been written to go with it, providing more user-friendly GUIs (e.g. <nowiki>[[http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=10381|QtFProt]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://web.tiscali.it/sharp/xfprot|XFprot]]</nowiki>). F-Prot and QtFprot can be downloaded using Synaptic/Adept. XFProt can be downloaded from <nowiki>[[http://web.tiscali.it/sharp/xfprot|the developer's web site]]</nowiki>.

== The Problem ==

We compile XFProt

{{{
 tar -zxvf xfprot-xx.tar.gz     (xx being the file version we downloaded) 
sudo ./configure 
sudo make 
sudo make install (or checkinstall) }}}

and then try to launch the program by typing 

<code> xfprot </code>

in the command line, at which point we get the following error message:

{{{
 xfprot: starting...
xfprot: process is not dumpable
xfprot: private dir found
xfprot: good...private dir is not a link
xfprot: set_dir_properties_and_cd_in()
xfprot: setting permissions of private dir to 0700
xfprot: setting owner of private dir
xfprot: chdir to private dir
xfprot: check_for_bin()
xfprot: access(): /usr/local/f-prot/f-prot: No such file or directory
xfprot: dialog_window() }}}

and

{{{
 /usr/local/f-prot/f-prot
File not found!
Aborting... }}}

== The Reason ==

Ubuntu installs F-Prot for Linux by default in '''/usr/lib/f-prot/''' but XFProt looks for it in '''/usr/local/f-prot'''

== The Solution ==

Create a symbolic link:

<code> sudo ln -s /usr/lib/f-prot/ /usr/local </code>

and try again

<code> sudo  xfprot </code>

(NB Run it as  superuser if you want the scan engine to have access to restricted folders during the analysis)

Hope it works for you!
