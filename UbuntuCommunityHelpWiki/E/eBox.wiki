__TOC__



== Introduction ==

This guide covers installation and configuration of '''eBox''' (currently renamed to '''Zentyal''').  <nowiki>[[Zentyal]]</nowiki> is a web framework used to manage server application configuration.  The modular design of Zentyal allows you to pick and choose which services you want to configure using Zentyal.

The official Zentyal website provides directions for <nowiki>[[http://trac.zentyal.org/wiki/Document/Documentation/InstallationGuide#Zentyal2.0packages|installing directly from their PPA.]]</nowiki> (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zentyal/2.0) eBox version 1.5 is the development branch for use with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx). On September 2010 it was renamed as Zentyal with the release of the 2.0 version.

== Older Versions ==

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> '''WARNING:''' the eBox package released with Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) is broken and cannot be installed. See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ebox/+bug/255368|bug #255368]]</nowiki> for information and unsupported workarounds.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> '''WARNING:''' the eBox version released with Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) has several bugs that severely limit its usefulness.  The eBox version released for Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) is much more functional.

== Installation ==

The '''ebox''' package can be installed from the Universe repository.  See InstallingSoftware for detailed instructions using package managers.  The different eBox modules are split into different packages, allowing you to only install those necessary.  One way to view the available packages is, from a terminal enter:

<pre>
apt-cache rdepends ebox | uniq
</pre>

You can install all eBox packages by running:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install “^ebox-.*” 
</pre>

During the installation you will be asked to supply a password for the '''ebox''' user.  After installing eBox the web interface can be accessed from: <code>https://yourserver/ebox</code>. 

=== Using the latest version ===

To install a newer version of eBox or Zentyal than is included in Ubuntu's repositories add to the file /etc/apt/sources.list this line if you are using Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron):

<pre>
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ebox/1.4/ubuntu hardy main 
</pre>

Or this one if you are using Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx):

<pre>
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/zentyal/2.0/ubuntu lucid main 
</pre>

Be sure to run

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
</pre>

before installing it.

== eBox Configuration ==

An important thing to remember when using '''eBox''' is that when configuring most modules there is a '''Change''' button that implements the new configuration.  After clicking the change button most, but not all, modules will then need to be '''Saved'''.  To save the new configuration click on the '''Save changes''' link in the top right hand corner.  Once you make a change that requires a save the link will change from '''green''' to '''red'''.

=== eBox Modules ===

By default all '''eBox Modules''' are not enabled, and when a new module is installed it will not be automatically enabled.

To enable a disabled '''module''' click on the ''Module status'' link in the left had menu.  Then check which modules you would like to enable and click the ''Save'' link.

=== Default Modules ===

This section provides a quick summary of the default eBox modules.  

* '''System:''' contains options allowing configuration of general eBox items.
** '''General:''' allows you to set the eBox language and port number.  Also, contains a change password form.
