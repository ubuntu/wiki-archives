== 11.10 to 12.04 (Oneiric to Precise) ==

=== Before you start ===

Please make sure you've read and understood the <nowiki>[[EOLUpgrades| main EOLUpgrade page]]</nowiki>.

I would recommend using <nowiki>[[http://www.clonezilla.org| clonezilla]]</nowiki> for backing up your current installation. It is very easy to backup and restore your partitions with clonezilla. It takes less then 30 minutes to backup/restore a 20Gb root filesystem which has 4-5 Gb used space.

=== The upgrade ===

* Please make sure you have the following sources.list (/etc/apt/sources.list).
 <pre>
# # EOL upgrade sources.list
# Required
 deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric main restricted universe multiverse
 deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-updates main restricted universe multiverse
 deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-security main restricted universe multiverse
 </pre>

 You can make use of -backports, -proposed repositories if you want.
 For more information about repositories see <nowiki>[[Repositories-Ubuntu]]</nowiki>.

* Update the package list and upgrade all the installed packages
 <pre>
 sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
 </pre>

* Perform the release upgrade.

 <pre>
 sudo do-release-upgrade
 </pre>

* Check your new version
 Reboot your machine and you can now run `lsb_release -a` to check the new version of Ubuntu.
