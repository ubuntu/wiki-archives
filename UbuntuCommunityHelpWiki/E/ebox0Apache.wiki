Connecting your apache to ebox is very easy and nice.
Here is a config that will allow users coming from the ip-range 192.168.0.0, but demand user and password for everbody else.
It will use ebox ldap for verifying the users.

First set upp Apache to use ldap auth. Install the ldap mod and make shure that Apache is using ldap in the mods-enabled folder.
