== Eye of GNOME ==

Eye of GNOME, or EoG, is Ubuntu's default image viewer.  When you open a photo, EoG lets you perform simple tasks like zooming in and out, rotating the picture and showing slideshows. While applications like gThumb and F-Spot are more suited to organising your image collection, EoG provides everything you need to simply enjoy your photos one at a time.

Eye of GNOME will start when you double-click an image file. If you want to start EoG without opening a file, press the <code>Alt</code> and <code>F2</code> buttons on the keyboard simultaneously and type <code>eog</code> in the window that appears, or open a Terminal and type:

<pre>
eog
</pre>
