Redmine is a nice project and tracking tool.
I use it all the time with ebox.

=== Set up ldap with redmine ===
In redmine go to administration -> ldap auth.
Make a new ldap connection and enter the following

* name = ebox
* host = ip to you ebox
* Port = 389
* Account = Blank
* Password = Blank
* Base DN = ou=Users,dc=elino,dc=se ( change dc=elino,dc=se with your ldap base )
* On the fly creation = yes 
* Login = uid
* Firstname = givenName
* Lastname = sn
* Email = uid ( if you are using mail in you ebox you can change this to "email"

So that should do the config. As soon as a user logs in to redmine with their ldap config, a new redmine user will be created. And after that you can give the user access to projects.
