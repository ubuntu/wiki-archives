== Ubuntu on the EeePC ==
The Asus EeePC is a family of popular low cost ultra portable notebook computers, or "subnotebooks".

To install Ubuntu on an Asus EeePC in its stock form, you will have to create a USB based bootable installer or use a USB-connected CD-ROM drive to run/install Ubuntu. In addition to this, a few simple software modifications may have to be completed for hardware support depending on your EeePC model.

This documentation has been divided up in to three main sections:
* <nowiki>[[EeePC-Installation|Installing Ubuntu - recommended installation settings]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[EeePC-Fixes|Fixing Ubuntu - modifications required for hardware support]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[EeePC-Using|Using & Tweaking Ubuntu - extra tips and optimisations]]</nowiki>

== Custom Distributions ==
There are several splinter distributions customized for the eeepc, which offer built in support for all the tweaks and drivers necessary to use Ubuntu on the EeePC.  <nowiki>[[http://www.array.org/ubuntu/|  Array.org]]</nowiki> has a listing of several of the distributions (along with the customized kernel that those distros use).
