== Evince Document Viewer ==

Evince is the default document viewer for PDF (Portable Document Format) and Post''''''Script files but can also display other formats, such as images.

It is designed to make reading documents a simple and hassle-free experience, and has intuitive previewing, indexing and searching capabilities. You can even view documents in full-screen or presentation format, where each page is displayed like a slide in a slideshow.

Evince will start when you double-click a PDF file. If you want to start Evince without opening a file, press the <code>Alt</code> and <code>F2</code> buttons on the keyboard simultaneously and type <code>evince</code> in the window that appears, or open a Terminal and type:

<pre>
evince
</pre>

== Key Features ==

* Zoom in and out of documents

* Search

* Presentation mode
 
* It can be used from any application bo preview printing and select printing options (you must use "print to a file" in the application and later open the file with Evince to print it).
