Frequently Asked Questions for <nowiki>[[Ekiga]]</nowiki> telephony software

=== How do I get a free SIP address? ===

At step 3 of 10 in the druid, you'll be asked for your Username and Password. You get them by registering in <nowiki>[[http://ekiga.net|ekiga.net]]</nowiki>. This will gives you a free SIP address. Choose your username with care since you will be giving it out to your contacts. A SIP address is a way to be reachable and to reach people. You can compare it to an e-mail address.

<nowiki>[[http://wiki.ekiga.org/index.php/Troubleshooting#Unable_to_register_to_ekiga.net_.3F|Please avoid specials characters for your password.]]</nowiki> Letters and numbers will do just fine.

<nowiki>[[File:Ekiga/Capture-FirstTimeConfigurationAssistant3.png]]</nowiki>

Just follow the link given in the dialog to get an account if you do not have one, then ﬁll in your username and password. 

Your address will be '''<code>sip:Username@ekiga.net</code>'''

Please press ’Forward’ after having entered all required information to continue. 

=== How do I place a call ? ===

When you're done with the druid and have an account on <nowiki>[[http://ekiga.net|ekiga.net]]</nowiki>, you can call the echo test: <code>sip:500@ekiga.net</code> You'll be able to check whether you can reach the service (the SIP network), whether your sound setup is ok (you can hear yourself '''with a delay''') and whether your webcam works (you can see yourself).

If you know the SIP address of the party you wish to call, you may enter that adress into the '''sip: input box''' at the top of the screen and press the Connect button; eg: <code>sip:foo@ekiga.net</code> and pressing the Connect button would call the user at that address.

=== Can I use several SIP addresses ? ===
Yes. First you have to register to the provider (e.g. ekiga.net). Then to add your new sip:address, go to menu '''Edit -> Accounts -> Add'''

|}

=== How do I test the Ekiga service? ===

Once you're registered to http://ekiga.net, you can test your setup and line quality by dialing the echo service: <code>sip:500@ekiga.net</code>

This service only works with <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.711|PCMU]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilbc|iLBC]]</nowiki> audio codecs, and the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.261|H.261]]</nowiki> video codec.

The test service begins with a voice explaining what will happen, then the echo test begins. The echo test is both an audio and a video echo function, so when this is running, you can choose to see local video from your camera or remote video from the remote machine's echo signal.

=== How do I join an audio conference? ===

If you are using ekiga.net as your VoIP provider, you can access a conference server via the aliases

* <code>sip:501@ekiga.net</code> to join the public conference room
* <code>sip:501XXXX@ekiga.net</code> where XXXX is the number of your choice representing the number of the room. 

[For example, a group of friends could meet in conference room 1122 by dialing <code>sip:5011122@ekiga.net</code>]

Using 501xxxx, you'll be asked for a "PIN number": dialing a number you can protect the access to your conference room or just dialing # will make this conference public.

=== How do I call other SIP providers (peering)? ===

Peering is the term given to agreement between VoIP Service Providers which enables the users of one service to call users of another.

This is usually implemented by dialing a special prefix number and then the number of the receipitant (on the 'other' service). 

With Ekiga.net, you can use <nowiki>[[http://www.sipbroker.com/sipbroker/action/providerWhitePages|SipBroker prefixes]]</nowiki>.

Here are some examples of prefixes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Prefix
| Registrar
| Description
|-
| *282
| sip.broadvoice.com
| Broadvoice, do not work actually (2007 july)
|-
| *747
| proxy01.sipphone.com
| Gizmo/SIPPhone
|-
| *393
| fwd.pulver.com
| Freeworlddialup
|-
| *534

| Voipbuster
|-
| *551
| sip.internetcalls.com
| internetcalls
|-
| *248
| voip.wengo.fr

|}

You can also use the special prefix *013 to place a call using <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_Number_Mapping|Enum]]</nowiki>. As prefixes do not have a standard, Enum tries to solve this situation.
