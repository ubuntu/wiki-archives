== Building your own Coyote Linux Router ==

Download Coyote Linux 2.24 (or later) from Vortech Consulting. This
package contains the Linux Floppy Builder scripts for Coyote
Linux. You need a functioning Linux system to use this package.

   http://www.coyotelinux.com/

Check the sum of the download with the command:
<pre>
md5sum Desktop/coyote-2.24.tar.gz
</pre>
(As of 2006.03.18, the checksum is currently: '''a48561b0ff936dff08f5000d870cfafa''')

Unpack this as root!  It attempts to create device nodes and gets upset when it cannot.

If one of your Network Interface Cards (NIC's) is slower than the other, connect the router's SLOWER NIC to the ethernet and the onboard faster NIC to the server.

Now, make a floppy image of the floppy you just built.

<pre>
ddrescue /dev/sda coyote.img
</pre>

If all goes well, you get an ASCII coyote when you boot from the floppy.  Username "root" and no password gets you in. '''ip addr''' should reveal two ethernet connections, one of which will have the address '''192.168.0.1''', and the other will be a "real" address, probably(?) assigned by a DHCP server.

Connect the Coyote Router's LAN (whichever Ethernet port was assigned the IP address '''192.168.0.1''') to the switch and connect the server to the switch.  (In my case the switch is a Netgear FS108 Fast Ethernet Switch, the router goes into port 8, labeled "Link / FDX", and the server goes into port 7.)
