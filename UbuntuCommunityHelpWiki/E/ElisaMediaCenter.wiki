More information can be found on the <nowiki>[[http://elisa.fluendo.com/|Elisa home page]]</nowiki>.

'' The current recommended version of Elisa is 0.3.5. ''

=== Installing Elisa on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) or 7.10 (Gutsy) ===

Elisa can be found in the Ubuntu software repositories. To install it:

* Select Add/Remove from the Applications menu.
* Elisa Media Center can be found in the Sound & Video section, or by using the search box.
* Click the check box next to the Elisa Media Centre entry and click the Apply Changes button (in the bottom left hand corner).

=== Configuring Elisa ===

==== Specifying media locations ====

Elisa should automatically find your media locations on its own. If it doesn't you can easily drag'n'drop folders from your file manager into the elisa window. They should appear in the UI of elisa after restarting elisa. If they do not, you might need to setup them up manually.

===== Manual setup =====

Usually elisa should automatically find your media locations and show them in the submenus under 'Folders' on its own. Anyway if it doesn't or the directory is not accessible you can also add other locations, that should appear in elisa. For that you simply have edit the configuration file (if you run it without given a certain one, its path is ~/.elisa/elisa.conf). There is a locations_builder-section. It looks like that:

<pre>
[xmlmenu:locations_builder]
locations = []
auto_locations = 1
</pre>

In this "locations" option, you can add your uris, like 'file:///home/ben/media/videos'. Don't forget to add a comma (',') between them. Then for example, it looks like this:

<pre>
[xmlmenu:locations_builder]
locations = ['file:///home/ben/media/videos', 'file:///media/videos']
auto_locations = 1
</pre>

You can also disable the automatic lookup of media directories by setting the auto_locations value to 0. If you have more than one uri, with the same ending, you probably want them to be named differently. To do that, you need to set up a sub-section called the same as the uri itself and you can add some other parameters like this:

<pre>
<nowiki>[[file:///home/ben/media/videos]]</nowiki>
label = 'Home Videos'
only_media = ['video']
location_type = 'local'
</pre>

*** the label is simply setting the label,
*** the only_media let it only show up in the listed main-menu entries (currently there is 'video', 'audio', 'image').
*** the location_type is the sub-directory where it shows up, like 'local' (for Folders) or 'internet' to show up under the Internet-Submenu in elisa.

==== Full screen mode ====

Elisa opens in full screen mode by default. To disable this feature:

* Open the Elisa configuration file. This is called elisa.conf and can be found in the .elisa directory in your home directory.
* Find the line that reads 'start_fullscreen = '1''.
* Change the 1 to 0.

=== Using Elisa ===

==== Starting Elisa ====

Elisa can be started through the Elisa Media Center icon found in the Sound & Video section of the Applications menu.

==== Controls ====

Elisa can be operated by mouse, keyboard, or remote control.

=== Problems ===

Problems playing video and other media in Elisa are often the result of not having the necessary media framework components installed. For more help with this, refer to the <nowiki>[[RestrictedFormats|Restricted Formats]]</nowiki> page.

Elisa requires something called OpenGL in order to perform to its fullest. Ubuntu will usually automatically set up OpenGL for you, but if it isn't working, Elisa will give you a message telling you. If this happens, the first thing to do is to check that you have the right drivers installed for your graphics hardware. You can find out more on how to do this on the <nowiki>[[RestrictedDrivers|Restricted Drivers]]</nowiki> page.

Bugs can be found and reported on the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/elisa|Elisa Launchpad page]]</nowiki>.
