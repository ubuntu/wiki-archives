=== Setting Up a Local Apt Mirror ===

==== Problem ====

Our school network is behind a firewall that does content filtering on port 80.  I'm not sure
if this is why, but connections are often dropped when running the update manager or
<code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code>.  Additionally, we have dozens of computers which we need to update,
so we wanted a way to do this faster.

==== Solution ====

We decided that a local package mirror was the solution to our problem.  Here is what we did
to create it:

## Choose a local machine with a big enough hard drive (ours is 120 Gig).
## Install Ubuntu on to this machine using the alternate install disk:
*** create a 1 gig swap partition, a 30 gig root partition, and an 89 gig partition mounted on <code>/opt</code>.
*** modify <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> so that it looks like this:<pre>
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-backports main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu feisty-security main restricted universe multiverse</pre>
*** after updating and dist-upgrading, run: <code>apt-get install debmirror apache2</code>
0. Create the mirror by running the following command: <pre>
debmirror /opt/ubuntu-mirror -nosource -v -m --passive --host=us.archive.ubuntu.com --root=:ubuntu --method=rsync --progress --dist=feisty,feisty-security,feisty-updates,feisty-backports --ignore-release-gpg --section=main,restricted,universe,multiverse --arch=i386,amd64</pre>
