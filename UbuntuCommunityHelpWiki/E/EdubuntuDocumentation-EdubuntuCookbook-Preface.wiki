This is the first time the Ubuntu Documentation Project is releasing the Edubuntu Cookbook.

The Edubuntu Cookbook was adapted from the <nowiki>[[http://www.upfrontsystems.co.za/Members/jean/cookbook/docbook/cookbook.html|tuXlab Cookbook]]</nowiki>, written by Jean Jordaan and illustrated by Leonora van Staden for the Shuttleworth Foundation.

Edubuntu is not possible without the global education community. This book we dedicate to all of you!

We also thank all contributors who spent hours of their time developing, reviewing and proofreading this book.
