== 5.04 to 5.10 (Hoary to Breezy) ==

=== Before you start ===

Please make sure you've read and understood the <nowiki>[[EOLUpgrades| main EOLUpgrade page]]</nowiki>.

I would recommend using <nowiki>[[http://www.clonezilla.org| clonezilla]]</nowiki> for backing up your current installation. It is very easy to backup and restore your partitions with clonezilla. It takes less then 30 minutes to backup/restore a 20Gb root filesystem which has 4-5 Gb used space.

=== The upgrade ===

* Make sure your sources.list is correct

For the upgrade you only need this list, comment your original sources or remove them.
<pre>
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hoary main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hoary-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hoary-security main restricted universe multiverse

</pre>

You can make use of -backports, -proposed repositories if you want.
For more information about repositories see <nowiki>[[Repositories-Ubuntu]]</nowiki>.

* Update the package list and upgrade all installed packages
<pre>
sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade
</pre>

If packages were held back you may want to run:

<pre>
sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
</pre>

* If you run a -desktop version of ubuntu, please reinstall this package:
<pre>
sudo aptitude reinstall ubuntu-desktop # or kubuntu, xubuntu, edubuntu, etc
</pre>

NOTE: It could be that you just upgraded your kernel, if this is the case, please reboot!

* Change your repositories
<pre>
$ sudo perl -p -i.504 -e 's/hoary/breezy/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
</pre>

* Update the package list and perform a dist-upgrade

<pre>
sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
</pre>

* Check your new version
Reboot your machine and you can now run `lsb_release -a` to check the new version of Ubuntu.

* Remove obsolete packages
<pre>
sudo aptitude
</pre>

Now you will enter aptitude in interactive mode, select Obsolete and locally installed packages menu and press '_', then press 'g'. It could be that you will get messages that aptitude wants to remove your current kernel, do NOT remove it, leave it, we can remove it later on.
