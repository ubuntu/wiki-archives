== 9.04 to 9.10 (Jaunty to Karmic) using Alternate CD ==

To upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10 using the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades#Upgrades_via_alternate_CD | Alternate CD upgrade method is described here]]</nowiki>.

== 9.04 to 9.10 (Jaunty to Karmic) ==

=== Before you start ===

Please make sure you've read and understood the <nowiki>[[EOLUpgrades| main EOLUpgrade page]]</nowiki>.

I would recommend using <nowiki>[[http://www.clonezilla.org| clonezilla]]</nowiki> for backing up your current installation. It is very easy to backup and restore your partitions with clonezilla. It takes less then 30 minutes to backup/restore a 20Gb root filesystem which has 4-5 Gb used space.

Note that the instructions listed here will '''no longer officially work'''. The `do_release_upgrade` tool will now return this error:

<pre>
An upgrade from 'jaunty' to 'lucid' is not supported with this tool.
</pre>

The alternate official migration path is using the Alternate-CD, more information about why this is the only upgrade now available, please <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/questions/47807/how-do-i-upgrade-from-9-04-to-10-04-2 | see this discussion]]</nowiki>.

'''However a work-around has been proposed''', so for those eager to use the online upgrade facility, it is still possible, <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/a/135028/3004 | an answer on the previous discussion has been proposed]]</nowiki>. It requires a few extra steps before you start with the next chapter.

=== The upgrade ===

* Please make sure you have the following sources.list (/etc/apt/sources.list).
<pre>
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty-security main restricted universe multiverse

</pre>

You can make use of -backports, -proposed repositories if you want.
