=== What are Repositories? ===

There are thousands of programs available to install on Kubuntu. These programs are stored in software archives ('''repositories''') and are available for installation over the Internet. This makes it very easy to install new programs. It is also very secure, because each program you install is thoroughly tested and built specifically for Kubuntu.

The Kubuntu software repository is organized into four "components", on the basis of the level of support Kubuntu can offer them, and whether or not they comply with Ubuntu's (and Kubuntu's) <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/philosophy|Free Software Philosophy]]</nowiki>. The components are called '''Main''' (officially supported software), '''Restricted''' (supported software that is not available under a completely free license), '''Universe''' (community-maintained, i.e. not officially supported software) and '''Multiverse''' (software that is "not free"). You can find more information about the Repositories <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components|here]]</nowiki>.

The Kubuntu ISOs contain software from the '''Main''' and '''Restricted''' components. Once your system is made aware of the Internet-based locations for these repositories, many more software programs are made available for installation. Using the software package management tools already installed on your system, you can search for, install and update any piece of software directly over the Internet, without the need for installation media.

Canonical now maintains a repository which contains commercial software such as Opera and Skype specifically built for Ubuntu. These are however not open source software.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/note.png]]</nowiki> This page describes how to manage software repositories in '''Kubuntu ''' releases. <nowiki>[[Repositories-Ubuntu| This wiki page]]</nowiki> explains how to manage software repositories in '''Ubuntu'''.

=== Managing Repositories in Kubuntu ===

==== Adding Repositories ====

Kubuntu uses Muon for software management. To open it, click on your Kmenu, then open Muon.

Select Source, Configure Software Sources in the window. Enter your administrative password at the prompt.

<nowiki>[[attachment:muondiscover.png|<nowiki>[[File:muondiscover.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

<nowiki>[[attachment:muondiscoverpasswd.png|<nowiki>[[File:muondiscoverpasswd.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

Left-click the 'Other Software' tab.

<nowiki>[[attachment:muondiscoverrepos.png|<nowiki>[[File:muondiscoverrepos.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

Left-click the 'Add...' button.

<nowiki>[[attachment:muondiscoverrepos2.png|<nowiki>[[File:muondiscoverrepos2.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

Enter the repository address into the text box. The proper format is required, and looks similar to this:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/kubuntu-ppa/backports/ubuntu raring main

<nowiki>[[attachment:muondiscoverrepos3.png|<nowiki>[[File:muondiscoverrepos3.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

Left-click the 'OK' button to add the repository.

Left-click the 'Close' button. A prompt will appear to update the package list. Muon will now be allowed to find the newly available software.

===== Commandline method =====

Or, you could just type a line or two of commands and get the job done as follows: (The example shows ppa:kubuntu-ppa , but substitute the PPA you desire and don't type exactly as shown)

su (to become root, or preface each command with sudo)

apt-add-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa

apt-get update

apt-get upgrade

==== Enable a Repository ====

You can use the Muon Software Center to enable repositories.

How-to: Start Muon Software Center. Select Settings, Configure Software Sources in the window. Enter your administrative password at the prompt. Left-click the 'Other Software' tab. Check the appropriate box in the center section of the window to enable a repository. Left-click the 'Close' button. A prompt will appear to update the package list. Muon will now be allowed to find the newly available software.

==== Disable a Repository ====

You can use the Muon Software Center to disable repositories.

How-to: Start Muon Software Center. Select Settings, Configure Software Sources in the window. Enter your administrative password at the prompt. Left-click the 'Other Software' tab. Uncheck the appropriate box in the center section of the window to disable a repository. Left-click the 'Close' button. A prompt will appear to update the package list. Muon will now forget the no longer available software.

==== Remove a Repository ====

You can use the Muon Software Center to remove repositories.

How-to: Start Muon Software Center. Select Settings, Configure Software Sources in the window. Enter your administrative password at the prompt. Left-click the 'Other Software' tab. Left-click the name of an existing repository in the center section of the window to select it. Left-click the 'Remove' button. Left-click the 'Close' button. A prompt will appear to update the package list. Muon will now forget the no longer available software.

=== Additional Unofficial Repositories ===

There is a Kubuntu team <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa|PPA]]</nowiki> which contains several repositories maintained by Kubuntu developers and community members to support testing.  They are:

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/ppa | Kubuntu Updates]]</nowiki> - Updates for Kubuntu releases which are due to go to Ubuntu Updates. Mostly KDE point releases. These are expected to be reasonably safe to use, but are here for testing.  These are intended to eventually go to the official Ubuntu repositories.

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/backports | Backports]]</nowiki> - Backports of new versions of KDE and major KDE apps for Kubuntu which are either too large a change or not yet tested enough to go to Ubuntu Backports.  These are only final releases of major new versions of KDE and related packages.  Generally these can be expected to work, but will often be less mature or less tested than versions in the official repositories for a release.

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/beta | Beta Backports]]</nowiki> - Backports of beta versions of KDE and major KDE apps.  This PPA is only for enthusiasts who want an early look at upcoming releases and are willing to deal with significant breakage and regression.

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/experimental | Experimental]]</nowiki> - Testing ground for unfinished Kubuntu packages.  This PPA is not suitable for routine use.  Only install specific packages from this PPA to support specific testing.  Do not be surprised if something breaks your system.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/note.png]]</nowiki> Working with PPA's can be read <nowiki>[[https://userbase.kde.org/Special:MyLanguage/Kubuntu/Advanced/Repositories | here]]</nowiki> on official Kubuntu documents.
