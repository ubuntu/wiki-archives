There are times when bugs are inherent in the way the package functions & need to be reported upstream.
Upstream may change from package to package depending on from where the package is sourced. Lot of 
Ubuntu packages are sourced from Debian & there is a wonderful package called reportbug which is 
given by them. 

== Installing ==

==== Since 4.10 (Warty Warthog) ====

It's packaged in universe, so installing is easy:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install reportbug
</pre>

==== Initial configuration ====

When you run <code>reportbug</code> for the first time it will create a reportbug.conf file in /etc.
There are quite a few changes one has to do there.

<pre>
sudo gedit /etc/reportbug.conf
</pre>

== Preparing A Bug Report ==

Let's understand reportbug with help of an e.g. using a user 'bob'

{{{
bob@ubuntu:reportbug
Please enter the name of the package in which you have found a problem.
> pidgin
* ** Welcome to reportbug.  Use ? for help at prompts. ***
Detected character set: UTF-8
Please change your locale if this is incorrect.

Using 'bob <bob@ubuntu.com>' as your from address. }}}

The first time you will run it, there would be no bob or anything, 
feel free to add an address here. 

{{{
Getting status for pidgin...
Verifying package integrity...
Will send report to Ubuntu (per request).
Maintainer for pidgin is 'Ubuntu Core Developers
<ubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com>'.
Looking up dependencies of pidgin...

Please briefly describe your problem (you can elaborate in a moment; an empty
response will stop reportbug). This should be a concise summary of what is
wrong with the package, for example, "fails to send email" or "does not start
with -q option specified."
> doesn't like me
Rewriting subject to 'pidgin: doesn't like me' }}}

As told above this is the subject line. 

{{{
How would you rate the severity of this problem or report?

1 critical        makes unrelated software on the system (or the whole system)
                 break, or causes serious data loss, or introduces a security
                 hole on systems where you install the package.
2 grave           makes the package in question unusable by most or all users,
                 or causes data loss, or introduces a security hole allowing
                 access to the accounts of users who use the package.
3 serious         is a severe violation of Debian policy (that is, the problem
                 is a violation of a 'must' or 'required' directive); may or
                 may not affect the usability of the package. Note that non-
                 severe policy violations may be 'normal,' 'minor,' or
                 'wishlist' bugs. (Package maintainers may also designate
                 other bugs as 'serious' and thus release-critical; however,
                 end users should not do so.)
4 important       a bug which has a major effect on the usability of a package,
                 without rendering it completely unusable to everyone.
5 does-not-build  a bug that stops the package from being built from source.
                 (This is a 'virtual severity'.)
6 normal          a bug that does not undermine the usability of the whole
                 package; for example, a problem with a particular option or
                 menu item.
7 minor           things like spelling mistakes and other minor cosmetic errors
                 that do not affect the core functionality of the package.
8 wishlist        suggestions and requests for new features.

Please select a severity level: [normal] 8 }}}

As given above how you rate the seriousness of the bug, this is a trial
and error thing which one comes to know over a period of time. 

{{{
Do any of the following apply to this report? 

1 l10n      This bug reports a localization/internationalization issue.

2 patch     You are including a patch to fix this problem.

3 none 

Please select tags: (one at a time) [none] }}}

This can be important if 

a) The application doesn't put language correctly 
b) There is some issue & you have a part solution to the 
problem.

As can be seen there is a line saying add info. after this line. If you

== Sending the Bug Report ==

Now there are 2 ways one can send the bug-report. One way is to use 
an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent), the other is to copy & paste the above 
report in your mail account & send it to submit@bugs.debian.org

After sometime you will get an acknowledgement from debian something
similar to this.

{{{
		
	 
	from		Debian Bug Tracking System <owner@bugs.debian.org> 		  
	reply-to		429222@bugs.debian.org

	subject		Bug#429222: Acknowledgement (pidgin: doesn't like me)	 
	mailed-by		bugs.debian.org}}}

 Now this bug no. is randomly generated, just like in launchpad. The no. is 
 important as all the transactions for the bug revolve around this bug no.

-- no debconf information}}}

This is the same as before, the only difference is there is no debconf configuration 
because it is not a debian configuration. 

== Following up the bug report ==

The simplest way to follow up the bug report is to go to http://bugs.debian.org/XXXXX
where the XXXXX is changed by the bug number given in the acknowledgement e-mail. 

So it will be http://bugs.debian.org/429222 for following up on the bug. 

==== Adding, subscribing and closing bugs ====

To add new info. to the bug send a mail with the bug no. XXXXX@bugs.debian.org:-
from above 429222@bugs.debian.org

To subscribe to the bug to know what action is taken do mail with:-
429222-subscribe@bugs.debian.org

To close the bug the same convention follows :-
429222-done@bugs.debian.org

Each action would need to be confirmed by a separate e-mail sent by debian for all the above.
