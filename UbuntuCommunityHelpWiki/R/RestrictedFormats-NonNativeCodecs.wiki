== Playing non-native media formats under Linux ==

There are a few formats such as certain Windows formats, Real, and Apple Quicktime which do not have native codecs under Linux. To work around this issue, external binary codecs are used instead to play these formats. <nowiki>[[http://www.mplayerhq.hu/|MPlayer]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://xinehq.de/|xine]]</nowiki> use such external codecs and these codecs are stored in the MPlayer website in their <nowiki>[[http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/|codecs directory]]</nowiki>.
