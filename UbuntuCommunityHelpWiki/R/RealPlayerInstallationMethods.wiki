=== Installing RealPlayer11 ===

!RealPlayer installation method depending by version of Ubuntu that you use.

==== Installing on Ubuntu 10.10 & Later ====

RealPlayer is no longer officially supported by Real. Archived copies are available via the <nowiki>[[https://player.helixcommunity.org/2005/downloads/|Helix Community]]</nowiki>. Only the 32-bit version is listed on the site and is an RPM package. 

The RealPlayer11GOLD.deb file may be available as an archive on 3rd party websites. The version available in Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid is still contained in the Medibuntu repositories and can be downloaded <nowiki>[[http://packages.medibuntu.org/lucid/realplayer.html|from this site]]</nowiki>

==== Installing on Ubuntu 10.04 ====
===== 32 bit =====

!RealPlayer is available through the <nowiki>[[http://www.medibuntu.org/|Medibuntu]]</nowiki> ''non-free'' repository for Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid) and earlier. 

* See instruction for adding <nowiki>[[Medibuntu|Medibuntu]]</nowiki> repository.
* Install ''realplayer'' packages in any method.

===== 64 bit =====

The ''realplayer'' version in the Medibuntu repositories is 64-bit compatible. Several 32-bit libraries will be installed as dependencies.

=== Running RealPlayer ===

!RealPlayer can be started via ''Applications > Sound & Video > !RealPlayer11'' or via the ''Terminal'' by typing: <pre>
realplayer
</pre> or <pre>
realplay
</pre>

=== Start file with RealPlayer ===

External Protocol Handling: As a standalone player, the default Ubuntu settings may start Totem when a !RealPlayer file is selected (''.ra, .rm, .rv, .ram, .smil'', etc.). If these files are not opened with !RealPlayer, the application may start and then crash or close. 

To change the default to !RealPlayer:
* Right click on the file.
* Select ''Properties > Open With'' and then ''!RealPlayer''. 
* If it is not a choice, select ''Open with Other Application'' and select it.

If not listed, expand ''Use custom command'' and the ''Browse'' button to point it to the !RealPlayer run file. By default, this is ''/usr/bin/realplayer''. If not installed from the Medibuntu repositories, the location may be ''/opt/real/RealPlayer''.

=== Firefox Plugin ===

The !RealPlayer Firefox plugin will be created with the instruction above. The plugin files are ''nphelix.so'' and ''nphelix.xpt''.

If you want set Firefox to play RealAudio/Video Files:
* Open Firefox
* Click Edit > Preferences
* Go to Applications label
* Scroll to ''RA files'' or ''!RealAudio Document''.
* In the ''Action'' column, click the enabled action (such as ''Always ask'').
* Select ''Use realplay''  or ''Use other'' and browse to the ''realplay'' run file.

If Firefox will not open RealAudio/Video files:
* Check the !RealPlayer plugin installation and location. 
* Restart Firefox. 
* From the Firefox menu, select ''Edit > Preferences: Plugins''. You should see the !RealPlayer plugin named as as Helix DNA Plugin: RealPlayer G2 Plug-In Compatible
* It the plugin isn't listed, investigate further by accomplishing the following: 
** Set Firefox to display the full plugin path when the ''about:plugins'' feature is used: 
** Type '''''about:config''''' in the Firefox address bar and acknowledge the warning. 
** Type '''''plugin''''' in the ''Filter'' field. 
** Find ''plugin.expose_full_path''. Double click to change the value to '''''true'''''.
* Type '''''about:plugins''''' in the Firefox address bar.  
** Find the !RealPlayer plugin.
** Ensure the plugin references nphelix.so. If it points to a ''totem'' file, note the location and remove or rename that file.

Make Firefox use !RealPlayer for rtsp streams embedded in web page links:

* Close Firefox and open the gconf editor from the Applications menu: <pre>
gconf-editor /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/rtsp }}}
* Check the value for "command" - it will probably read ''totem "%s"''. Change the entry to read '''''realplay "%s"''''' and then close gconf editor. 
* Note: Firefox will only evaluate the mime types that the plugin supports either when such plugin is updated or when $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/pluginreg.dat is missing. To update the mime-types: {{{
sudo touch /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/mplayerplug-in.so  # If this file exists.
rm $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/pluginreg.dat  # If this file exists.
</pre>

=== Uninstalling ===
==== Removing .deb installs ====

Uninstall ''realplayer'' packages in any methods.

==== Removing .bin installs ====

* Run the following command: <pre>
sudo /opt/real/RealPlayer/postinst/postuninst.sh
</pre>
* Once this script has been run it is safe to remove the ''/opt/real'' folder and subfolders.
* If the package was installed in another folder, run the ''postuninst.sh'' script from that folder.

=== Troubleshooting ===
==== RealPlayer won't start ====

* If !RealPlayer won't start, make sure that a symbolic link of the ''realplay'' start-up script is in your system path. 
* To check, run this command in ''Terminal'': <pre>
which realplay
/usr/bin/realplay
</pre>
* If it is not, the user will need to enter the full path to ''realplayer'' when the command is run or entered into scripts. If the !RealPlayer startup script (''realplay'') is not located in ''/usr/bin'' or ''/usr/local/bin'', create a symbolic link so the startup script will be located by the system. 
* The following example is for a !RealPlayer installation into the ''/opt/real/Realplayer'' folder. If !RealPlayer was installed in another folder, change ''/opt/real/RealPlayer'' to reflect the actual location: <pre>
sudo ln -s /opt/real/RealPlayer/realplay /usr/local/bin
</pre>

==== MPlayer plugin conflicts (if installed) ====
* To prevent the MPlayer plugin from playing RealAudio/Video files, edit the plugin configuration file ''~/.mplayer/mplayerplug-in.conf'' and change or add the following three lines:
