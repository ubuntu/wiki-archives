__TOC__

repro is the SIP proxy from the <nowiki>[[http://www.resiprocate.org|reSIProcate]]</nowiki> project.

It has the following key features that make it highly desirable as the core SIP server in any Ubuntu VoIP/RTC deployment:
* out-of-the-box support for <nowiki>[[http://www.federatedvoip.org|Federated VoIP]]</nowiki>
* an easy to use web-interface (see <nowiki>[[http://www.rtcquickstart.org/sip-proxy-installation/repro|screenshots]]</nowiki>)
* support for mutual TLS authentication - <nowiki>[[http://www.resiprocate.org/ReproMutualTLSAuthenticationJitsi|guide to setting up mutual-TLS (client certificate) authentication with Jitsi]]</nowiki>

To get support with repro on Ubuntu, users are welcome to come and ask questions on the <nowiki>[[http://list.resiprocate.org/mailman/listinfo/repro-users|repro-users mailing list]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/resiprocate|Current Ubuntu package information summary]]</nowiki>

WebRTC support is expected in v1.9.0 of repro.
