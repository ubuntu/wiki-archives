==== Plugins ====
Given that this machine is a backend and frontend, the mythplugins metapackage can be used.  This will install all of the misc. mythtv plugins available as well as dependencies.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install mythplugins
</pre>

This will properly install apache2 and php4 for mythweb.  If you would like to use php5 instead, install it prior to installing mythweb.  All of the plugins will work out of the box except for mythweb.
