== isohybrid ==

Cloning an iso file to a mass storage device makes a boot drive, provided it is a hybrid iso file, post-processed with isohybrid.

=== Installing isohybrid ===

If the program '''isohybrid''' is not found, you can install it with the following program packages

* in 14.04 'Trusty' the package containing isohybrid is '''syslinux'''
* in 15.04 'Vivid' and newer versions, isohybrid is in the package '''syslinux-utils'''

<pre>
sudo apt-get install syslinux
sudo apt-get install syslinux-utils
</pre>

=== Using isohybrid ===

Example:
<pre>
cp -p filename.iso filename-hybrid.iso

isohybrid filename-hybrid.iso
</pre>

See the manual file for more details,
<pre>
man isohybrid
</pre>

=== Wait ===

'''Wait, don't do this automatically and at once!''' Isohybrid should be run only once, and many iso files are already treated before uploading to the internet. The Ubuntu iso files are already treated with isohybrid. Use isohybrid only, if the USB drive does not boot after cloning or installing live-only using mkusb.
