== Frontend & Regular Desktop ==
A frontend machine with a desktop is typically a regularly-used or extra machine that won't necessarily be used exclusively for frontend use.  If you want a computer that can function as a frontend, but also offer the capabilities of a full ubuntu installation- or if you are adding frontend functionality to your existing desktop, then this is likely your choice of installations.
