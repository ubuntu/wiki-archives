== MacBook Pro 8,3 (2011 Macbook Pro) Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) ==
<<BR>>

This page is a stub for beginning work on describing the process of getting a 2011 MacBookPro working in Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat.

This work is derived from the page that describes setup for the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro8-1/Natty|8,1 MacBook Pro]]</nowiki>.

Please note that before going through any of the suggested fixes for this hardware, or installing any additional drivers, please make sure you '''RUN UPDATE MANAGER''' first and apply all updates to the system.

You can find out what model you have by typing at the terminal:<<BR>>
<pre>
sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name
</pre>
If you have a different model, please go <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages|here]]</nowiki> and find the right wiki.

=== Overview ===

As of this writing, very little of the extended hardware in the MBP appears to function correctly in Ubuntu. Below is a list/overview of the features of the MacBook Pro and their alleged status.

=== Sensors ===

The program lmsensors detects the sensors, however it does not know what they are yet. But coretemp will allow lm-sensor to detect the others sensors, the rotation speed of the fan and the GPU temperature.
<pre>
sudo modprobe coretemp
</pre>
Then add '''coretemp''' to the list of modules loaded during the boot process:
<pre>
sudo gedit /etc/modules
</pre>

It is highly recommended (why?) to use the fan controller daemon that is included in the mactel-support ppa called macfanctl. After enabling the ppa as shown above you can add this tool with the following command:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install macfanctld
</pre>

After installation you there is a config file located at /etc/macfanctl.conf. The default configurations seems to work well.

=== Suspend ===

works fine out-of-the-box
=== Screen ===

needs docs

=== Colors ===

needs docs

=== Reboot ===

needs docs

=== Video ===

'''AMD Radeon HD 6750M'''

The ATI driver (under "Additional Drivers") seems to work but displays an overlay image in the bottom right corner saying: "Unsupported hardware"

=== HFS+ ===

HFS is mounted as Read-Only

=== CDDVD ===

works fine out-of-the-box

=== Bluetooth ===

btusb driver is missing device id for Bluetooth device.  Package from this forum post fixes it: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=10561399&postcount=102]]</nowiki>

=== Keyboard ===

The package "pommed" does not support it, yet. We have to wait for version 1.38:
<nowiki>[[http://blog.technologeek.org/2011/03/19/470]]</nowiki>. It also requires a more recent kernel.

I was able to manually set the keyboard backlight:
<pre>
echo 100 > /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness
</pre>

=== Touchpad ===

It's only recognized as a normal touchpad but you cannot configure it.

=== FireWire ===

needs docs

=== Battery ===

needs docs

=== Ethernet ===

Works without any special configuration.
=== Wireless ===

Some people reported it works with ndiswrapper. I just had it working once - after reboot, I never was able to connect to a network. More details
<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1695746&page=2|this thread]]</nowiki>

It works on 64bit, but for some reason can’t reestablish a connection after suspend.

=== Webcam ===

The new FaceTime HD Camera works without any special configuration.

=== CardReader ===

Works with a standard SD card and SDHC card, not tested with SDXC card.

=== Sound ===

Sound is partial out of the box. Mute is on by default and resets to mute from time-to-time. To unmute use an alsa mixer:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer
</pre>

The volume for the front speaker (Front Sp) must be unmuted and turned up.

Right speaker only works and is very low volume. Seems to be full stereo at normal volume with headphones although after a time (with Banshee / Rhythmbox) the audio degrades and turns "electronic" in nature. This is resolved by restarting the audio player in question.

=== Microphone ===

Works out-of-the-box. May need to uncheck mute in the sound preferences.

=== Thunderbolt ===

needs docs

=== ExtMon ===

works out of the box

=== ARC ===
