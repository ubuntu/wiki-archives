=== About MariaDB ===

MariaDB is a fork of MySQL, created and maintained by the original MySQL developers. MariaDB is intended to remain free and is published under <nowiki>[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License|GPLv2]]</nowiki>. It is very similar to MySQL, meaning that most MySQL examples you find online will also work on MariaDB
