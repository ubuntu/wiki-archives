This page holds the instructions for how to answer the questions.

Press Continue.

This section is a little bit complicated. Follow the instructions carefully.

==== Select the bootloader ====

Under "Select the device for bootloader installation", select your primary drive. If you're unsure, it's probably the drive with the EFI System Partition (ESP), e.g. `/dev/sda` or `/dev/nvme0n1`.

==== Select the ESP partition ====

Do you remember which partition holds the ESP (as determined in the <nowiki>[[..-OverviewPartitionPreparation|partition preparation]]</nowiki>? Scroll down the table to that partition. It will have the device name (e.g. `/dev/sda2`) with other details in the remaining columns.

Highlight the line by pressing it.

Press the "Change…" button. if there is no such button, right-click the partition and select "Change".

In the mini window, set "Use as" to "EFI System Partition" (if not already set).

Press OK.

==== Select the remaining partitions ====

Repeat the process for each of the device names in the following table, filling in the details as in the following table.
* In all cases, do '''not''' select the "Format" checkbox.
* The sizes shown in the table below will most likely differ on your system.
* If you aren't using swap, skip the line for swap.
* If you don't have a separate data partition, skip the line for data.
