== Install dus with guidus alias mkusb-dus alias mkusb version 12 from a tarball ==

You can download one of the following tarballs (compressed tar files) and check the md5sum, that it was downloaded correctly. This option is a last alternative, when the other options do not work. The version is/was up to date when uploaded, but it may not be updated as often as the other alternatives, and it is also limited to dus with guidus alias mkusb version 12.

=== Tarballs to download ===

* minimal version '''dus.tar.xz''' (~ 13 M, Mibibytes)
** <nowiki>[[https://github.com/sudodus/tarballs/raw/master/dus.tar.xz]]</nowiki>
* version with usb-pack-efi '''dus-plus.tar.xz''' (~ 24 M, Mibibytes)
** <nowiki>[[https://github.com/sudodus/tarballs/raw/master/dus-plus.tar.xz]]</nowiki>
* signed checksum file '''md5sum-dus-tarballs.txt.asc''' for the two dus-tarballs
** <nowiki>[[https://github.com/sudodus/tarballs/raw/master/md5sum-dus-tarballs.txt.asc]]</nowiki>

==== dus.tar.xz ====

[Left]click on the link, and 'save link as' to get the tarball file. 

The minimal version is enough in most cases, when you want to

* make a standard live drive or installer drive,
* clone a compressed image,
* restore to a standard storage drive and
* wipe a drive (remove all data including the partition table).

==== dus-plus.tar.xz ====

[Left]click on the link, and 'save link as' to get the tarball file. 

Use '''dus-plus.tar.xz''', when you intend to

* make a '''persistent live''' drive, because 'usb-pack-efi' can improve the boot performance of persistent live drives.

==== md5sums ====

The simple check is the run
<pre>
md5sum dus.tar.xz
</pre>
or
<pre>
md5sum dus-plus.tar.xz
</pre>

and compare the result with the corresponding line in the signed checksum file '''md5sum-dus-tarballs.txt.asc'''.

You may want a higher level of security. This file is signed with '''gpg''' and you can verify it according to the following commands. 
<pre>
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EB0FC2C8
gpg --verify md5sum-dus-tarballs.txt.asc 
</pre>
The warning "This key is not certified with a trusted signature! There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner." means that there is no chain of trusted keys between your computer's keyring and the key, that was used to sign the checksums (the key of sudodus). Check that the result matches with the following output, when you verify it,
<pre>
tester@xenial32 ~ $ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EB0FC2C8
gpg: directory `/home/tester/.gnupg' created
gpg: new configuration file `/home/tester/.gnupg/gpg.conf' created
gpg: WARNING: options in `/home/tester/.gnupg/gpg.conf' are not yet active during this run
gpg: keyring `/home/tester/.gnupg/secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `/home/tester/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
gpg: requesting key EB0FC2C8 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com
gpg: /home/tester/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key EB0FC2C8: public key "Nio Sudden Wiklund (sudodus) <address@mailserver.com>" imported
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)

tester@xenial32 ~ $ gpg --verify md5sum-dus-tarballs.txt.asc 
gpg: Signature made ons 25 jan 2017 15:12:46 CET using RSA key ID EB0FC2C8
gpg: Good signature from "Nio Sudden Wiklund (sudodus) <address@mailserver.com>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 0303 EA77 E34C 52F2 2958  47C6 BD43 C742 EB0F C2C8
tester@xenial32 ~ $ 
</pre>
Then there is reason to trust that nobody else has written the checksums. The date of the signature will change at updates, and the text might be translated to your local language, but it should be clear that it is a 'Good signature from "Nio Sudden Wiklund (sudodus)"'. 

If you have '''the tarballs and the md5sum file in the same directory''', you can use the '''md5sum  program''' to check the tarballs like this,

<pre>
tester@xenial32 ~ $ md5sum -c md5sum-dus-tarballs.txt.asc
dus.tar.xz: OK
dus-plus.tar.xz: OK
md5sum: WARNING: 14 lines are improperly formatted
</pre>

The 'improperly formatted lines' are the lines belonging to the gpg signature.

=== Try first to install from the PPAs and from phillw.net ===

The PPAs should work with Debian and Ubuntu and some distros and re-spins based on Debian and Ubuntu.

=== Use this tarball if it does not work to install from the PPAs ===

Extract from the downloaded tarball
<pre>
tar -xvf dus.tar.gz
tar -xvf dus.tar.xz
</pre>

and change current directory to the directory created by the extraction
<pre>
cd dus-tmp
</pre>

'''or''' extract from the downloaded tarball
<pre>
tar -xvf dus-plus.tar.gz
tar -xvf dus-plus.tar.xz
</pre>

and change current directory to the directory created by the extraction
<pre>
cd dus-tplus
</pre>

==== dus-installer ====

Run the '''dus-installer''' script to '''install''' dus
<pre>
$ sudo ./dus-installer i
</pre>
or
<pre>
</pre>

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <#CCFF99> If the installer wants you to install some other programs, please do so. Otherwise there might be problems to run dus.
|}

or to '''remove''' dus
<pre>
$ sudo ./dus-installer r
</pre>

or
<pre>
</pre>

== Usage text ==

<pre>
$ ./dus-installer 
Run with superuser privileges, as root or with sudo

$ sudo ./dus-installer i  # install with sudo

$ sudo ./dus-installer r  # remove with sudo
</pre>

== Quick start manual ==

'''guidus''' is a GUI front-end to '''dus'''. It provides a desktop file, that is available via the menu system in many linux flavours or dash in Unity. The graphical mode will be selected automatically for most users (running graphical desktop environments)
