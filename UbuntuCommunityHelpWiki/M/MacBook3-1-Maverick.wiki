=== MacBook (3,1) on Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) ===
<nowiki>[[File:MacBooksmall.png]]</nowiki><<BR>><<BR>>

This page aims to help users with '''3rd Generation Mac``Book''' (release date: late 2007) wanting to use '''Ubuntu 10.10, Maverick Meerkat'''.<<BR>>

<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/terminal.png]]</nowiki> You can find out, what model you have by typing at the terminal:<<BR>>
<pre>
sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name
</pre>
<<BR>>
If you have a Mac``Book, but a different hardware revision, please go to the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook|MacBook start page]]</nowiki>. If you have a different Intel CPU-based Macintosh Product, go to the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages|Mactel Community Help Pages]]</nowiki>, to find the right wiki.

=== Overview ===

Using Maverick Meerkat, most features appear to work without special customization. Hence the following page remains relatively compact. For deeper technical issues, more information can be found at <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=328|Ubuntu Apple Users forum]]</nowiki>. 

=== Basic Installation Instructions ===

Common things about installing and maintaining Ubuntu on Intel-based Macs:
<nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation|Intel CPU-based Macintosh Generic Installation Instructions]]</nowiki>

N.B.: Intel Mac users will need to download the customized AMD64+Mac .iso disk image due to changes in the EFI boot configuration in Maverick.

<nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/maverick/release/]]</nowiki>

With OSX Snow Leopard, after installing the latest rEFIt from Sourceforge, the Lucid installer was able to correctly partition and install without particularities into empty space as created by deleting a Boot Camp created partition. [Dual Boot with MACOSX].

Without OSX, Maverick installed normally. [Single Boot Linux].

=== Wireless (AirPort) ===
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/restricted.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>

In Ubuntu 10.10, support for the Air``Port (a Broadcom BCM4328 chip) is  provided seamlessly via Jockey. Just go to '''System -> Hardware Drivers''' and activate "Broadcom STA wireless driver". If your network manager frontend doesn't immediately show the new network interface, you might need to '''reboot''' your Mac``Book. Afterwards you should be good to go!

=== iSight ===
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/webcam.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>

Install the isight-firmware-tools package and direct it to your iSight firmware file AppleUSBVideoSupport, the tool will confirm correct extraction and installation, you may then need to reboot your machine. (The default file location in isight-firmware-tools shows the path to the correct file where /MACOSX is your mac partition. This works with OSX Leopard AppleUSBVideoSupport file, though not the Snow Leopard version.<<BR>>

Kopete video functions (for example) should now operate as expected.

<<BR>><nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/info.png]]</nowiki> If you experience other problems, please look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleiSight

=== Touchpad (appletouch) ===

Touchpad appears to fuction as expected: two finger scroll and right-click. A touchpad control panel has been implemented since Lucid which allows customization: multi-touch tapping and scrolling options are available.

=== Keyboard ===

The keyboard behaves almost identically to OSX, by default fn keys are not function keys (see below to reverse this). Making the command key function as expected for a Mac is as simple as enabling the correct keyboard layout (Macbook/Macbook Pro) in the Input Devices > Keyboard control panel. Various XKB tweaks can be found under the 'Advanced' tab in the same control panel, allowing users to switch all sorts of keyboard functions.

==== Accessing media keys with the fn-key ====

Simply add the line 'echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode' before the line  'exit 0' in /etc/rc.local before restarting.
