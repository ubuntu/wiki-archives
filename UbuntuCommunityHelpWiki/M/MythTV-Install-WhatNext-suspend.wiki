==== ACPI Shutdown & Wakeup ====
If your motherboard is capable, it is possible for MythTV to shut itself down when it is idle and wake itself up if there is a recording scheduled.  One method is by using the built-in ACPI Shutdown/Wakeup via RTC alarm function of many motherboards.  To see if this might be possible with your system and a guide on how you might get this working for you, visit: <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV/Install/WhatNext/ACPIWake|ACPI Shutdown Wakeup]]</nowiki>
