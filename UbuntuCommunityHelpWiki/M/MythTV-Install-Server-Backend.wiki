=== Install MythTV Backend ===
The majority of the rest of the work should be handled by Ubuntu packaging.

The backend will need to have '''mysql-server''' installed as well as '''mythtv-backend'''.  Mythtv-backend doesn't depend on mysql-server since the mysql server can be located elsewhere on your network.  Also, if this is a secondary backend, don't install mythtv-database or mysql-server.  Just configure this backend to connect to the master backend instead.

1. Install mysql and backend software
<pre>
sudo apt-get install mysql-server mythtv-backend mythtv-database
</pre>

2. Behind the scenes, a mythtv user will be created in PAM as well as mysql.  The database will be installed into mysql and the initial configuration performed.  A mythtv group will also be created.  Any user that will be configuring mythtv or running mythtv needs to be placed in this group.

** You will be asked for the password to the root account of mysql.  By default, there is no password.
