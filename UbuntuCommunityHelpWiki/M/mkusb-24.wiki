== mkusb version 12 ---> 22 ... 24 ==

Version 12 of the mkusb tool was only bash scripts and version 24 is still a set of bash scripts.

The menus and dialogue windows are graphical using '''zenity'''. <nowiki>[[File:../artwork/mkusb24.png]]</nowiki> or text based using '''dialog''' or even very basic text, if neither zenity nor dialog is available.

== dus started as mkusb version 12 ==

'''dus''' is a new interface and structure replacing mkusb and mkusb-nox; dus should be easier to use and to maintain. There is a graphical user interface with a desktop file, '''guidus'''.

=== Should work with minimal instructions ===

'''guidus''' is a GUI front-end to '''dus'''. It provides a desktop file, that is available via the menu system in many linux flavours or dash in Unity. The graphical mode will be selected automatically for most users (running graphical desktop environments)

'''Quick start manual version 22- alias dus''', <nowiki>[[https://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/mkusb/mkUSB-quick-start-manual-22.pdf]]</nowiki>

=== Live-only by cloning ===

* '''mkusb-dus can make live-only drives from all hybrid iso files, and most modern linux distros provide hybrid iso files.'''
* Hybrid iso files
** All current Ubuntu iso files
** 12.04 iso files except early mini.iso files
* Possible to make into hybrid iso files
** Ubuntu 10.10 and newer desktop iso files
** Examples:
*** isohybrid ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso
*** isohybrid ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso
* Impossible to make into hybrid iso files
** Ubuntu 10.04, 10.04.x and older iso files
** But mkusb-dus can make a persistent live drive of Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS

=== Persistent live ===

* Linux distributions, 'distros'
** '''mkusb-dus can only make persistent live drives running in and creating from 'desktop' or 'live' iso files of the following distros''' (but not from Ubuntu Server iso files)
** '''Ubuntu''', Ubuntu community flavours and some respins based on Ubuntu
** '''Debian''' and some respins based on Debian 8 'Jessie' and newer versions
* Versions
** Current versions
** '''mkusb-dus can make persistent live drives in and from current versions of Ubuntu''' (not versions that have passed end of life)
** Running mkusb-dus in Ubuntu (the current releases including the developing version).
** Running mkusb-dus in Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS and newer versions

== New features ==

The intention is to continue to maintain the tools belonging to mkusb and to report the progress here for

* '''mkusb-dus''':  dus: dus-live, dus-persistent, dus-iso2usb, dus-restore, dus-wipe ...
* '''mkusb-plug'''
* '''mkusb-nox'''
