'''If your system is crashing or is reporting memory issues or errors in the logs, you should perform a memory test before filing any public bug reports or support requests.'''

This page explains how to perform a memory test on an Ubuntu Live CD and on installed Ubuntu systems.

# Turn On or Restart the system from a clean power on cycle,. 
# Hold down the `Shift` to halt the default GRUB timeout and bring up the GRUB menu.
# Use the arrow keys to move to and select the entry labeled `Ubuntu, memtest86+`, if one exists. 
# The test will run automatically, and continue until you end it by pressing the `Escape` key
# Allow the test to run for at least one full pass and view the report results. 

If your Live CD does not include the memtest86+ entry in the GRUB menu, you can install the package on your running or installed Ubuntu system by using `sudo apt install -y memtest86+`, and it should add an entry for you in the GRUB menu. From there, you can reboot and follow the steps above.
