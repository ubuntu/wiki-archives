=== Install MythTV ===
A backend will need to have mysql-server installed as well as mythtv-backend.  Mythtv-backend doesn't depend on mysql-server since the mysql server can be located elsewhere on your network.  Also, if this is a secondary backend, don't install mythtv-database or mysql-server.  Just configure this backend to connect to the master backend instead.

1. Install the mythtv software.
<pre>
sudo apt-get install mythtv-frontend gdm ubuntu-artwork xterm openbox gnome-screensaver xserver-xorg gsfonts-x11 xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi msttcorefonts xfonts-base mysql-server mythtv-backend mythtv-database usplash-theme-ubuntu
</pre>
** Behind the scenes, a mythtv user will be created in PAM as well as mysql.  The database will be installed into mysql and the initial configuration performed.

** You may be asked to configure postfix.  Choose the "no configuration" option to skip this, as you won't need postfix for this machine.

** You will be asked for the password to the root account of mysql.  By default, there is no password.

  a. If you have a proprietary graphics card driver that you installed earlier, you will need to complete the installation for it right now.
** '''Nvidia:''' sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
** '''ATI:'''    sudo aticonfig --initial

2. Now, we will create a session for the automatic mythtv login.  Create the file <code>/usr/share/xsessions/mythtv.desktop</code>.  Place these contents into that file:

<pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=MythTV
Comment=Use this session to run MythTV
Exec=/usr/local/bin/mythtv.sh
Icon=
Type=Application
</pre>

3. Create a script, /usr/local/bin/mythtv.sh that will be spawned when you login to your MythTV session.  Place these contents into that file:

<pre>
gnome-screensaver
mythfrontend&
exec openbox
</pre>

** If you are running lirc and using irexec for any of your key detection, you probably also want to add this section.  It will be sure that if X is ever restarted, irexec doesn't spawn multiple instances

<pre>
killall irexec
irexec -d
</pre>

** If you are running an nvidia graphics card, you should add:

<pre>
nvidia-settings -l
</pre>

** If you are planning on running the myth transcoding daemon for ripping dvds, you will want to add:

<pre>
mtd -d
</pre>

** If you come up with anything else for your custom startup script, <code>/usr/local/bin/mythtv.sh</code> will be the place to add it.

3. Be sure to set <code>/usr/local/bin/mythtv.sh</code> to be executable.
<pre>
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mythtv.sh
</pre>

4. Start gdm.
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
</pre>

6. Run gdmsetup.
<pre>
sudo gdmsetup
</pre>
{| class="wikitable"

| <|1> Gdmsetup is used to configure an automatic login for your main user name (in this case <code>superm1</code>) as well as a time delayed login if you logout.  This will make the bootup a lot more streamlined (especially for HTPC use)

13. Set the newly created MythTV session to be the default.  This will make sure that on the next reboot, MythTV comes up by default.

** Note: at least one user had difficulties logging out of the openbox session to return to the login screen.  If you encounter similar issues, you should try to first restart GDM.
** Switch to virtual terminal 1 (CTRL-ALT-F1)
** Login
** Restart GDM
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
</pre>
** If restarting GDM didn't work, reboot your machine to see if GDM comes up after the fresh boot.
