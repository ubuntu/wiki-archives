==== Plugins ====
For a non-backend machine, the only un-applicable plugin is mythweb.  '''Don't''' install the mythplugins metapackage.  This will cause all the plugins ''including'' mythweb to be installed.

See <nowiki>[[MythTV_Edgy_Plugins]]</nowiki> for more information about what plugins are available and how to install them.
