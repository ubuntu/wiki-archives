== Clonezilla live 2.5.0-25 (64-bit) with mkusb version 12.1.8+ ==

This might be a useful tool for new computers, because it is

* modern, uses Debian's 64-bit linux kernel 4.9.6-3 (2017-01-28) 
** works in UEFI mode and BIOS mode (but not with secure boot)
* small, compressed image sizes 246 MiB and 260 MiB; expand to 4 GB, so they fit in a 4GB USB pendrive or memory card)
* simple, uses text mode, so less problems with drivers for graphics chips/cards
* low resource, uses very little RAM
* combination tool, you get both Clonezilla and mkusb
* it remembers what you did last time in the bash shell, with Clonezilla, and you can save files on the drive because it is persistent live.
* If the drive is bigger than 4  GB, you can edit the partitions in order to use the whole drive, <nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios/GrowIt.pdf|GrowIt.pdf]]</nowiki>

"'''mkusb 12.1.8+''' because '''mkusb 12.1.9''' was in the pipeline" when this compressed image file was created. There were fixes in order to make mkusb-dus work in Clonezilla (and still, you must tweak it manually in order to create a persistent live drive based on Clonezilla).

These systems come in small files compared to the other persistent live systems with mkusb (246 MiB and 260 MiB) and need not much hardware in order to run. They work in 64-bit computers in BIOS & UEFI mode ('''not''' in secure boot). There is an msdos partition table, suitable when not installing with mkusb, for example in Windows.

* It is easy to connect remotely via ssh to the version '...ssh-with-password.img.xz'.
** '''user: user'''
** '''password: live'''
** Please be aware of the risk, when using remote login with a password. So even if you change the password, you should only use that system behind a router with a firewall. 

* '''Advantages:''' modern, should boot in new computers, small, low resource, drivers for advanced graphics chips not necessary (because of text mode).
* '''Disadvantages:''' 'only' text mode, limited support for network hardware compared to the Ubuntu based systems (good for wired network, maybe not so good for wifi), does not work in 32-bit computers.

=== How it was made ===

* A computer was booted persistent live from the USB pendrive that was created. The system was tweaked to work correctly as a persistent live drive
* '''mkusb''' was installed via a '''tarball''' and tweaked
* the shellscript file '''text-mode-menu''' was 'borrowed' from the text-mode UEFI-n-BIOS installed systems and modified to manage Clonezilla and mkusb. A new file, '''text-mode-list-files''' was created for mkusb.
* '''clean-myself.bash''' and '''truncate-log''' were copied to the home directory and used to make the system as clean as possible to reduce the size of the compressed image file
* '''grub.cfg''' in the usbboot partition was tweaked for this particular system

=== Size ===

* The compressed image files are rather small, 246 MiB and 260 MiB, while the corresponding Lubuntu image file is ~ 900 MB. 
* The system '''expands to 4 GB on the pendrive''', so the size of the USB pendrive or memory card or SSD drive must be at least 4 GB.
* It is an advantage to use a '''fast''' USB 3 pendrive, and the sizes of such drives are almost always 16 GB or more. See this link and links from it, <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#Notes_about_speed]]</nowiki>.

* You can '''grow''' the system (change the size and move the partitions '''casper-rw''' and '''usbdata''') according to this link, '''<nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios/GrowIt.pdf|GrowIt.pdf]]</nowiki>''', so that you use the whole pendrive. After changing the size of '''usbdata''', Windows may complain, but you can repair it with the repair tool in Windows.

== Tested in the following computers ==

=== Newest computer tested - Intel NUC6i3SYH-2016 (2016) ===

=== Oldest computer tested - GGS data with ASUS M2N-VM-DVI mobo (2008) ===

* Processor: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4400+
