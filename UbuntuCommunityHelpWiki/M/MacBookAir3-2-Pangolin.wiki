__TOC__

You can boot straight EFI by holding down the option key while booting the CDROM and choose efi boot. If you create a GPT table (no hybrid) and use 64bit-grub (Pangolin does by default) you will have some video distortion that can be fixed after install. Connect an external monitor as the glitch doesn't appear to affect external screens.

To fix the video distortion you will need to upgrade your kernel to 3.2.0-27 or higher.

apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade # seems to do the trick for me

The fan seemed to peg so I installed macfanctl

```
sudo apt-get install lm-sensors
echo coretemp >> /etc/modules
```
```
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:mactel-support/ppa ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install macfanctld
```

I had to add 'exclude: 8 14 17 18' to /etc/macfanctl.conf as those four sensors were pegged round 255* or switching between 0 and 255* causing the fan to not work as expected.

Pure EFI! with backlight, sleep, suspend, wireless out of the box (all opensource, no binary drivers).
