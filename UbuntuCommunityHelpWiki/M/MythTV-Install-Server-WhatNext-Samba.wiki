==== Samba File Sharing ====
A very useful thing for a mixed windows/linux/mac network is setting up Samba on your MythTV machine.  
A couply of ideas you can use samba for:
* Sharing your recordings via a centralized network share that is accessed through links for mythweb.  
* Copying pictures/dvds/videos back and forth among the machines from on the windows/mac machines
* Mounting a windows/mac network share on your backend to access content stored on the windows or mac

See the Ubuntu guide for more information about setting up samba: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Samba_Server
