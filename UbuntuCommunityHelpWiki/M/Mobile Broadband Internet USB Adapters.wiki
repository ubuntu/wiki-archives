== Sprint Novatel Wireless Ovation U727 CDMA ==

The trick to using the Sprint USB CDMA stick is to plug it in and reboot.
It is initially seen as a USB memory stick by 9.10. Eject the disk icon that
appears on your desktop by right clicking and ejecting (unmount does not work). The wireless is then recognized and can be set-up using System: Preferences: Network Connections: Mobile Broadband Add connection. If you don't eject the USB memory
that co-resides on the stick, the wireless is never recognized. Also, you have
to have the stick plugged in when you boot. Works on Acer Aspire One 9"
portable with standard distribution of 9.10.

== 3G Option 225 "Web and Walk" T-Mobile Mobile Broadband Adapter ==

The T-Mobile adapter comes with Linux drivers on the T-Mobile CD but these are only meant for the default Xandros install on Asus Eee PC and install will fail on Ubuntu.

Ubuntu 8.04 can be set up to use the current Option USB adapter, but it is not a plug in and go solution. The process involves compiling and installing some packages. See <nowiki>[[http://www.blogeee.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=8624&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a|this forum thread]]</nowiki>. This solution will work <nowiki>[[http://peck.org.uk/hso.html|for these USB adapters]]</nowiki>. Use "lsusb" to check the ID of your adapter. The instructions are duplicated here.

Hi,

just to let you know that finally i managed to get the
Option icon 225 3G USB stick (t-mobile Germany web'n'walk)
to work on my
Asus Eee PC 901 running Ubuntu-eee 8.04.1.

Files needed:

'''hso-1.6.tar.gz

udev.tar.gz

hsoconnect-py2.5_1.1.83_all.deb

hsolink_1.0.46-1_i386.deb'''

for your convenience provided bundled here:
<nowiki>[[http://data.mybestprojects.com/4-files_for_HSO.tar.gz|http://data.mybestprojects.com/4-files_for_HSO.tar.gz]]</nowiki>

If you read this after November 2008 check for newer versions first!

Preparations:

On a newly installed Ubuntu 8.04(.1) or Ubuntu-eee 8.04.1:

'''sudo apt-get install libusb-dev

sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)'''

In System -> Administration -> Users and Groups create a new group named dialout.
Make sure root and your user name are in the dialout group.

Installation:

Extract

'''hso-1.6.tar.gz

udev.tar.gz'''

Recompile both:

'''sudo make

sudo make install'''

Install by double clicking:

'''hsoconnect-py2.5_1.1.83_all.deb

hsolink_1.0.46-1_i386.deb'''

| Watch the compile messages carefully. You may need to compile the packages in the correct order, or use "make clean" as one of the packages comes with precompiled libraries and they should be built natively.
|}

Reboot.

Connect

Applications -> Internet -> HSOconnect

Enter your Settings.
List of settings for German 3G providers:
http://www.teltarif.de/i/gprs-config.html

Settings for mine (t-mobile Germany):

In Preferences enter

APN =internet.t-mobile

Username = anything

Password = anything

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| These are the current profile settings for T-Mobile. APN=general.t-mobile.uk, USER=t-mobile, PASS=, PIN=
|}

Save

Click "Connect".

And it works!

==== Troubleshooting ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| In my tests HSO connect conflicts with my installation of WiCD (Wireless connections manager), so make sure you quit before connecting over Mobile Broadband. I also turned off wireless on my EeePC which seemed to help
|}

Check if HSOlinkcontrol is there:

ls -al `which hsolinkcontrol`

should have this result:

-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 5048 2008-05-04 01:07 /usr/bin/hsolinkcontrol

What a successful connection looks like in HSOconnect debug window:

http://data.mybestprojects.com/Debug_Window.txt

Option icon 225 in 3G mode?

Reboot, then wait 30 seconds.

dmesg

now should display something like this:

<pre>

Start HSOconnect manually in Terminal for extra output in Terminal window:

sudo python -m hsoc

Your linux kernel:

uname -a

== How to enable ZTE MF626 USB Broadband Modem (Telstra) for Amaysim ==
<pre>
    Unlock the device
        Use DC-Unlocker. It only costs 7 EUR.
        You might have to do it twice, it doesn't use extra credits.
        I rebooted in-between to be sure.
    Add New Connection (with new SIM in the device)
        Windows
            Use the Telstra Connection Manager Utility
                Config Filename:                            Amaysim
                Dial Number:                                *99#
                User Name:                                  <blank>
                Password:                                   <blank>
                Use the following APN:                      internet
                Obtain DNS server address automatically:    YES
                PDP Type:                                   IP
                Authentication Mode:                        CHAP
                Obtain PDP address automatically:           YES
        Linux (Ubuntu)
            Via GUI
                Right-click the network icon and "Edit Connections"
                    "Add"
                        IPv4 Settings
                            Automatic (PPP)

                            Network ID:     <blank>
                            Allow Roaming:  YES
                            PIN:            <blank>

                            Compression
                                Use point-to-point encryption (MPPE): NO
