* This persistent Bodhi linux system contains '''bodhi-4.1.0-32.iso''' and mkusb version 12.1.5.

* The system is very flexible. It works in 32 & 64 bit computers in BIOS & UEFI mode, also in secure boot. There is an msdos partition table, suitable when not installing with mkusb, for example in Windows.

* There is a backup file of the original system. The system as stored in the '''casper-rw''' partition can be restored to the original state from the tarball '''1-casper-rw.tar.gz''', but the content of the '''usb-data''' partition is still there, and other (more current states can be backed up and restored from other tarballs. It is a good idea to store copies of the backup files (tarballs) in a separate drive.
* Advantages: very flexible, modern and rather small system (~800 MB, smaller than the corresponding Lubuntu and LXLE images), one image works for 'almost all' PC computers.
* Disadvantage: The system is not as stable as Lubuntu and LXLE.

=== How it was made ===

* '''mkusb''' was installed into '''Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS''' and used to create a persistent live drive from the iso file '''bodhi-4.1.0-32.iso'''. The reason for this old version of Ubuntu is that its version of grub can be booted by some old computers, for example Dell Dimension 4600 from 2004. And it can be booted by new computers too, for example Intel NUC6i3SYH from 2016.

* A computer was booted persistent live from the USB pendrive that was created
* mkusb was installed and a link to its desktop file was created
* clean-myself.bash and truncate-log were copied to the home directory and used to make the system as clean as possible to reduce the size of the compressed image file
* grub.cfg in the usbboot partition was tweaked for this particular system
* The computer was booted live-only and the backup file '''1-casper-rw.tar.gz''' was created in the '''usbdata''' partition.

=== Size ===

* The compressed image file is rather small, ~ 800 MB (while the corresponding Lubuntu image file is ~ 900 MB). 
* the system '''expands to 7.8 GB on the pendrive''', so the size of the USB pendrive or memory card or SSD drive must be at least 8 GB.
* It is an advantage to use a '''fast''' USB 3 pendrive, and the sizes of such drives are almost always 16 GB or more. See this link and links from it, <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#Notes_about_speed]]</nowiki>.

* You can '''grow''' the system (change the size and move the partitions '''casper-rw''' and '''usbdata''') according to this link, '''<nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios/GrowIt.pdf|GrowIt.pdf]]</nowiki>''', so that you use the whole pendrive. After changing the size of '''usbdata''', Windows may complain, but you can repair it with the repair tool in Windows.

== Backup and Restore ==

There is a backup file of the original system. The system as stored in the '''casper-rw''' partition can be restored to the original state from the tarball '''1-casper-rw.tar.gz''', but the content of the '''usb-data''' partition is still there, and other (more current states can be backed up and restored from other tarballs. It is a good idea to store copies of the backup files (tarballs) in a separate drive.
