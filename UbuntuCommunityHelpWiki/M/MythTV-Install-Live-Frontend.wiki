=== Install MythTV Frontend ===
The majority of the rest of the work should be handled by Ubuntu packaging.

1. Install the mythtv software.

** From Synaptic Package Manager, Search for mythtv.  Choose '''mythtv-frontend'''.  Press the apply button and mythtv will be installed.

2. Copy <code>/etc/mythtv/mysql.txt</code> from your backend machine to /etc/mythtv.

3.  
4. Test the Frontend.  Launch the frontend from a terminal window.

<pre>
mythfrontend
</pre>

** Watch for any error messages in the terminal.  As long as this is free from errors, you can launch from the icon in the Sound & Video group from now on.
