=== Installation and Setup ===

* Install MythGallery with synaptic, adept, or by issuing this command in the console:
   <pre>
$ sudo apt-get install mythgallery
   </pre>

* Open MythFrontend and navigate to Utilities/Setup --> Setup --> Media Settings --> Image Settings
* Input the path where you store your photos in the box labeled: "Directory that holds images:" (eg:)
   <pre>
/home/user/MyPhotos
   </pre>

=== Usage ===

* To use MythGallery go to Media Library --> Image Gallery and browse your photo collection

=== A Note about LIRC ===

* If you use a remote control with MythTV (through LIRC) you will need to make sure you have commands to control mplayer set up in your /home/user/.mythtv/lircrc file.  When you select a photo mplayer is used to display that photo and once opened, your remote control will not function unless mplayer controls are defined.
