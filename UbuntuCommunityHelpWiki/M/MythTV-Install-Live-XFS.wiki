=== Install XFS Utilities ===
Since you chose XFS for your partition type during the installation process, you will probably want to install the appropriate utilities to maintain your XFS partition.  During the boot process, the drive will be checked for errors and these errors fixed with the XFS utilities.

Open up Synaptic Package Manager.  Search for '''xfsprogs'''.  Click on xfsprogs to mark it.  Press the apply button, and it will be installed.
