=== Backups ===
A normal part of mythtv maintenance is damage recovery.  If god forbid your box is to go down, its best to be ready to recover quickly.
This can range from having to do regular backups of the operating system, to instead regularly backing up the mysql database.
Since you set up the machine with a seperate partition for recordings, an operating system backup should be fairly small and manageable.  I'd recommend you investigate <code> sbackup </code> for this purpose.
