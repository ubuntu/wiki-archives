=== About ===

This page helps you to find the right documentation, when you want to install  '''Ubuntu''' on a '''Mac mini'''.

=== Determine your hardware revision ===

To determine which version / generation of Mac``mini you have, you can ...

<nowiki>[[File:OSX.png]]</nowiki> either click in OS X on the Apple on the top left, then "About this Mac" -- "More Info...", see the generation in the "Model Identifier" row; or ... 

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/ubuntu.png]]</nowiki> ... under Ubuntu, you can find out what model you have, by typing at the terminal:
<pre>
sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name
</pre>
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/terminal.png]]</nowiki> A terminal is opened by going to Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal. 

It will tell you something like ''Mac``mini``2,1'' for example. 

=== MacBook Hardware Revisions and Ubuntu version-specific wikis ===

Now choose the link to the wiki of your hardware revision and the Ubuntu version you are looking for. If you haven't decided yet, what version you like to install: We recommend to '''install the latest official Ubuntu version'''. If there is no such a wiki available, ask for help in the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=328|support forum]]</nowiki>!
