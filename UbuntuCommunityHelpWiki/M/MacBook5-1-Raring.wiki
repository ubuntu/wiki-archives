=== MacBook 5,1 and Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring) ===

This page aims to describe the steps needed, to fully enable all features of the '''1st Generation MacBook Unibody''' (release date: late 2008) when using '''Ubuntu 13.04, Raring'''.<<BR>>

You can find the Ubuntu 13.04 Mac desktop image here: <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/|Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) Daily Build]]</nowiki>. When doing a full disk installation you can savely pick the regular 64bit build (not the Mac version). The only difference is that EFI is disabled in the Mac version (<nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/mactel-support/+question/162838|Source, answer #2]]</nowiki>).

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/terminal.png]]</nowiki> You can find out, what model you have by typing at the terminal:<<BR>>
<pre>
sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name
</pre>

 If you have a different model, please go <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages|here]]</nowiki> and find the right wiki.

=== Overview ===

Anything not mentioned here probably already works out of the box. If not, please refer to the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=328|Ubuntu Apple Users forum]]</nowiki>.

=== Basic Installation Instructions ===
Common things about installing and maintaining Ubuntu on Intel-based Macs:
<nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation|Intel CPU-based Macintosh Generic Installation Instructions]]</nowiki>.

You can also install Ubuntu by replacing MacOS as the installer offers you. This makes full disk encryption easy since you can use the corresponding full-disk-install option.

When doing a MacOS replacement install: To decrease booting time do the following after you have installed Ubuntu: restart and hold the alt/option-key. Press enter while holding the control-button. This will decrease the time for the initial "lit-screen" from about 45 to 12 second.

=== Wireless (AirPort) ===
You need to check "Third-Party"-Software while installing or do the following afterwards: Open and choose Broadcom STA in:

* '''System''' -> '''Administration''' -> '''Additional Drivers'''

At least with 12.10 it seemed to be important to have a internet connection while installing otherwise event the above way wont get network-manager to work with the wireless card.

=== Desktop Effects (Unity) & Keyboard functions (Brightness) ===
If you want to enable proprietary graphic drivers you can do that here. I strongly recommend that you install the following before activating Nvidia drivers:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
</pre>

Otherwise you probably will encounter a black screen or a login promt instead of lightdm after your netxt reboot.

* '''System Settings''' -> '''Software & Updates''' -> '''Additional Drivers'''

Tested: "Experimental NVIDIA ... from nvidia-experimental-310 (proprietary)"<<BR>>
After installing 310 you have to follow these steps to get you brightness-control-keys to work again: <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/a/254548|Brightness control not working- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - Macbook pro 5,5]]</nowiki>.

Note: You should be able to disable the Nvidia branding this way: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=918705&p=7497223#post7497223|disable nvidia splash screen]]</nowiki>. 

=== Fans ===
If you get the impression that you Mac runs hotter than usual (as I did), then add the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/PPA#Installation|Mactel PPA repository]]</nowiki> and install the following package. It will start your fan sooner. You can uninstall/reinstall it anytime and should hear the effect immediately.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install macfanctld 
</pre>

If you get an error while running update it means you have to edit the contents of the following file and exchange "raring" with "quantal":
<pre>
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mactel-support-ppa-raring.list
</pre>

Note: You can observe CPU temperature with this tool: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~alexmurray/+archive/indicator-sensors]]</nowiki>.

=== Trackpad ===
Left-click, right-click (two finger-)use and basic trackpad work out of the box.

You can switch to two-finger-scrolling here:

* '''System Settings''' -> '''Mouse & Touchpad'''
 
=== Suspend ===
I had to install the Nvidia drivers as shown <nowiki>[[#Desktop_Effects_.28Unity.29_.26_Keyboard_functions_.28Brightness.29|above]]</nowiki> to get it to work. It then worked with and without full-disk encryption.

=== Booting a LiveCD & reinstalling ===
If you have installed Ubuntu as a Mac replacement you get the problem that booting from the Ubuntu live cd just gives you a grub rescue shell. The long way to solve this would be to use the MacOS cd to format the harddrive. The short to do the following (as adapted from <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1599293|here]]</nowiki>):

- With Efi enabled. The best solution (its ought to decrease temperature and increase battery life), but only tested with a full disk install:
<pre>
set root=(cd0)
linuxefi /casper/vmlinuz.efi boot=casper
initrdefi /casper/initrd.lz
boot
</pre>
In case of Ubuntu 12.10 it would be "/casper/vmlinuz.efi.signed".
If the booting process comes to a halt and wont continue, restart and swap "set root=(cd0)" for:
<pre>
set root=(hd2)
</pre>
If it comes to an halt while displaying something with "magic numer", sometimes you get it to work by restarting and using 
<pre>
linuxefi /casper/vmlinuz.efi boot=casper nopromt noeject
</pre>

- Efi disabled:
<pre>
set root=(cd0)
linux /casper/vmlinuz.efi boot=casper
initrd /casper/initrd.lz
boot
</pre>

=== Sidenodes & Errorcodes ===

==== Nvidia driver blackscreen / login promt after reboot (with or without EFI enabled) ====
If you encounter
<pre>
Module build for the currently running kernel was skipped since the
kernel source for this kernel does not seem to be installed.
</pre>
after trying to install the Nvidia drivers (on your Mac 5.1 with or without EFI enabled) do the following (as recommended above):
<pre>
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
</pre>
then reinstall your Nvidia driver, e.g.
<pre>
sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current
sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
</pre>

==== Small solution & dash missing after nvidia driver install ====
Same solution as above: <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook5-1/Raring#Nvidia_driver_blackscreen_.2BAC8_login_promt_after_reboot_.28with_or_without_EFI_enabled.29|Nvidia driver blackscreen / login promt after reboot (with or without EFI enabled)]]</nowiki>

==== Switching back to the standard driver Nouveau via terminal ====
If you ever want to do that via the terminal do the following:
<pre>
sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
sudo apt-get purge xserver-xorg-video-nouveau
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau
</pre>
