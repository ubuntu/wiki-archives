==== XvMC Video Output ====
If you have either an intel integrated graphics card or a NVidia 4, 5, 6, or 7 series card, you can enable XvMC video output.  This takes a good portion of the load off of the CPU, and instead puts it on the graphics card.  This can be a life saver for some users wanting to do HD playback with a lower end box, or even SD playback on a much lower end box.

* For Nvidia, you will have to modify <code>/etc/X11/XvMCConfig</code> to include this instead of its current contents
<pre>
libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so.1
</pre>

* For all cards, go to Utilities/Setup in the frontend.  Choose Setup and then TV Settings and then Playback.  Change the Preferred MPEG2 Decoder to be Standard XvMC. Restart your frontend app to ensure that /etc/X11/XvMCConfig is sourced and attempt to play back a file.  You will notice the grey OSD rather then the normal color OSD.
