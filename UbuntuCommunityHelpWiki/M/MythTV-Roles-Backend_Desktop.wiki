== Backend & Regular Desktop ==
A likely candidate for a backend and desktop machine is one that will not be ''overworked'' by other tasks and won't necessarily be used for frontend playback.  The machine can perform backend-related tasks in the background while the computer is being used for other things such as word processing, surfing the internet, etc.  Another application for this type of installation is as a slave backend for background use by MythTV as a recorder, or strictly for performing jobs such as transcoding or commercial flagging.
