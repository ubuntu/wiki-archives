This is only if you do not have an internet connection to upgrade with.

1) Insert the alternate CD, open it in a new window, open the '''Run Command''' dialog by pressing '''Alt+F2''' or if this is not working right click on the desktop or as a last resort, run a terminal window.

==== Troubleshooting ====

If you get an error stating one of these possibilities:<<BR>>
* Upgrading to a pre-release version of Ubuntu<<BR>>
* Running the current pre-release version of Ubuntu<<BR>>
* Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu<<BR>>

try executing the following:<<BR>>
<<BR>>
'sudo dpkg --configure -a' in a terminal.<<BR>>
<<BR>>
Afterwards, reboot, and try the upgrade again. This should help to fix any broken packages
that are missing due to upgrade problems.
