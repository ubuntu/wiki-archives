=== Install OpenSSH Server ===
From this point forward, I'd recommend you have a ssh server running.  It may make it easier to work and debug problems, especially when working with remote machines as necessary.

For a Live CD based installation your will have a graphical interface available to you to enable all of the extra Ubuntu repositories.

Click on System.  Choose Administration.  Choose Synaptic Package Manager.  Search for '''openssh'''.  Click on openssh-server to mark it.  Press the apply button, and it will be installed.
