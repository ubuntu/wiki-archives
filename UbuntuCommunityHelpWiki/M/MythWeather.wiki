The current MythWeather in Fiesty no longer works as MSNBC has changed their data format.  In order to get a working version of MythWeather you must build from the new mythweather-revamp source, which I must stress is beta code.

=== Get All Requirements ===
Get everything that may be required to build MythWeather
<pre>
sudo apt-get install build-essential 
sudo apt-get build-dep mythtv mythweather
</pre>

Get the perl modules that are missing
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libxml-simple-perl libsoap-lite-perl libdate-manip-perl libimage-size-perl libgraphics-magick-perl 
</pre>

=== Get the Source ===
If you don't have subversion installed
<pre>
sudo apt-get install subversion 
</pre>

You need to check out the MythPlugin source from here
<pre>
sudo svn co http://svn.mythtv.org/svn/branches/release-0-21-fixes/mythplugins
</pre>

=== Compile the Source ===
<pre>
cd mythplugins
sudo ./configure --disable-all --enable-mythweather --prefix=/usr
sudo make
sudo make install
</pre>

=== Fix Script Permissions ===
Sometimes the Perl scripts do not get execute permissions, we need to fix this
<pre>
cd /usr/share/mythtv/mythweather/scripts
sudo chmod +x *.pl
</pre>

=== Configure MythWeather ===
MythWeather should now be installed, it is time to enter your MythTv Frontend in order to configure MythWeather.
<pre>
Utilities/Setup -> Setup -> Info Center Settings -> Weather Settings -> Screen Settings
</pre>
Choose the screens you want to show up in MythWeather, after choosing a screen make sure you move down to the Active Screens and choose a location for each one.  When you are done you need to save your data by hitting your menu button, default is 'M'.
