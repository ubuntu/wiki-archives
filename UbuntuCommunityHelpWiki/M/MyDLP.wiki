=== Introduction ===

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a computer security term referring to systems that identify, monitor, and protect data in use (e.g., endpoint actions), data in motion (e.g., network actions), and data at rest (e.g., data storage) through deep content inspection, contextual security analysis of transaction (attributes of originator, data object, medium, timing, recipient/destination, etc.), and with a centralized management framework. The systems are designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized use and transmission of confidential information. [1]

Almost all indispensable office applications and devices are potential data leakage sources. Organizations struggle to achieve security without hindering performance. On one side restrictive policies on web, e-mail, removable memory devices, smart-phones, printers , laptops removes almost all advantages of today’s unified office environment. On the other side, compliance requirements, unmitigated risks, real-life horror stories occurring everyday pressures IT management.

MyDLP development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
