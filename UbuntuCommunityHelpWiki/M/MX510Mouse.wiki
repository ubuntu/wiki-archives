== Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04: ==
The MX510 should work more or less as you like it with these versions.

If you like to open a terminal with the "Logitech button" just do the following:

<code>nano .xbindkeysrc</code>

And write the following:

<pre>
"/usr/bin/gnome-terminal"
b:10
</pre>

Save, install xbindkeys (
<code>sudo apt-get install xbindkeys</code>
), and set xbindkeys to start by adding it to:
System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications -> Add -> xbindkeys in all fields.

If you use Opera (version 9.64), you might like to have the thumb-buttons to browse back/(fast) forward. This is done the following way (Opera makes a backup on its own):

Tools -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Shortcuts -> Select "Opera Standard" -> Edit -> Applications -> New

Now you write "Button8" on the left field and "Back" on the right. Press New again, add "Button9" on the left and "Forward | Fast Forward" right. Press "OK" on both forms and everything should work.

== Earlier versions: ==
=== 0. Creating backup ===
First of all, run

<code>sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf~backup</code>

If your system hangs, you can run

<code>sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf~backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>

to get x back.

=== 1. Changing xorg.conf ===
<code>cat /proc/bus/input/devices</code>

and find the one with:

<code>N: Name="Logitech USB-PS/2 Optical Mouse"</code>

look at "Handlers", f.ex.

<code>H: Handlers=mouse1 event4</code>

note the number after event, (i.e. event4)

in xorg.conf:

<code>gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>

change
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Configured Mouse"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"CorePointer"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/mice"
	Option		"Protocol"	"ImPS/2"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"	"4 5"
	Option		"Emulate3Buttons"	"true"
EndSection}}}
to
{{{
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Configured Mouse"
	Driver		"evdev"
	Option		"CorePointer"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/event4"
	Option		"Protocol"	"ImPS/2"
	Option		"Buttons"	"10"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"	"4 5"
	Option		"Emulate3Buttons"	"true"
EndSection}}}
(Changed Driver to "evdev", changed "Device" to "/dev/input/[THE EVENT FROM EARLIER]" added Option "Buttons" "10")

Restart x by logging out and back in, or typing <code>sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart</code>, and everything should work. If you can't get back in to gnome, you could revert from backup as stated above and run
<code>sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart</code>
If everything works continue to the next step.

=== 2. Mapping the keys ===
Install xvkbd and xbindkeys
<code>sudo apt-get install xvkbd xbindkeys</code>
and make the ~/.xbindkeysrc file:
<code>gedit ~/.xbindkeysrc</code>
write
{{{
"/usr/X11R6/bin/xvkbd -xsendevent -text "\[Alt_L]\[Left]""
  m:0x0 + b:6
"/usr/X11R6/bin/xvkbd -xsendevent -text "\[Alt_R]\[Right]""
  m:0x0 + b:7
"/usr/bin/gnome-terminal"
  b:8
</pre>
and save. (enables back and forward. the last two lines makes the "logitech button" or whatever start a new terminal)

Then run

<code>xbindkeys</code>

and everything should work.

Then make xbindkeys start automatically:

System -> Preferences -> Sessions -> Add -> xbindkeys

=== (3. Eventual problems) ===
Some users have had problems with wrong mapping of the scroll-buttons.
This can be solved with adding the following line to the "InputDevice" section in xorg.conf:

<code>Option "ButtonMapping" "1 2 3 4 5 9 10 8 6 7"</code>

Ending up with:

<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Configured Mouse"
	Driver		"evdev"
	Option		"CorePointer"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/event4"
	Option		"Protocol"	"ImPS/2"
	Option		"Buttons"	"10"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"	"4 5"
	Option		"Emulate3Buttons"	"true"
	Option "ButtonMapping" "1 2 3 4 5 9 10 8 6 7"
EndSection
</pre>

To test witch buttons are mapped to what you can run the following command in a terminal:

<code>xev | grep button</code>
