Please notice that mkusb-nox was upgraded to version 22.1.0 during 2022. 

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa  # and press Enter
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mkusb-nox

== mkusb-bas ==

There are some commands in mkusb and mkusb-nox, which are not available in old or very small linux distros, for example '''Wary Puppy'''. A simple version based on version 7.4 is made for such cases - '''mkusb-bas'''.

<nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/mkusb/mkUSB-quick-start-manual-bas.pdf|This basic mode quick start manual]]</nowiki> describes the basic version '''mkusb-bas'''.

mkusb-bas can be downloaded from phillw.net
<pre>
wget http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/mkusb/mkusb-bas

== mkusb version 7.5 - mkusb-nox ==

== mkusb-nox version 22.1 ==

There is a major upgrade of 'mkusb-nox' in order to make it useful today (2022, after six years of 'sleep'). It is a useful cloning tool when running in text mode. 'mkusb-nox' and also useful when iso-testing because it identifies the target device almost automatically.

Users without a GUI may prefer 'mkusb-nox'. It can clone an iso file or img file to make a live drive in a safe way. It has the original mkusb user interface to help you identify and select the correct target device. 'mkusb-nox' works with USB and other drives seen as '/dev/sdx' and memory cards seen as '/dev/mmcblkn' where 'x' is a letter and 'n' is a digit.

'mkusb-nox' can still be very efficient for iso-testing (repeated cloning of daily updates of iso files to the same target device even when running in a terminal window of a graphical desktop environment).

<pre>
sudo mkusb-nox file.iso all   # 'all' to show all mass storage devices
</pre>

<nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/mkusb/mkUSB-quick-start-manual-nox.pdf|The text mode quick start manual]]</nowiki> describes the non-menu '''No X'''

=== Separate versions for graphical mode and text mode ===

Starting with version 9 there are separate versions for

* GUI mode: '''mkusb'''
* text mode: '''mkusb-nox'''

This avoids some complicated logic and makes the code smaller. The text version is good for servers and for users who do not want eye-candy. The '''improved recognition of systems and devices''' is back-ported from version 8 and updated to the level of version 9 for '''mkusb-nox'''.

=== Small and flexible ===

'''mkusb-nox''' needs no extra packages (but in some cases can make the user experience nicer, if you let it install pv). It runs in text screens, terminal windows, via ssh and other network connections.

=== Use 'mkusb-dus' or 'mkusb-plug' to make persistent live drives ===

'mk-grub-n-iso-s' was developed into 'dus-persistent' but '''mkusb-nox''' is still only cloning Linux iso files. It cannot make persistent live drives, but you can use 'mkusb-dus' in text mode and 'mkusb-sedd' (also in text mode) without using its GUI 'mkusb-plug'.

=== Installation and downloading ===

The '''mkusb-nox''' package is available alongside the mkusb package from '''ppa:mkusb/ppa'''. and '''ppa:mkusb/unstable'''

It can also be downloaded as a tarball with the single file from <nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/mkusb/]]</nowiki>

Check the tarball with the corresponding md5sum and extract '''mkusb-nox''' with
<pre>
tar -xvf mkusb-nox.tar.xz
</pre>

=== Using mkusb-nox ===

==== Making a live drive with mkusb-nox version 22.1.0 ====

'''mkusb-nox''' makes an empty USB-connected SSD bootable with Lubuntu Kinetic:

'''mkusb-nox''' updates a USB-connected SSD bootable with Lubuntu Kinetic, 'iso-testing':

<nowiki>[[File:mkusb-nox_same-iso_w-lsblk.jpg]]</nowiki>

==== Making a USB drive to install Windows ====

Please notice that the method in mkusb-nox is deprecated for current versions of Windows (10,11) in 2022.

This method can be used in 32-bit systems, where there are problems with other methods. (It was not possible to extract the content from the Windows iso file directly to a USB pendrive. The files were not copied correctly (with any of the standard copying tools: cp, rsync, dd) in Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (the current Ubuntu version, when this feature was added to mkusb-nox). But it works in a reliable way to extract to a tarfile, and then extract from the tarfile to the USB pendrive.)

In 64-bit systems you should use '''mkusb-tow''' via '''mkusb-dus''' or via '''mkusb-plug'''. That method can manage huge Windows iso files with the file '''install.wim''' that expands to more than 4 GiB.

==== Dialogue with comments ====

The following dialogue in a terminal window will '''run mkusb-nox, start by installing pv''' and then install two iso files into a pendrive (one after another, at the end 'ISO-testing' re-cloning with the daily build.

Running in '''Arch linux''' illustrates that mkusb-nox works in many different linux distros. You will find that mkusb-nox can use the pacman installer and suggests to install pv (if it is not installed).

== mkusb version 7.4.x - mkusb-bas ==

There are some commands in mkusb and mkusb-nox, which are not available in old or very small linux distros, for example '''Wary Puppy'''. A simple version based on mkusb 7.4 is made for such cases - '''mkusb-bas'''.

<nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/mkusb/mkUSB-quick-start-manual-bas.pdf|The basic mode quick start manual]]</nowiki> describes the text only and non-menu version '''mkusb-bas'''

It can be downloaded as a single file from <nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/mkusb/]]</nowiki>

Check the corresponding md5sum.

<pre>
md5sum mkusb-bas
</pre>
and make it executable
<pre>
chmod ugo+x mkusb-bas
</pre>
Then is can be run with superuser permissions (with sudo or as root depending on the linux distro) in the current directory
<pre>
$ sudo ./mkusb-bas file.iso
</pre>
or
<pre>
</pre>

=== Alternate links ===

Download mkusb-bas in two steps: Click on the link above, and at the '''attachment page''': click on the link '''mkusb-bas''', or click on '''get''' near the bottom of the attachment page. The version 7.4.2 checks with the following data

<pre>
$ ls -l mkusb-bas
-rwxr-xr-x 1 sudodus sudodus 15576 nov 19  2014 mkusb-bas
$ md5sum mkusb-bas
32058d68d0b86910542ace1b37f581ca  mkusb-bas
</pre>

and the version 7.4.3 checks with the following data

<pre>
$ ls -l mkusb-bas
-rwxr-xr-x 1 sudodus sudodus 16245 jun 28 00:30 mkusb-bas
$ md5sum mkusb-bas
eade5b61e0ca67a2c59365036a4298e1  mkusb-bas
</pre>

If you downloaded mkusb-bas before, your internet browser may cache the old version. Please check that you get the current version.

=== TinyCore 5.4 ===
	
* The file system lacks /dev/disk/by-id, so mkusb and mkusb-nox do not work
* Install
** (for example) the web browser '''icecat''' to find and download mkusb-bas and some ISO file or other image file
** '''bash''' and '''parted''' for mkusb-bas
* Then '''mkusb-bas''' works.

=== Wary Puppy 5.5 ===

* The ISO file needs treatment with isohybrid to work when cloned to a USB pendrive. You can download the isohybrid iso file from <nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/hybrid-isos]]</nowiki>.
* The file system lacks /dev/disk/by-id and the program lsblk is missing, so mkusb and mkusb-nox do not work
* Wary Puppy can install and run '''mkusb-bas''' without further tweaks.
