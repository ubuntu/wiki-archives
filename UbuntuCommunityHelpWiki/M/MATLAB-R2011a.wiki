== Introduction ==
MATLAB® is a high-level language and interactive environment that enables you to perform computationally intensive tasks faster than with traditional programming languages such as C, C++, and Fortran.

You can use MATLAB in a wide range of applications, including signal and image processing, communications, control design, test and measurement, financial modeling and analysis, and computational biology. Add-on toolboxes (collections of special-purpose MATLAB functions, available separately) extend the MATLAB environment to solve particular classes of problems in these application areas.

MATLAB provides a number of features for documenting and sharing your work. You can integrate your MATLAB code with other languages and applications, and distribute your MATLAB algorithms and applications.

== MATLAB R2011a ==
=== Important Note Regarding Ubuntu 11.04 ===
MATLAB R2011a was released on April 8, 2011. Please note that this is prior to the release of Ubuntu 11.04. Consequently Ubuntu 11.04 is not a supported operating system for MATLAB R2011a.

MATLAB R2011a users are strongly encouraged to install R2011a on <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx|Ubuntu 10.04 LTS]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickMeerkat|Ubuntu 10.10]]</nowiki> for best results. Installation of MATLAB R2011a on unsupported Ubuntu releases are outside the scope of this documentation.

== Installation Instructions ==
 You will need superuser privileges. The assumption is that MATLAB install files are located at '''/media/MATHWORKS_R2011a''' in your filesystem.

1. Run the MATLAB installer with the following Terminal command:
<pre>
sudo /media/MATHWORKS_R2011A/install
</pre>

2. When prompted to ''''Choose installation type'''' you should select custom. This will allow you to create symbolic links to MATLAB  in '''/usr/local/bin'''.

<nowiki>[[File:../r2011a-installation-type.png|Choose installation type]]</nowiki>

3. When prompted to ''''Specify installation folder'''' it is recommended that you use the default folder '''/usr/local/MATLAB/R2011a'''.

<nowiki>[[File:../r2011a-folder-selection.png|Specify installation folder]]</nowiki>

4. When given the option to ''''Create symbolick links to MATLAB scripts in:'''' it is recommended that you check the box and use the supplied path '''/usr/local/bin'''.

=== Create A MATLAB Launcher ===

1. Get an icon:
<pre>
sudo wget http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png -O /usr/share/icons/matlab.png
</pre>

2. Get the launcher file:
<pre>
sudo wget 'https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=matlab-r2011a.desktop' -O /usr/share/applications/matlab.desktop
</pre>

If you get two MATLAB launcher icons in your Unity laucher, try adding this line to /usr/share/applications/matlab.desktop:
<pre>
StartupWMClass=com-mathworks-util-PostVMInit
</pre>

=== MEX functions ===
If you try to compile MEX functions you may see a message like the following:
<pre>

Warning: You are using gcc version "4.4.4-14ubuntu5)".  The version
         currently supported with MEX is "4.3.4".
         For a list of currently supported compilers see:
         http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/current_release/

</pre>
'''Note''' this is a warning - the MEX function will still compile.

The following instructions will setup gcc 4.3 and make it the default compiler for MATLAB:

1. Install The GNU Compiler Collection 4.3 and The GNU Standard C++ Library
<pre>
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.3-multilib libstdc++6-4.3-dev
</pre>
2. Make a MATLAB specific 'bin' directory for gcc symlink.
<pre>
mkdir ~/.matlab/bin
</pre>
3. Symlink gcc to gcc-4.3 via user MATLAB specific 'bin' directory.
<pre>
ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.3 ~/.matlab/bin/gcc
</pre>
4. Add MATLAB specific 'bin' directory to the front of your system $PATH within your local startup.m file.
<pre>
printf "setenv('PATH',sprintf('/home/%%s/.matlab/bin:%%s',getenv('USER'),getenv('PATH')));\n" >> ~/Documents/MATLAB/startup.m
</pre>

Steps 3 and 4 above may not work for at least one instance of a user trying to compile using MEX in MATLAB R2011a running on Ubuntu 10.10. An alternative is to do the following:

 3a. At the MATLAB Command Window prompt, type:
<pre>
mex -setup
</pre>
and choose option 2 which says:
<pre>
 2: /usr/local/MATLAB/R2011a/bin/mexopts.sh :
      Template Options file for building MEX-files via the system ANSI compiler
</pre>
This will copy to your home directory a local copy of the file mexopts.sh.

 4a. Then edit this local file:
<pre>
sudo gedit ~/.matlab/R2011a/mexopts.sh
</pre>
and replace all instances of CC='gcc' to CC='gcc-4.3', CXX='g++' to CXX='g++-4.3', and FC='gfortran' to FC='gfortran-4.3'. Save and exit. The next time you run MEX in MATLAB to compile it will work properly.
