Next, you need to edit the mysql configuration to allow outside hosts to connect:
<pre>
$ sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
</pre>

Look for the line that reads:
<pre>
bind-address= 127.0.0.1
   </pre>
and comment out that line by placing a ~+<code>#</code>+~ at the beginning.

Then, restart mysql:
<pre>
$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart
</pre>
