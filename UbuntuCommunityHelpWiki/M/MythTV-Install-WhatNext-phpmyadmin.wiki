==== phpmyadmin ====
phpmyadmin is a very useful tool for administering a mysql server.  If you ever run into something that you need to directly modify in the mysql tables, but don't want to go through the trouble of learning mysql commands by hand, phpmyadmin will help.  It has a web interface that will allow manipulation of tables, backup, privilege admustment and almost everything done by CLI.

Once you install phpmyadmin, I would recommend you secure your root password for it from within the interface.

To install it, 

<pre>
sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
</pre>

If you haven't installed mythweb prior to phpmyadmin, you will also need to do install a php support library for apache.  Mythweb depends on php4, by default.  Either php4 or 5 may be used, however.
To install the php5 library:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
</pre>

phpmyadmin will then be accessible by going to

http://localhost/phpmyadmin
