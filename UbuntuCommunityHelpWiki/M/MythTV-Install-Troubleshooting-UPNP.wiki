==== UPNP Support ====
If you are looking to use the support for UPNP that is included in 0.20, you will have to install both the frontend and backend packages on your master backend.  Unfortunately, a packaging bug is installing some of the necessary files for UPNP to work into the "frontend".  This will be resolved in later packages.
