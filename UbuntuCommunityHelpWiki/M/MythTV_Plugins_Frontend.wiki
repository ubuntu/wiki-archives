__TOC__

=== Frontend Only ===
The frontend has a variety of plugins available to it.  Don't install the mythplugins metapackage though, because it will also install mythweb (unless of course you want mythweb/apache running on your frontend for some reason).  Individually install the plugins packages that appeal to you.  

<pre>
sudo apt-get install PACKAGENAME
</pre>

Where PACKAGENAME is the name of the plugin that you desired installing from the top.
