== Purpose ==

At this point, you have installed Ubuntu and restarted your computer.

This page explains what you see and how to deal with it.

If you have trouble with this part, refer to the <nowiki>[[..-Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting Guide]]</nowiki>.

== EFI screen ==

When you turn on your computer, you will see a screen that looks like this.

<nowiki>[[File:EFI-boot-screen.png]]</nowiki>

You can either wait five seconds or press any key except `Esc` or `Escape`.

== OS selection prompt ==

Next, a prompt is displayed.

<nowiki>[[File:OS-selection-prompt.png]]</nowiki>

If you do nothing, after 10 seconds, Ubuntu will start.

Otherwise, use your up-arrow and down-arrow to select the system you want (Ubuntu or Windows in this example; the other two options are for advanced use only). Press `Enter` to continue.

== System passphrase prompt ==

If you choose Ubuntu, Grub prompts you for the system passphrase.

<nowiki>[[File:system-passphrase-prompt.png]]</nowiki>

Type your system passphrase (not your data passphrase or your Ubuntu login password). Nothing will be displayed on the screen while you type.

* Careful: if you enter the system passphrase incorrectly, you will see an error, and the only thing that you can do is to press `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Delete` to reboot and try again!

* If you think that you have typed something incorrectly, before you press `Enter`, press the `Backspace` key at least enough times to rub out whatever you typed, and start again.

* On some hardware, the numeric keypad is not activated at this point. So, if you wish to use the numeric keypad, you might find that you must press `Num Lock`. You'll have to figure whether or not you need this out on your own hardware; or just use the number keys above the letters.

Press `Enter` when finished. The cursor will move to the start of the next line. The computer might take a minute or so to continue, because some of the startup work is hidden for a while.

If you get the error, "No key available with this passphrase," despite trying carefully repeatedly, see the warning about keyboards in <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ManualFullSystemEncryption/Overview#Choosing_a_passphrase_and_password|Choosing a passphrase and password.]]</nowiki>

== Windows error ==

When you select Windows, you should go straight into Windows. However, some systems might show a strange error:

<nowiki>[[File:Windows-pre-boot-error.png]]</nowiki>

Ignore the error. Just press any key to continue into Windows.

== Refresh Grub after updates ==

Whenever the kernel is updated, either because you manually did something or the automatic updates kicked in, it corrupts Grub.

To mitigate this, these instructions installed an automatic process to detect this. You will receive a message to tell you that a Grub update is required, that it will be done automatically, and not to shut down or restart until it is complete. If the Software Updater asks you to restart your computer but you received this message, wait until it is safe to proceed.

<nowiki>[[File:refreshgrub warning.png]]</nowiki>

When it is safe to proceed (it could take a minute or two after the message was shown), you will receive a second message telling you that the Grub update succeeded, and you may shut down or restart.

<nowiki>[[File:refreshgrub done.png]]</nowiki>

Because of the differences in distributions, you could get a message in two or even three different ways.

== Review Troubleshooting ==

Please review the <nowiki>[[..-Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting guide]]</nowiki> so that you are aware what to do in case of a problem.
