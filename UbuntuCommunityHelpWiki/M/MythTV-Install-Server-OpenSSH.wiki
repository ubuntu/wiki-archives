=== Install OpenSSH Server ===
From this point forward, I'd recommend you have a ssh server running.  It will save a lot of typing during setup and help with debugging problems later.

Re-insert the server install CD into the drive and:

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
</pre>

Once it is installed and running, discover the ip address of this machine on your network, so you can log in remotely, if needed:

<pre>
$ ip addr
</pre>
<pre>
user@mythbackend:~$ ip addr
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:1a:92:1c:be:20 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.103/24 scope global eth0
   </pre>
Now you can log in remotely in a forwarded X session by replacing your user and address in the following command ''from the remote computer'':

<pre>
$ ssh -Y user@192.168.1.103
</pre>

You can remove the server install CD at this time.
