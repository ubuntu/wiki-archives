__TOC__

==== Airstar HD5000 ====
Support is included in the kernel, and thus no additional drivers are needed.

==== pcHDTV 3000, pcHDTV 2000 ====
Both the pcHDTV 2000 & 3000 are supported in the kernel, but need firmware to function.
The firmware can be obtained as follows:
 1) Obtain the firmware  
  <pre>
wget http://pchdtv.com/downloads/firmware.tar.gz
</pre>
 2) Extract firmware
  <pre>
tar xzzf firmware.tar.gz firmware
</pre>
 3) Copy the firmware to /lib/firmware
  <pre>
sudo cp firmware/* /lib/firmware
</pre>
 4) Clean up after yourself
  <pre>
rm firmware firmware.tar.gz
</pre>

==== ATI HDTV Wonder ====
The ATI HDTV Wonder is supported by the cx88-dvb DVB driver with the kernel, but needs firmware to function.
The firmware can be obtained as follows:

 1) Download this script.
  <nowiki>[[attachment:get_dvb_firmware]]</nowiki>
 2) Make it executable.
  <pre>
chmod +x get_dvb_firmware
</pre>
 3) Run the script to obtain the firmware
  <pre>
./get_dvb_firmware nxt2004
</pre>
 4) Copy the firmware to /lib/firmware
  <pre>
sudo cp dvb-fe-nxt2004.fw /lib/firmware
</pre>
 5) Test the module
  <pre>
sudo modprobe cx88-dvb
</pre>

==== DTV ====
For Europe, Australia, and anywhere else that the DVB standard is in use, Ubuntu and MythTV support a wide range of digital capture devices.  DVB is already compressed, so much lower-end hardware can be used for the backend provided you don't want to transcode to make the recorded video even smaller.  If the card is supported by the <nowiki>[[http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page|standard DVB drivers]]</nowiki>, it's highly likely to be supported in Ubuntu.
