On !MacBookPro 11,1, installing 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) is so similar to installing Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) that I am simply linking to that page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro11-1/Saucy

The only difference is that speakers work out of box on 14.04, but not on 13.10.

You can find out the model identifider in MacOS by following http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4132 or in Linux by typing at the terminal:<pre>
sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name
</pre>
