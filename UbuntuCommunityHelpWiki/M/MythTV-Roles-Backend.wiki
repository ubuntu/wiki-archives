== Backend Only ==
A backend only machine is typically designed to function like an appliance; without a keyboard or monitor attached.  Depending on the tuner cards chosen, the computer hardware itself doesn't necessarily have to be all that powerful.  A backend only machine requires approximately 3GB of hard drive storage for the OS.  Setting up and maintaining a backend only machine will require administration from a networked computer with an X server installed.
