== Introduction ==
MPM (MiKTeX Package Manager) is used to install packages from a MiKTeX package repository.

MPM was originally intended to be a tool for MiKTeX users. But the program can be helpful for users of other TeX systems too, because many of the MiKTeX packages are system-independent.

Its a bit like apt-get for <nowiki>[[LaTeX]]</nowiki>.

For more information see 

<nowiki>[[http://miktex.org/unx/|MiKTeX Tools]]</nowiki>

== Installation ==
Unfortunately there is no ubuntu package for MPM so you need to compile it yourself. Fortunately it is easy enough to compile. 

Steps:

* Download the package <code>MiKTeX Tools</code> from sourceforge  <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10783|Download MiKTeX Tools ]]</nowiki>

* Move the files to an appropriate place, untar them and enter the directory. Type: 
<pre>
tar -xvzf miktex-tools-2.5.2398-beta-14.tar.gz
cd  miktex-tools-2.5.2398-beta-14
</pre>
You may need to type something slightly different if the version number has changed.

* Install some  packages needed to compile the program. Type:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl3-openssl-dev 
</pre>

* Compile the program. Type:
<pre>
./configure && make
</pre>

* Install the program. Type
<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/info.png]]</nowiki> Instead of using the command <code>sudo make install</code> you can use checkinstall. Checkinstall can create a debian package. For instructions on how to use it see <nowiki>[[CheckInstall]]</nowiki>
