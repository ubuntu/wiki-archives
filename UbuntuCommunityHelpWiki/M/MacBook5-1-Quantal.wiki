=== MacBook 5,1 and Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal) ===

You can savely use this tutorial: <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook5-1/Raring|MacBook5-1/Raring]]</nowiki>. I tried both Ubuntu versions with the Ubuntu Raring tutorial and are currently sticking with 12.10. (Only because I want to use my system productive with little maintenance-overhead-risk)
