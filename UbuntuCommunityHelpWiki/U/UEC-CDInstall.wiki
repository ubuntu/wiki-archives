=== Overview ===

This tutorial covers UEC installation from the Ubuntu 10.04 Server Edition CD, and assumes a basic network topology, with a single system serving as the "all-in-one controller", and one or more nodes attached.

=== Objective ===

From this Tutorial you will learn how to install, configure, register and perform several operations on a basic UEC setup that results in a cloud with a one controller "front-end" and one or several node(s) for running Virtual Machine (VM) instances.  You will also use examples to help get you started using your own private compute cloud.

=== Tutorial ===
==== STEP 1: Prerequisites ====

To deploy a minimal cloud infrastructure, you’ll need at least two dedicated systems:
* a front end
* one or more node(s)

==== STEP 2: Install the Cloud/Cluster/Storage/Walrus Front End Server ====

# Download the 10.04 Server ISO
# When you boot, select “Install Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud”. <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:bootscreen.png]]</nowiki>
# The installer will detect if any other Eucalyptus components are present.  <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:uec1.png]]</nowiki>
# You can then choose which components to install, based on your chosen <nowiki>[[UEC-Topologies|topology]]</nowiki>. <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:uec2.png]]</nowiki>
# It will ask two other cloud-specific questions during the course of the install:
## Name of your cluster, e.g. ''cluster1''.  <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:uec3.png]]</nowiki>
## A range of public IP addresses on the LAN that the cloud can allocate to instances, e.g. ''192.168.1.200-192.168.1.249''.  <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:uec4.png]]</nowiki>

==== STEP 3: Install the Node Controller(s) ====

The node controller install is even simpler. Just make sure that you are connected to the network on which the cloud/cluster controller is already running. 

# Boot from the same ISO on the node(s)
# Select “Install Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud”
# It should detect the Cluster and preselect “Node” install for you
# Confirm the partitioning scheme
# The rest of the installation should proceed uninterrupted; complete the installation and reboot the node

'''Note:''' You can login in the node by using the username and password defined for the cloud controller host.

==== STEP 4: Register the Node(s) ====

==== STEP 5: Obtain Credentials ====

==== STEP 6: Install an image from the store ====

==== STEP 7: Run an Image ====
