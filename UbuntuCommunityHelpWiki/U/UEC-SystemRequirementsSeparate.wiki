__TOC__

The following are recommendations, rather than fixed requirements.  However, our experience in developing this documentation indicated the following suggestions.

===== Cloud Controller (CLC) =====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Hardware'''
| '''Minimum'''
| '''Suggested'''
| '''Notes'''
|-
| CPU
| 1GHz
| 2 x 2GHz
| For your cloud to scale it helps to have at least a dual core processor
|-
| Memory
| 512MB
| 2GB
| the Java web front end benefits from lots of available memory
|-
| Disk
| 5400rpm IDE
| 5400rpm SATA
| 
|-
| Disk Space
| 40GB
| 40GB
| 
|-
| Networking
| 100Mbps
| 1000Mbps
| Cloud controller may be subject to heavy traffic on a busy cloud setup
|}

===== Walrus Controller (WS3) =====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Hardware'''
| '''Minimum'''
| '''Suggested'''
| '''Notes'''
|-
| CPU
| 1GHz
| 2 x 2GHz
| For your cloud to scale it helps to have at least a dual core processor
|-
| Memory
| 512MB
| 2GB
| File serving benefits from the presence of memory for caching
|-
| Disk
| 5400rpm IDE
| 10000rpm SATA
| File serving benefits from fast disk access
|-
| Disk Space
| 40GB
| 1TB
| Disk space will condition image storage as well as user data
|-
| Networking
| 100Mbps
| 1000Mbps
| Walrus may be subject to heavy traffic on a busy cloud setup and image needs to be copied over the network to NC at startup: faster network will mean faster initial instanciation time
|}

===== Cluster + Storage Controllers (CC + EBS) =====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Hardware'''
| '''Minimum'''
| '''Suggested'''
| '''Notes'''
|-
| CPU
| 1GHz
| 2 x 2GHz
| For your cloud to scale it helps to have at least a dual core processor
|-
| Memory
| 512MB
| 2GB
| Block storage serving benefits from the presence of memory for caching
|-
| Disk
| 5400rpm IDE
| 10000rpm SATA
| Block storage serving benefits from fast disk access
|-
| Disk Space
| 40GB
| 1TB
| Disk space will condition block stora capacity
|-
| 2 Network interfaces
| 100Mbps
| 1000Mbps
| Cluster will be subject to heavy traffic on a busy cloud setup as it will act as a router for all instances started on NC it Controls and will provide block storage (if needed) to them
|}

===== Node(s) (NC) =====

The other system(s) are nodes, which will run the node controller (NC)

These systems will actually run the instances.  You will need one or more systems with:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Hardware'''
| '''Minimum'''
| '''Suggested'''
| '''Notes'''
|-
| CPU
| VT extensions
| VT, 64-bit, Multicore
| 64-bit can run both i386, and amd64 instances; by default, Eucalyptus will only run 1 VM per CPU core on a Node
|-
| Memory
| 1GB
| 4GB
| additional memory means more, and larger guests
|-
| Disk
| 5400rpm IDE
| 7200rpm SATA or SCSI
| Eucalyptus nodes are disk-intensive; I/O wait will likely be the performance bottleneck
|-
| Disk Space
| 40GB
| 100GB
| images will be cached locally, Eucalyptus does ''not'' like to run out of disk space
|-
| Networking
| 100Mbps
| 1000Mbps
| machine images are hundreds of MB, and need to be copied over the network to nodes
