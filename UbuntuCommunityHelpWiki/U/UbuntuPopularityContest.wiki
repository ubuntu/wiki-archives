== Introduction ==
The Ubuntu Popularity Contest (or popcon, in short) gathers statistics determining which packages are the most popular with Ubuntu users. Once a week, the popularity-contest package submits data to a central server (<nowiki>[[http://popcon.ubuntu.com/]]</nowiki>). The data are then processed anonymously to generate the statistics available on <nowiki>[[http://popcon.ubuntu.com/]]</nowiki>.

Popcon's statistics are of big importance to Ubuntu developers. They can use the data to determine which packages to include on the CDs, which bugs need to be fixed first, or <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/gai-popcon|to order the results of searches within package managers]]</nowiki>.
