=== Introduction ===

The automatic configuration of hardware is achieved by using a two-phase boot:

1. Load a generic system from a ram disk. Determine what hardware is present, and what kernel modules to use.

2. Boot the system using the appropriate modules.

In order for changes to the module configuration to take effect in the first phase, the ram disk needs to be updated.

=== How to update the ramdisk ===

After having made changes to any of the files in /etc/initramfs-tools/, the ramdisk usually needs to be updated.
<pre>
sudo update-initramfs -u -v -k `uname -r`
</pre>
