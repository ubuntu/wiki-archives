This is a brief walkthrough for Ubuntu OEM Installation.

=== Installation Process ===

After boot of Ubuntu Desktop you select 'OEM install' at the grub menu. The illustration is from Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.3 LTS.

The following illustrations were made with old versions of Ubuntu, but are still relevant to show the work flow.

You go straight to the ''systems batch name'' selection window. This name will be used for bug reports.

=== System Restart ===

After rebooting the system you will automatically log in with the temporary oem user.

=== Configuration ===

* Now you can install additional software, drivers or configure the system as desired.
* When you're done doing that, click on the '''Prepare for shipping to end user''' icon on the desktop.

This removes the ''oem'' user on next boot.

=== Cloning ===

* Make an image of the oem-installed system at this stage.
* Clone from this image to the target computers.

=== End User's First Boot ===

Once the computer is shipped to an end user and is booted for the first time a setup wizard will help set up location, keyboard layout, user name etc.
