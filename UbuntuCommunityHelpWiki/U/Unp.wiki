== Introduction ==
Unp is a small perl script which makes extraction of any archive files
(see FileCompression)
a bit easier. It support several compressors and archiver programs,
chooses the right one(s) automatically and extracts one or more files
in one go.

== Installation ==
<pre>
sudo apt-get install unp
</pre>

== Usage ==
Method 1 (unpack all archives in a directory):
<pre>
unp *.*
</pre>

Method 2 (unpack, for example, all .rar archives in a directory):
<pre>
unp *.rar
</pre>

Method 3 (unpack 1 archive):
<pre>
unp archivefile
</pre>

Method 4 (unpack several archives at the same time):
<pre>
unp archivefile1 archivefile 2
</pre>

== Problem ==
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> It doesn't extract files from RAR archives with full path!
