== Introduction ==

This page describes setting up the <nowiki>[[Evolution]]</nowiki> Mail Client to access your email from your Google Mail (or 'Gmail') account.  There are two basic steps to this process.  First you enable your Google Mail account so that mail can be sent and received through <nowiki>[[POP]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[SMTP]]</nowiki>.  Second you set up Evolution to access your Google Mail account.

== Enable Gmail POP/SMTP Access ==
This is the first step and will only have to be done once.  If you decide to set up another mail client using this account, you will '''not''' have to do this step again.

# Log into your Google Mail account at http://www.gmail.com
# Click on the '''settings''' button in the top right hand corner.

== Using Google with Evolution in Other Ways ==

As stated, the above instructions are for setting up <nowiki>[[WikiPedia:Post_Office_Protocol| POP ]]</nowiki> access to a Google Mail / Google Apps mail / Gmail account.  Access using <nowiki>[[WikiPedia:IMAP]]</nowiki> is also possible, although this could be confusing due to different email paradigms.  For example, there is no concept of labels in IMAP.

<nowiki>[[http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77657| This ]]</nowiki> is Google's description of how they have resolved some of the differences.  Their  <nowiki>[[http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&ctx=mail&answer=75725| Getting started with IMAP for Gmail ]]</nowiki> page links to instructions for various email clients, but at the time of writing Evolution is not included, so consider <nowiki>[[http://www.linuxloop.com/2008/01/06/gmail-evolution-and-imap/| these ]]</nowiki> instead.

In addition to email, the <nowiki>[[Evolution| main Evolution page]]</nowiki> here also has information/links for Google Calendar integration, and getting Evolution contacts into Google Mail.
