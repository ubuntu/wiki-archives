__TOC__

The following are recommendations, rather than fixed requirements.  However, our experience in developing this documentation indicated the following suggestions.

===== Front End =====

Use the following table for a system that will run one or more of:
* the cloud controller (clc)
* the cluster controller (cc)
* walrus (the S3-like storage service)
* the storage controller (sc)

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Hardware'''
| '''Minimum'''
| '''Suggested'''
| '''Notes'''
|-
| CPU
| 1GHz
| 2 x 2GHz
| for an all-in-one front end, it helps to have at least a dual core processor
|-
| Memory
| 2GB
| 4GB
| the Java web front end benefits from lots of available memory
|-
| Disk
| 5400rpm IDE
| 7200rpm SATA
| slower disks will work, but will yield much longer instance startup times
|-
| Disk Space
| 40GB
| 200GB
| 40GB is only enough space for only a single image, cache, etc., Eucalyptus does ''not'' like to run out of disk space
|-
| Networking
| 100Mbps
| 1000Mbps
| machine images are hundreds of MB, and need to be copied over the network to nodes
|}

===== Node(s) =====

The other system(s) are nodes, which will run:
* the node controller (nc)

These systems will actually run the instances.  You will need one or more systems with:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Hardware'''
| '''Minimum'''
| '''Suggested'''
| '''Notes'''
|-
| CPU
| VT extensions
| VT, 64-bit, Multicore
| 64-bit can run both i386, and amd64 instances; by default, Eucalyptus will only run 1 VM per CPU core on a Node
|-
| Memory
| 1GB
| 4GB
| additional memory means more, and larger guests
|-
| Disk
| 5400rpm IDE
| 7200rpm SATA or SCSI
| Eucalyptus nodes are disk-intensive; I/O wait will likely be the performance bottleneck
|-
| Disk Space
| 40GB
| 100GB
| images will be cached locally, Eucalyptus does ''not'' like to run out of disk space
|-
| Networking
| 100Mbps
| 1000Mbps
| machine images are hundreds of MB, and need to be copied over the network to nodes
