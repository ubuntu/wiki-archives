__TOC__

Nodes are the physical systems within UEC that actually run the virtual machine instances of the cloud.

Once one or more Ubuntu Server node(s) are installed and running the ''eucalyptus-nc'' service, log onto the Cloud Controller and run:
<pre>
sudo euca_conf --no-rsync --discover-nodes
</pre>

This will discover the systems on the network running the ''eucalyptus-nc'' service, and the administrator can confirm the registration of each node by its IP address.

* ''Note: If you get prompted for passwords, or receive errors from scp, you may need to revisit the key synchronization instructions at <nowiki>[[UEC-NodeInstallation]]</nowiki>.''
