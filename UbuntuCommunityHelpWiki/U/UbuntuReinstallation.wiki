Sometimes reinstalling is the quickest way to solve a problem, for example if an upgrade failed or if your graphics driver is broken. When reinstalling, you're most likely want to preserve two things:

1. ```/home folder``` with your files and settings
2. Entries in boot menu (if you have multiple OS installed)

== How To Reinstall Ubuntu ==

Since Hardy it is possible to reinstall Ubuntu '''without losing the content of the /home folder''' (the folder that contains program settings, internet bookmarks, emails and all your documents, music, videos and other user files).
This can be done '''even if /home is not on a separate partition''' (which is the case by default if you did not manually separate it when installing Ubuntu originally).
This tutorial can also be used to upgrade Ubuntu (eg 11.04 -> 12.04 from a 12.04 live-CD).

=== Before doing anything ===

This operation should not damage your documents but, for security, backup your documents and settings (including /home hidden files) on external disk or DVDs. (eg via <nowiki>[[http://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live.php|CloneZilla]]</nowiki>)
'''Note:''' Some special applications settings may be in system folders, eg LAMP, see below in the thread.

=== Run the Ubuntu installer ===
## Run the UbuntuInstaller
## Follow the prompts until the "Installation type" (or "Allocate disk space") menu
## Choose the right option as described below:

=== Choose the right option ===

There are two possibilities - choose the one that fits what the installer is showing:

- '''If an "Upgrade 1X.XX to 1Y.YY" option is available''' (like in the screenshot below), choose it.

- Or, '''if the above option is not available''', choose manual partitioning ("Something-else" option), then select Ubuntu system partition, set its mount point as "/". '''Be sure to keep the same format type, the same size, and untick the "Format" checkbox or all data on "/" will be deleted!'''. Also set other partitions (/boot, /home... see <nowiki>[[DiskSpace]]</nowiki>) if needed.

Then finish the installation process. (this may take several hours, like a normal install)

=== After reinstalling ===

After reinstalling, user accounts must be re-created with the '''same login and password.'''
