== Introduction ==

This guide is designed for the beginning user who is new to Ardour.  It is written assuming you are recording from one mono input, such as a microphone.

This page is under development.

== Create a Track ==

1. In the Track menu, select 'Add Track/Bus'.

<nowiki>[[File:new_track.png]]</nowiki>

2. For now, add one mono track in normal mode.

3. Click 'add'.

4. To rename the track simply click on its name (Audio 1) and type in the name you want.

== Arm Track to Record ==

=== Select Input Source ===

1. In the 'Window' menu, select 'Show Mixer.'

2. On the strip for the track you just created, click on the 'Input' button

<nowiki>[[File:mixer_input.png]]</nowiki>

3. Ardour will show a list of available inputs.  You need to select the one to which your microphone is physically connected.

=== Arm Track and Set Levels ===

1. Directly below the 'Input' button, click on 'Record'.

2. Talk into your microphone.  You should now see movement on the track's level meter.  If there is none, check your soundcard's settings, or try selecting a different input.

3. Set your levels to an appropriate level.  If the levels are set too high, your recording will be distorted.  If they are too low, your recording will be quiet and noisy.

== Record Your Audio ==

1. Back in the main Ardour window, click the 'Record' button (the red circle).  It will blink, we are 'almost' recording!

2. Click the 'Play' arrow and you're on!  Click stop when you're done.

== Multitracking ==

Just start over from the top, adding a new track.  Ardour will automatically align your tracks to compensate for the latency in Jack.  You can have as many tracks as your hard drive and processor can handle.
