== No Answer in the IRC Chatroom! ==

If you're here, chances are you have been to our IRC channel asking for help and received no answer. Since the Ubuntu Studio team is a fairly small group of volunteers with varying schedules around the world, this can happen.

However, you're still in luck and there are still ways to get help via IRC. If the issue is related to...

 - the '''user interface (desktop environment)''', the '''Xubuntu''' team is happy to help in '''#xubuntu'''.<<BR>>
 - a '''specific application''', try the channel for that particular app. For instance, '''Ardour''' help can typically be found in '''#ardour'''. See the application's website for details. If you don't know where the website is, try a web search (Google, !DuckDuckGo, etc.)<<BR>>
 - a problem with the '''operating system''' (configuration, boot, etc.) there is plenty of support in '''#ubuntu'''.

In any case, please be patient. In the words of our trusty IRC bot Ubottu, ''"Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or https://ubuntuforums.org or https://askubuntu.com/"''.
