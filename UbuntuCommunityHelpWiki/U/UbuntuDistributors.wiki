__TOC__

This page lists suppliers that can provide Ubuntu CDs and DVDs to you, and you can simply google a local supplier. There are also other methods of GettingUbuntu.

This very old list of suppliers contained links that were broken or had been taken over by other parties.  The list has been removed.
