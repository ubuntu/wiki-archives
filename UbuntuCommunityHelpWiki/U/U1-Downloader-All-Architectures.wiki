== I have a 32-bit/64-bit computer, will the script work? ==

Yes, it should.  For Windows and MacOS, we provide a 32-bit version of the program which should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit hosts.  For Linux, we provide a 64-bit version by default to reduce dependence on 32-bit libraries, but we also offer a 32-bit version for older computers.

The 32-bit Linux version is here: http://ubuntuone.com/u1-downloader/u1-downloader-32b.tar.gz
