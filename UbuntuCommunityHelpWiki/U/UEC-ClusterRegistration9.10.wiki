__TOC__

The Cluster Controller service is provided by the ''eucalyptus-cc'' package.

If this service is running on the same system as the ''eucalyptus-cloud'' service, then registration is automatic.

Otherwise, you need to manually register the cluster with the ''eucalyptus-cloud'' service by defining the cluster's name, and the one or more IP addresses of the cluster controllers.

On the Cloud Controller:
* Define the shell variable '''CC_NAME''' in <code>/etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-cc.conf</code>
* Define the shell variable '''CC_IP_ADDR''' in <code>/etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-ipaddr.conf</code>, as a space separated list of one or more IP addresses.

Then, on the ''Cloud Controller'', run:
<pre>
sudo start eucalyptus-cc-registration
</pre>
