__TOC__



A wide range of astronomical software is available for Ubuntu.

=== Official packages ===

Ubuntu includes many packages useful for astronomy and astrophysics.
==== Stellarium ====
Stellarium is a free open source planetarium for your computer. It shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope.
Developed at ESO, and used as a base in VirGO, a VO tool for European astronomers.

==== Celestia ====

''A real-time visual space simulation''

Choose a point within the Local Group of galaxies, and Celestia will show you an approximation of how it would appear to your eyes were you actually there. Orbit a couple kilometers above the surface of a tiny, irregular asteroid, then head off towards Jupiter, watching it grow from a bright point of light into a looming sphere filling your field of vision.  

Leave our solar system entirely and observe the sun as it fades from a brilliant disk to a bright star, disappearing almost entirely as you head off toward the Upsilon Andromeda system to orbit around its innermost giant planet.

''Celestia is available with a range of front-ends''

==== Fv ====

''A tool for viewing and editing FITS-format files''

Fv provides a graphical user interface to data stored in FITS
(Flexible Image Transport System) files.  Local files can be created,
viewed and edited, files on the internet can be opened read-only
through the http and ftp protocols.  Through the POWplot program,
FITS data can be visualized in a large variety of styles.  An
interface to the Sky-View online database allows for searching,
downloading, and plotting of images and object lists for a region of
the sky.

''FITS support is also available through The GIMP''

==== GCX ====

''Astronomical image processing and photometry''

Gcx is an astronomical image processing and data reduction tool,
with an easy to use graphical user interface. It provides a
complete set of data reduction functions for CCD photometry,
with frame WCS fitting, automatic star identification, aperture
photometry of target and standard stars, single-frame ensemble
photometry solution finding, multi-frame color coefficient
fitting, extinction coefficient fitting, and all-sky photometry;
as well as general-purpose astronomical image processing functions
(bias, dark, flat, frame alignment and stacking); It can function
as a FITS viewer.

The program can control CCD cameras and telescopes, and implement
automatic observation scripting. Cameras are controlled through a
hardware-specific server, to which gcx connects through a TCP socket.
It generates FITS files with comprehensive header information.

==== IFRIT ====

''A powerful tool for visualizing 3-dimensional data sets''

IFRIT (the Ionization FRont Interactive Tool) has its origins (and
hence name) in a specialized utility designed to visualize ionization
fronts in cosmological numerical simulations.  IFRIT, however, has
outgrown its origins and now can visualize general data sets as well.

==== KStars ====

''A desktop planetarium application''

KStars is a graphical desktop planetarium for KDE.  It depicts an
accurate simulation of the night sky, including stars, constellations,
star clusters, nebulae, galaxies, all planets, the Sun, the Moon,
comets and asteroids.  You can see the sky as it appears from any
location on Earth, on any date.

The user interface is highly intuitive and flexible.  The display can
be panned and zoomed with the mouse, and you can easily identify
objects and track their motion across the sky.  KStars includes many
powerful features, yet the interface is clean and simple and fun to use.
