== Can I resume my downloader later if it stops or fails? ==
Yes.  You just need to run the script again (basically, you can repeat the final step) and this will check which files you already have on your disk.  If any file failed to download correctly, it will be downloaded again.  Missing files from previous runs will also be downloaded.

You can abort the download and resume it later as many times as you like.  However, if you stop in the middle of a large file, it might start that file again from the beginning, so we recommend trying to complete the download of at least one file per run.
