__TOC__

The following is by far the simplest way to install an image.  However, advanced users may be interested in learning how to <nowiki>[[UEC-BundlingImages|Bundle their own image]]</nowiki>.

The simplest way to add an image to UEC is to install it from the Image Store on the UEC web interface.

 1. Access the web interface at the following URL (Make sure you specify https):
 <pre>
https://<cloud-controller-ip-address>:8443/
</pre>
 2. Enter your login and password (if requested, as you may still be logged in from earlier)
 3. Click on the Store tab
 <nowiki>[[File:Private-store-cr.png]]</nowiki>
 4. Browse available images
 5. Click on install for the image you want

Once the image has been downloaded and installed, you can click on "How to run?" that will be displayed below the image button to view the command to execute to instantiate (start) this image.  The image will also appear on the list given on the Image tab.
