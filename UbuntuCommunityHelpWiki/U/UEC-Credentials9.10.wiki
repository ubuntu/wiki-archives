__TOC__

After installing and booting the Cloud Controller, users of the cloud will need to retrieve their ''credentials''.  This can be done either through a web browser, or at the command line.

===== From a Web Browser =====

1. From your web browser (either remotely or on your Ubuntu server) access the following URL:
<pre>
https://<cloud-controller-ip-address>:8443/
</pre>
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="background-color: #91f49f;"> '''Important!''' You must use a secure connection, so make sure you use "https" not "http" in your URL.  You will get a security certificate warning.  You will have to add an exception to view the page. If you do not accept it you will not be able to view the Eucalyptus configuration page.

# Use username 'admin' and password 'admin' for the first time login (you will be prompted to change your password). 
# Then follow the on-screen instructions to update the admin password and email address. 
# Once the first time configuration process is completed, click the 'credentials' tab located in the top-left portion of the screen. <<BR>><nowiki>[[File:UECcredentials-2.png]]</nowiki>
# Click the 'Download Credentials' button to get your certificates
# Save them to <code>~/.euca</code>
# Unzip the downloaded zipfile into a safe location (~/.euca)
<pre>
unzip -d ~/.euca mycreds.zip
</pre>

===== From a Command Line =====
1. Alternatively, if you are on the command line of the Cloud Controller, you can run:
<pre>
mkdir -p ~/.euca
chmod 700 ~/.euca
cd ~/.euca
sudo euca_conf --get-credentials mycreds.zip
unzip mycreds.zip
cd -
</pre>

===== Extracting and Using Your Credentials =====
Now you will need to setup EC2 API and AMI tools on your server using X.509 certificates. 
1. Source the included "eucarc" file to set up your Eucalyptus environment
<pre>
. ~/.euca/eucarc
</pre>
1. You may additionally wish to add this command to your ~/.bashrc file so that your Eucalyptus environment is set up automatically when you log in.  Eucalyptus treats this set of credentials as 'administrator' credentials that allow the holder global privileges across the cloud.  As such, they should be protected in the same way that other elevated-priority access is protected (e.g. should not be made visible to the general user population).
<pre>
echo "[ -r ~/.euca/eucarc ] && . ~/.euca/eucarc" >> ~/.bashrc
</pre>
1. Install the required cloud user tools:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install euca2ools
</pre>
1. To validate that everything is working correctly, get the local cluster availability details:
<pre>
. ~/.euca/eucarc
euca-describe-availability-zones verbose

</pre>
