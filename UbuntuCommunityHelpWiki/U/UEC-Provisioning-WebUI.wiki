__TOC__

To trigger automated installations of UEC components, preseed configuration files must be generated which detail all of the installation parameters, and signal must be sent to the target hosts.

This involves:
* a preseed template
* configuration information about target systems
* a cgi-bin web service for initiating installs

=== Install the Code ===
* ''NOTE: This packaging is currently a work in progress, in <code>ppa:uec-provisioning/ppa</code>...''
<pre>
sudo apt-get install uec-provisioning-webui
</pre>

=== Customize the Configuration ===
Add your MAC and IP addresses to the configuration file, <code>/etc/uec-provisioning/hosts.cfg</code>.
<pre>
sudo vi /etc/uec-provisioning/hosts.cfg
</pre>

=== Poweroff the Target Host ===

Make sure the the target host is configured for <nowiki>[[UEC-Provisioning-WakeOnLan|WakeOnLan]]</nowiki>, and then power the host down.

=== Start the Installation ===

# Point a web browser at the host running the <code>uec-provisioning-webui</code>, such as <nowiki>[[http://localhost/cgi-bin/uec.py]]</nowiki>.
# Select the host to install.  If your desired host is missing in this list, you should configure it properly in <code>/etc/uec-provisioning/hosts.cfg</code>.
# Choose the components you want to install on this host.  Refer to <nowiki>[[UEC-Topologies]]</nowiki> if necessary. <nowiki>[[File:webui.png]]</nowiki>
