=== Overview ===
This tutorial covers UEC installation by adding the Eucalyptus packages to previously installed Ubuntu 10.04 servers.

You can also find instructions on adding Eucalyptus to <nowiki>[[UEC-PackageInstall9.10|Ubuntu 9.10 Servers]]</nowiki>.

=== Objective ===

From this tutorial, you will learn how to install, configure, register and perform several operations on a basic UEC setup that results in a cloud with a one controller "front-end" and one node for running Virtual Machine (VM) instances.

=== Tutorial ===
==== STEP 1: Prerequisites ====
To deploy a minimal cloud infrastructure, you’ll need at least two dedicated systems:
* a ''Front End''
* one or more ''Node(s)''

==== STEP 2: Install the Cloud/Cluster/Storage/Walrus Front End Server(s) ====
# <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/installation.html|Install Ubuntu 10.04 Server]]</nowiki>
# Update to the most current state in the Ubuntu archive:
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>
1. Install the eucalyptus-cloud and eucalyptus-cc packages on the ''Front End'':
<pre>
sudo apt-get install eucalyptus-cloud eucalyptus-cc eucalyptus-walrus eucalyptus-sc
</pre>
 Answer debconf's questions:
** Configure postfix for ''internet'' delivery
** Name your cluster
*** e.g. cluster1
** Add a list of available IP addresses on your network
*** e.g. 192.168.1.200-192.168.1.249

 ''Note:'' Depending on the number of systems you will be setting up, you may not want to install all the above packages on the same system. For best results, have a look at some <nowiki>[[UEC-Topologies|recommended topologies]]</nowiki>.

==== STEP 3: Install and Configure the Node Controller(s) ====

==== STEP 4: Register the Walrus, Cluster, Storage, and Node Controllers ====

==== STEP 5: Obtain Credentials ====

==== STEP 6: Install an image from the store ====

==== STEP 7: Run an Image ====

Your UEC cloud should now look similar to the following logical diagram:
