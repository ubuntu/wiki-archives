The '''Ubuntu Forums Firefox Menu Extension''' add-on provides easy access to all the individual sections of the Ubuntu Forums along with other handy links to make your experience of using the forums more convenient.

The <nowiki>[[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ubuntu-forums-menu/|original software]]</nowiki> has not been maintained by the original author <nowiki>[[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10363/|(Adam Smith)]]</nowiki> but I have modified and tested it on an ongoing basis to keep it up to date and it has been available in the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=846920|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki>.

The latest add-on version - modified 2nd March 2013 - is available here: <nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu_forums_menu-0.82-fx.xpi]]</nowiki>

Once installed, go into the Extension Preferences to add it to your Main Menu or Context bar.

Tested as working with Firefox 19.0
