__TOC__

== I got a X509_load_cert_crl_file error.  What should I do? ==
This happens when the system can't find or can't load the '''cacert.pem''' file.  Sometimes this is simply a file permission issue, and you can work around it by running '''sudo ./u1_downloader''' instead of the regular method without sudo.  But this is uncommon.

It also happens if you forget to cd into the u1-downloader dir before running the app.

To work around the issue in the more general case, you may need to run the U1 downloader app from source instead of using the binary.  To do this, first install the required packages:

  '''$ sudo apt-get install bzr python-virtualenv'''

Then branch the U1 downloader app from Launchpad:

  '''$ bzr branch lp:~toykeeper/+junk/u1-downloader'''

Then follow the instructions in the '''readme.txt''' file inside that new source code branch.
