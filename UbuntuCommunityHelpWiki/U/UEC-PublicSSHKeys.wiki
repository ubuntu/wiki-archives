__TOC__

The Cloud Controller's ''eucalyptus'' user needs to have SSH access to the Walrus Controller, Cluster Controller, and Storage Controller as the ''eucalyptus'' user.

Install the Cloud Controller's ''eucalyptus'' user's public ssh key by:
** On the target controller, temporarily set a password for the ''eucalyptus'' user:
<pre>
sudo passwd eucalyptus
</pre>
** Then, on the Cloud Controller:
<pre>
sudo -u eucalyptus ssh-copy-id -i /var/lib/eucalyptus/.ssh/id_rsa.pub eucalyptus@<IP_OF_NODE>
</pre>
** You can now remove the password of the ''eucalyptus'' account on the target controller, if you wish:
<pre>
sudo passwd -d eucalyptus
</pre>
