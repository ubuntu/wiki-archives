== I'm getting linker/library errors. Can I run the downloader from source code? ==
Yes, a source version is available.  This should help with errors such as "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found".  To run it from source, first install the required packages:

  '''$ sudo apt-get install bzr python-virtualenv'''

Then branch the U1 downloader app from Launchpad:

  '''$ bzr branch lp:~toykeeper/+junk/u1-downloader'''

Then follow the instructions in the '''readme.txt''' file inside that new source code branch.
