== Try Ubuntu Studio before installing it ==

Ubuntu Studio 12.04 LTS is a live image, which means you can boot from it and use all of the default Ubuntu Studio applications without installing it. Just burn a DVD, or make your USB stick bootable and try it out.

=== Notes on partitioning and dual booting ===

Otherwise, the default option presented during the installation (will overwrite everything on the hard disk) is the best choice.
