__TOC__

'''Abstract'''
This page is to document the various aspects of the application selection used in Ubuntu Studio.

== Inclusion/Exclusion Reasons ==
'''gnome-network-manager'''<<BR>>
gnome-network-manager was included because network-manager degrades performance.

'''supercollider'''<<BR>>
Not included in archives due to at least one proprietary file.

'''superlooper'''<<BR>>
apparently is in the archives under Universe and can be included in Ubuntu Studio.

'''linuxsampler'''<<BR>>
Not included in Ubuntu Studio because it cannot be included in the archives because the license is GPL-3 with a special "commercial exception".  For more information see <nowiki>[[http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2010/03/12/%23ubuntustudio-devel.txt|this IRC log]]</nowiki> starting at 14:21.

'''Audacious'''<<BR>>
Audacious is included rather than Rhythmbox or other media players because Audacious allows you to open and play a single file rather than maintain a library.

This is advantageous when creating a new mix of a song and you want to listen to the new mix easily.
