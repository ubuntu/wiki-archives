__TOC__


The Storage Controller service is provided by the ''eucalyptus-sc'' package.

If this service is running on the same system as the ''eucalyptus-cloud'' service, then registration occurs automatically.

Otherwise, you need to manually register the storage with the ''eucalyptus-cloud'' service by defining the cluster's name, and the one or more IP addresses of the storage controllers.

On the Cloud Controller:
* Define the cluster name in the shell variable '''CC_NAME''' in <code>/etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-cc.conf</code>
* Define the shell variable '''SC_IP_ADDR''' in <code>/etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-ipaddr.conf</code>, as a space separated list of one or more IP addresses.

Then, on the ''Cloud Controller'', run:
<pre>
sudo start eucalyptus-sc-registration
</pre>
