__TOC__

The Walrus service is provided by the ''eucalyptus-walrus'' package.

If this service is running on the same system as the ''eucalyptus-cloud'' service, then registration occurs automatically.

Otherwise, you need to manually register walrus with the ''eucalyptus-cloud'' service by defining the walrus IP address, and starting the registration job.

On the Cloud Controller:
* Define the shell variable '''WALRUS_IP_ADDR''' in <code>/etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-ipaddr.conf</code>, as a single IP address.

Then, on the ''Cloud Controller'', run:
<pre>
sudo start eucalyptus-walrus-registration
</pre>
