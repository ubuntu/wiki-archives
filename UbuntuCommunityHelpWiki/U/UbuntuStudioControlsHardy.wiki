''This document is for Ubuntu Studio 8.04LTS Hardy Heron.  For Ubuntu Studio Controls for the current Ubuntu Studio release please see UbuntuStudioControls for instructions and explanations.''

=== Ubuntu Studio Controls Panel ===

=== memlock ===
Dedicating locked memory via ''memlock'' setting to audio applications while using the -RT kernel can increase performance while reduce latency and xruns.

By default no memory is locked for audio applications.

To set ''memlock'' click to enable it and enter a percentage of available memory to lock for audio applications.  This will modify the contents of the /etc/security/limits.conf file.

<nowiki>[[http://jackaudio.org/faq|Jackaudio.org/faq]]</nowiki> suggests setting ''memlock'' to unlimited.

<nowiki>[[http://tapas.affenbande.org/wordpress/?page_id=73|Florian Paul Schmidt's page]]</nowiki> suggests locking 50% of available memory.

The amount of memory you choose to lock could also be a function of how much memory you have available.

=== raw1394 ===
Enabling ''raw1394'' (IEEE 1394 aka firewire) access enables users to access hard drives, cameras, camcorders and sound cards without root permission.  This is accomplished by changing /etc/udev/rules.d/40-permissions.rules.

By default permission for ''raw1394'' access is restricted to root privileges.

'''N.B.  This can be a security risk''' which is noted when you click to enable ''raw1394'' access.
