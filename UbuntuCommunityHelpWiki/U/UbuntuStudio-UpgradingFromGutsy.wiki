Instead of reinstalling Ubuntu Studio, you can upgrade to it from a current Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon install.

* Install Ubuntu Studio: <pre> 
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop ubuntustudio-audio ubuntustudio-audio-plugins ubuntustudio-graphics ubuntustudio-video linux-rt
</pre>
* ''Optional:'' Change the theme to UbuntuStudio. In the Ubuntu menu, select ''System'' -> ''Preferences'' -> ''Appearance'' -> ''Theme'' and select ''UbuntuStudio'' from the list of themes that is presented to you. Then select ''System'' -> ''Administration'' -> ''Login Window'', enter your password, and select ''UbuntuStudio'' in the list of Login Window themes that is presented to you in the ''Local'' tab.
'''Note''': This installs a complete system. If you only want an audio, graphics, or video platform, remove the other respective packages.
