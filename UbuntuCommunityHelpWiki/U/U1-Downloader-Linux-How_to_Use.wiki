== How do I install and use the downloader? ==

# Download the script from http://ubuntuone.com/u1-downloader/u1-downloader.tar.gz
# Open a terminal (open the dash menu and start writing terminal, and click on the icon)
# Go to the folder where you downloaded the file (probably Downloads).  To do this, type the following command and then press Enter: '''cd Downloads'''
# Next, run this command to uncompress the program: '''tar zxf u1-downloader.tar.gz'''
# Go to the program's newly-created directory by running: '''cd u1-downloader'''
# Start the program by running: '''./u1_downloader'''
# You’ll be prompted for your credentials: enter your email and hit enter, then type in your password and hit enter.  If needed, you'll be asked for your 2-factor authentication code as well.

Your files will start downloading and will be saved in the '''u1-files''' directory (you can access this folder with the file manager)

In the unlikely event that any files failed to download, we recommend trying again.  It will detect which files aren't complete, and attempt to download only those files.
