An essential step is to enable password less authentication for the eucalyptus user on all the controllers.

Repeat the following operation for each walrus (WS3) and cluster (CC) controller servers:

1. On the target (CC or WS3)  Controller, temporarily set a password for the ''eucalyptus'' user:
<pre>
sudo passwd eucalyptus
</pre>

1. Then, on the Cloud Controller (CLC):
<pre>
sudo -u eucalyptus ssh-copy-id -i ~eucalyptus/.ssh/id_rsa.pub eucalyptus@<IP_OF_TARGET>
</pre>

1. You can now remove the password of the ''eucalyptus'' account on the target:
<pre>
sudo passwd -d eucalyptus
</pre>
